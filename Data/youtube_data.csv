focus on yourself not others motivational video,grab the power of words visit our store focus on yourself not others motivational video,today i need you to embrace what comes hard to day i need you to accept the challenge today i need you to fall in love with the process there will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged to lose your passion and think that its not meant to be but if youre going to reach your destiny you have to have a madeup mind if you give up after the first time or the fifth time or the th time what that really means is you didnt want it bad enough there should be something youre believing for that you are relentless you are not moved by how impossible it looks youre not discouraged by how long its taking you dont give up because people told you no youre attitude is if i have to believe my whole life i am not going to stop believing i am not going to take no for an answer im not going to settle for mediocrity im going to keep pursuing what put in my heart and ask ourself what do i really want what do i really want and write it down writing causes thinking thinking creates an image and you get these images and you get this images growing your building a vision in your mind its the visionaries thats changed the world think of that but what keeps that competitive edge what keeps you on top is the ability to think and prepare mentally over and over and over again the body has limitations the mind does not we focus so much on what goes on the neck down that we forget it all starts from here everything starts from there if youre not mentally ready youre never really physically prepared and thats where the preparation starts what would your life be like as you look toward the future if you decided im not going to allow my fears to stop me and im saying to you whatever you gotta do do it because if your dont life is gonna whoop you until you surrender so when youre young and you make mistakes dont let em eat you up cause everybody that done made it done made em you got to fail in order to win hey look man to understand how to hit the game when its shot you got to miss the game when its shot you know you got to be tough because the road to success is always under construction its never a clear path to success the people who become successful are the people who have a relentless attitude and you just got to hang in there through the bad breaks cause the bad breaks is comin but they usually come right before the big break is about to happen you get a series of bad breaks and it stumbles up a lot of people my life and my success is to say to anyone you can stumble you can fall you can get back up again,1.0

one of the greatest speeches ever steve jobs,steve jobs the exclusive biography steve jobs delivers an inspirational speech listen to the end for,today i want to tell you three stories from my life thats it no big deal just three stories music the first story is about connecting the dots i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a dropin for another months or so before i really quit so whyd i drop out it started before i was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking weve got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers that a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford and all of my workingclass parent savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldnt see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didnt interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting it wasnt all romantic i didnt have a dorm room so i slept on the floor in friends rooms i returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example read college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out and didnt have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science cant capture and i found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life ten years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac its likely that no personal computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards years later again you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the wellworn path and that will make all the difference music my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i love to do early in life was and i started apple in my parents garage when i was we worked hard and in years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned and then i got fired how can you get fired from a company you started well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at i was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating i really didnt know what to do for a few months i felt that id let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me i met with david packard and bob noyes and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit id been rejected but i was still in love and so i decided to start over i didnt see it then it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed it next is at the heart of apples current renaissance and lorraine and i have a wonderful family together im pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadnt been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometime life sometimes lifes going to hit you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did youve got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking and dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking dont settle my third story is about death when i was i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past years ive looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life what i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life its lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but its quite true your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drowned out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary stay hungry stay foolish,1.0

admiral mcraven leaves the audience speechless one of the best motivational speeches,us navy admiral william h mcraven one of the most decorated us commanders delivers one of the best motivational,what starts here changes the world i have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better world and while these lessons were learned during my time in the military i can assure you that it matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform it matters not your gender your ethnic or religious background your orientation or your social status our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all so here are the ten lessons i learned from basic seal training that hopefully will be of value to you as you move forward in life every morning in seal training my instructors who at the time were all vietnam veterans would show up in my barracks room and the first thing theyd do is inspect my bed if you did it right the corners would be square the covers would be pulled tight the pillows centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack it was a simple task mundane at best but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection it seemed a little ridiculous at the time particularly light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors tough battlehardened seals but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over if you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another and by the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into many task completed making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter if you cant do the little things right youll never be able to do the big things right and if by chance you have a miserable day you will come home to a bed that is made that you made and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better so if you want to change the world start off by making your bed music during seal training the students during training the students are all broken down into boat crews each crew is seven students three on each side of a small rubber boat and one coxon to help guide the dinghy every day your boat crew forms up on the beach and is instructed to get through the surf zone and paddle several miles down the coast in the winter the surf off san diego can get to be eight to ten feet high and it is exceedingly difficult the paddle hook through the plunging surf unless everyone digs in every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke count of the coxon everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously dumped back on the beach for the boat to make it to its destination everyone must paddle you cant change the world alone you will need some help and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends colleagues the good will of strangers and a strong coxen to guide you if you want to change the world find someone to help you paddle over a few weeks of difficult training my seal class which started with men was down to just there were now six boat crews of seven men each i was in the boat with the tall guys but the best boat crew we had was made up of little guys the munchkin crew we called them no one was over five foot five the munchkin boat crew had one americanindian one africanamerican one polish american one greek american one italian american and two tough kids from the midwest they out paddled out ran and out swam all the other boat crews the big men and the other boat crews will always make goodnatured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim but somehow these little guys from every corner of the nation in the world always had the last laugh swimming faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us seal training was a great equalizer nothing mattered but your will to succeed not your color not your ethnic background not your education not your social status if you want to change the world measure a person by the size of their heart not by the size of their flippers several times a week the instructors would line up the class and do a uniform inspection it was exceptionally thorough your hat had to be perfectly starched your uniform immaculately pressed your belt buckle shiny and void of any smudges but it seemed that no matter how much effort you put into starching your hat or pressing your uniform or polishing your belt buckle it just wasnt good enough the instructors would find something wrong for failing the uniform inspection the student had to run fully clothed into the surf zone then wet from head to toe roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand the effect was known as sugarcookie you stayed in the uniform the rest of the day cold wet and sandy there were many a student who just couldnt accept the fact that all their efforts were in vain that no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right it went unappreciated those students didnt make it through training those students didnt understand the purpose of the drill you were never going to succeed you were never going to have a perfect uniform the instructors werent going to allow it sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform you still end up as a sugar cookie its just the way life is sometimes if you want to change the world get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward every day during training you were challenged with multiple physical events long runs long swims obstacle courses hours of calisthenics something designed to test your mettle every event had standards times you had to meet if you fail to meet those times those standards your name was posted on a list and at the end of the day those on the list were invited to a circus a circus was two hours of additional calisthenics designed to wear you down to break your spirit to force you to quit no one wanted a circus a circus meant that for that day you didnt measure up a circus meant more fatigue and more fatigue meant that the following day would be more difficult and more circuses were likely but at some time during seal training everyone everyone made the circus list but an interesting thing happened to those who were constantly on the list over time those students who did two hours of extra calisthenics got stronger and stronger the pain of the circuses built inner strength and physical resiliency life is filled with circuses you will fail you will likely fail often it will be painful it will be discouraging at times it will test you to your very core but if you want to change the world dont be afraid of the circuses at least twice a week the trainees were required to run the obstacle course the obstacle course contained obstacles including the foot wall a foot cargo net a barbed wire crawl to name a few but the most challenging obstacle was the slide for life it had a three level foot tower at one end and a one level tower at the other in between was a foot long rope you had to climb the three tiered tower and once at the top you grabbed the rope swung underneath the rope and pulled yourself hand over hand until you got to the other end the record for the obstacle course had stood for years when my class began in the record seemed unbeatable until one day a student decided to go down the slide for life headfirst instead of swinging his body underneath the rope and inching his way down he bravely mounted the top of the rope and thrust himself forward it was a dangerous move seemingly foolish and fraught with risk failure could be an injury and being dropped from the course without hesitation the students slid down the rope perilously fast instead of several minutes it only took him half that time and by the end of the course he had broken the record if you want to change the world sometimes you have to slide down the obstacles headfirst during the land warfare phase of training the students are flown out to san clemente island which lies off the coast of san diego the waters off san clemente are a breeding ground for the great white sharks to pass seal training theyre a series of long swims that must be completed one is the night swim before the swim the instructors joyfully brief the students on all the species of sharks that inhabit the waters off san clemente they assure you however that no student has ever been eaten by a shark at least not that they can remember but you are also taught that if a shark begins to circle your position stand your ground do not swim away do not act afraid and if the shark hungry for a midnight snack darts towards you then summons up all your strength and punch him in the snout and he will turn and swim away there are a lot of sharks in the world if you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them so if you want to change the world dont back down from the sharpest as navy seals one of our jobs is to conduct underwater attacks against the enemys shipping we practice this technique extensively during training the ship attack mission is where a pair of seal divers is dropped off outside an enemy harbor and then swims well over two miles underwater using nothing but a depth gauge and a compass to get to the target during the entire swim even well below the surface there is some light that comes through it is comforting to know that there is open water above you but as you approach the ship which is tied to appear the light begins to fade the steel structure of the ship blocks the moonlight it blocks the surrounding streetlamps it blocks all ambient light to be successful in your mission you have to swim under the ship and find the keel the centerline and the deepest part of the ship this is your objective but the keel is also the darkest part of the show where you cannot see your hand in front of your face where the noise from the ships machinery is deafening and where it gets to be easily disoriented and you can fail every seal knows that under the keel at that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm when you must be called when you must be composed when all your tactical skills your physical power and your inner strength must be brought to bear if you want to change the world you must be your very best in the darkest moments the ninth week of training is referred to as hell week it is six days of no sleep constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the mud flats the mud flats are an area between san diego and tijuana where the rough water runs off and creates the tijuana sloughs a swampy patch of terrain where the mud will engulf you it is on wednesday of hell week that you paddle down in the mud flats and spend the next hours trying to survive this freezing cold the howling wind and the incessant pressure to quit from the instructors as the sun began to set that wednesday evening my training class having committed some egregious infraction of the rules was ordered into the mud the mud consumed each man till there was nothing visible but our heads the instructors told us we could leave the mud if only five men would quit only five minutes just five men and we could get out of the oppressive cold looking around the mud flat it was apparent that some students were about to give up it was still over eight hours till the sun came up eight more hours of bonechilling cold a chattering teeth and the shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything and then one voice began to echo through the night one voice raised in song the song was terribly out of tune but sung with great enthusiasm one voice became two and two became three and before long everyone in the class was singing the instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singing but the singing persisted and somehow the mud seemed a little warmer and the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away if i have learned anything in my time traveling the world it is the power of the power of one person the washington a lincoln king mandela and even a young girl from pakistan malala one person can change the world by giving people hope so if you want to change the world start singing when youre up to your neck in mud finally a seal training theres a bell a brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see all you have to do quit all you have to do to quit is ring the bell ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at oclock ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course the pt and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training all you have to do is ring the bell to get out if you want to change the world dont ever ever ring the bell it will not be easy start each day with a task completed find someone to help you through life respect everyone know the life is not fair that you will fail often but if you take some risks step up on the time through the toughest face down the bullies lift up the downtrodden and never ever give up if you do these things the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today and what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better thank you very much,1.0

english speech muniba mazari motivational words english subtitles,learn english with muniba mazari watch muniba spreading motivational and inspirational words in this emotional event called,first of all thank you so much for being here with us i want to ask you a few questions first of all tell me a little bit about the relationship you have with yourself with myself before the accident both both who was on social media whos using facebook everyone have you ever put your relationship status complicated my relationship with myself before i was here was so complicated it was all about people it was never about me there was no me anywhere you see peoples pleaser the person who just wants to make everyone happy knowing that its not worth it you just keep doing it keep doing it and yes your relationship eventually with yourself becomes complicated and then now i dont know where there are people around me or not but i me now im more me now thats so nice what advice would you give to your younger self to my younger self interesting question well ill just make her sit next to me and very nicely ill tell her dont invest yourself in the wrong people because when you invest yourself in the wrong people they break you into pieces they torn you apart in such a way that it takes years and years to get back together and also i will tell her that while you are busy making amazing plans in your life my dear prepare yourself for worse because life is so unpredictable just be prepared one of my philosophies in life is is that there are three steps in order to repair your life first of all is to change your personal story then your daily rituals and then the people you surround yourself i believe so much in these so tell me how important is to surround yourself with the right people time is a beautiful teacher it filters out the extras from your life including people being in the wheelchair in years ive had three categories of people number one category is of the people who see you in the misery in pain and the backoff theyre like we are gone we cant handle it i respect them for their honesty then there is another category of the people who are not there with you but they just want to cling on with you all the time theyre so weak that they try to stay in your shadow liberate yourself from those people because they are toxic for you dont let them cling on to you because theyre not there to help you liberate them liberate yourself and then there is the third category these beautiful people who are so selfless that when they see you in pain they stand next to you theyve got your back they dont share the limelight theyre just there for you these are your people value them so yes there are three categories of people try to surround yourself with those who are real and you will feel real what about jealousy what about about jealousy jealousy i pity them i pity those who see their failure in your success you know these critics they were once dreamers they just wanted to achieve something that today you have but they gave up and they started becoming jealous of you pray for them because theyre in a lot of pain one of the things that i see usually when i do therapy a lot of women they prefer to stay in a miserable relationship instead of get out the fear of being alone is greater so would you give some advice to these women we all tend to invest ourselves in relationships and as i said if you are doing something right but the wrong person nothing good will turn out and deep inside we were quite intuitive we know that its not going anywhere its okay to be on your own you are stronger than you think dont worry about that and wait for the right person let the right person come to you theres no rush are you in a good relationship with yourself do you love your own company if youre miserable alone im sorry your partner will be miserable with you so we need to understand that we need to love our own company only then people will love to enjoy our company too and dont rush wait for the right person because if its meant to be it will be one of the things i usually say is that your relationships reflect your self relationships so the most important thing is to look within to fix the most important relationship that is the relationship you have with yourself muniba i want to ask you how do you want to be remembered such a beautiful question i want to be remembered as an empath somebody who just didnt say that i feel your pain but i want people to see that when i say this i mean it and as far as my life story is concerned i dont know how my story will end maybe it will never end but yes nowhere in my text the world will ever read i gave up apart from art what kept you going in life i think all sorts of art kept me going i love music i used to sing i still sing lullabies for my son and just like painting art music is so therapeutic so i love music i dont know if the crowd would love that if its okay with you would you mind sing something for us just to listen to your voice have you watched tangled tangled rapunzel her journey how she comes out of confinement for the first time she goes out and sees the world awaits her you know what that song i see the light it reminds me of the times when i was bedridden and i used to hear the kids playing outside i couldnt see it i used to hear thunderclap i couldnt see the storms i used to hear the rain falling on the ground i couldnt see it and i missed it but when i sat in the wheelchair i stepped out went close to nature everythings changed so this beautiful song i see the light probably something id like to sing all those days watching from the windows all those years outside looking in all that time never even knowing just how blind ive been now im here blinking in the starlight now im here suddenly i see standing here its oh so clear im where im meant to be and at last i see the light and its like the fog has lifted and at last i see the light the

how long it takes to change your life nwal hadaki tedxsafirschool,have you ever wondered how long would it take you to change a habit or create a habit there is a myth and a truth about the,transcriber نوير القحطانيreviewer gia bảo nguyễn have you ever thought to yourselfbefore going to sleep tomorrow is the day i ll change tomorrow is the dayi ll get up early in the morning have a healthy breakfast go for a morning jog breath fresh air tomorrow is the day i want to changeto who i really want to be the best version of myself well change doesn t come easy you have to incorporate certain habits in your life that all eventually lead to you becoming the best version of yourself you also have to eliminate certain habits that are hindering your path well how long will it take you to form a new habitor get rid of an old one most people will tell youit takes exactly days for a person to form a habitor get rid of an old one i remember once in highschool when my teachers told me it takes exactly days for me to form a new habit and i thought this is my chance to become a bed maker i thought thatfor the next days instead of getting up every dayand yelling mom please don t forgetto make my bed today i thought i ll do it myself day by day early in the morning am even on daysi was running late i got up every morningand i made my bed and i hated every seconds of it and by day i opened my eyes and the first thing i did was say mom please don t forget to make my bed today i quit and of course that was expected and i thought okay maybe i m just gonna bea little bit worse at life than bed makers whatever i do not exaggerate if i say that this day theory is the most famous myth in the world of selfdevelopment let s dive a little into our theory to understand where the number came from and the reasons for its spreadin selfdevelopmental books and courses dr maxwell maltzwas a plastic surgeon in the s when he began noticing a strange patternamong his patients for example in a nose job he saw that the patienttook exactly days to get used to start seeinghis or her new nose he also noticed that if a patienthad an arm or leg amputated the patient would acknowledge the feelingof their new limb for exactly days before starting to get used with their new condition drmaltz published his theory in a book that went very famousin that era and sold over million copies and here the conflict started brewing and it makes sense why peoplewere starting to believe his theory why number one the number is considered a short period of time and that s also considereda short of temptation which means something you can do number two the number is also long enoughto be believable a difficult challenge but not impossible i mean who wouldn t loveto change their whole life within just days wouldn t you love to start waking up earlyin the morning every day wouldn t you love to start cookinghealthy recipes wouldn t you love to start drinkingweird smoothies and all within less than one month we d go for it in a heartbeat so is it true can we really change our liveswithin days i know that sounds very exciting but there are actually a few factorsyou d have to consider to be able to estimate the timeand it will take you to form a new habit or to get rid of an old toxic one number one is the complexity of your goal if i decide to start eating fruit daily which is considered a simple habit i d probably take less time than if i want to acquirea complex athletic skill like a tennis serve number two behavior consistency affectsthe speed of acquisition me repeating a certain behaviorfor minutes a day is different than my friend repeatingthe same behavior for minutes a day so we want to clear things up how long will it takes us to form a new habitor get rid of an old one and is there a reliable studythat we can depend on answer is yes there is a famous studyby the psychologist philippe lally titled how our habits formed the study followed people over a period of weeks each person chose a new week habit to work on such as drinking cups of waterbefore lunch or running for minutes after dinner after weeks the data was analyzedto determine the time needed to move from the old habit to start subconsciouslycarrying out the new one and after weekswe found that it took approximately two to eight months in order for the task to become a habit and days to be exact the difference in timeit took to form a habit was largely due to the task itself the person and their circumstances as some were able to form the habitwithin days while other is took days so according to psychologist lally if you want to know the timerequired to form a new habit or get rid of an old one the truth is that you may need to months and not just days guys whether it is two months three months a year two years it doesn t actually matterhow long it takes as much as it mattersthat you have to begin with today and once you begin make sure to maintain your new habit make it a part of your schedule set reminders create a supportive environment and most importantly you don t have to be perfect making a mistake once or twice has no lasting effects on your behavior actually that will give you time not to rush yourself into things you have to give yourself time and not just rush yourselfinto becoming a better version if i want to become a better person i will have to commit to the system and embrace the process that way i will commit to making tiny improvements rather than rushing myself too hard into things change is not always easy and it is not always simple but with enough dedication any habit can be reshaped so if you really want it becoming the best version of yourself get up today and start working on it i promise you all get there thank you

underwent multiple surgeries doctors have put a lot of titanium in my armsand there was a lot of titanium on my back to fix my back that s why in pakistan people called methe iron lady of pakistan sometimes i wonder how easy it is for me todescribe all this all over again and somebody has rightly said that when youshare your story and it doesn t make you cry that means you are healing those two and a half months in the hospitalwere droughtful i will not make a story just to inspire you i was on the verge of dispare one day the doctor came to me and he saidwell i heard that you want to be an artist but you ended up being a housewife i have bad news for you you won t be able to paint again becauseyour wrist and arm are so deformed you won t be able to hold the pen again and i stayed quiet next day the doctor came to me and saidyour spine injury is so bad you won t be able to walk again i took a deep breath and i said it s alright again next day the doctor came and saidbecause of your spine injury and your fixation that you have in your back you won t beable to give birth to a child again that day i was devastated i still remember i ask my mother why meand that is where i started to question my existence why am i even alive what s the point of living i couldn t walk i couldn t paint fine i cannot be a mother and we have this thingin our head being women that we are incomplete without having children i am going to be an incompletewoman for the rest of my life what s the point people are scared that they think i will getdivorced what is going to happen to me why me why am i alive we all try to chase this tunnel we all do this because we see lights at the end of the tunnelwhich keeps us going my dear friends in my situation there wasa tunnel that i had to roll on but there was no light and that is where i realized the words havethe power to heal the soul my mother said to me that this two sellpass god has a greater plan for you i don t know what it is but he surely has and all in that distress and grief mom sthose words were so magical that they kept me going i was trying to put my smile on my face allthe time hiding the pain it was so hard to hide the pain which wasthere but all i knew was that i will give up mymother and brother will give up too i cannot see them crying with me so what kept me going was one day i askedmy brother i know i have a deformed hand but i am tired of looking at these white wallsin the hospital and wearing this white scraps i am getting tired of this i want to add more colors to my life i want to do something bring me some colors i want to paint so the very first painting i made was on mydeathbed it was not just an art piece or not just mypassion it was my therapy what an amazing therapy it was without saying a single word i could paintmy heart out i could share my story people used to come and say wow whata lovely painting so much color nobody sees the grief in it only i could so that s how i spend my two and a halfmonths in the hospital lying never complaining or whining but painting and then i was discharged and i went back home and i realized that i have developed a lotof pressure ulcers on my back on my hipbone i was unable to sit there were a lot of infections all over mybody a lot of allergies so doctor wanted me to lie down on the bedstraight for not six months for not year but fortwo years i was bedridden confined in that one room looking outside the window listeningto the birds chirping and thinking there will be a time when we will be going out with thefamily and enjoying the nature that was the time where i realized how luckypeople are but they don t realize that is the time where i realized the dayi going to sit i am going to share this pain to make them realize how blessed they areand they even don t consider them lucky there are always turning points in your life there was a rebirthday that i celebrated after two years and two and a half monthswhen i was able to sit in a wheelchair that was the day where i had the rebirth i was a completely different person i still remember the day i sat on the wheelchairfirst time knowing that i am never going to live this knowing that i am never going towalk for the rest of my life i saw myself in the mirror and i talked tomy self and i still remember what i said i cannot wait for a miracle to come and makeme walk i cannot sit in the corner of the room cryingcripping and begging mercy because nobody has time so i have to accept my self the way i amthe sooner the better so i applied the lip color for the firsttime and i erased it and i cried and i said whatam i doing a person on a wheelchair should not do this what will people say clean it up put it back again this time i put it to myself because i want to feel perfect from within and that day i decided i am going to a lifeof myself i am not going to be that perfect person forsomeone i am just going to take this moment and iwill make it perfect for myself and do you know how we all begin that day i decided i am going to fight myfears we all have fears fear of the unknown fear of known fear of losing people fear of losing health money we want to excel in a career we want to become famous we want to get money we are scared all the time so i wrote down one by one all those fears and i decided i am going to overcome thosefears one at a time you know what was my biggest fear divorce i couldn t stand this word i was trying to cling on this person who didn twant me anymore but i said no i have to make it work but the day i decided that this is nothingbut my fear i liberated myself by setting him free and i made myself emotionally so strong thatthe day i got news that he is getting married i sent him a text and said i am so happyfor you and wanna wish you all the best and he knows that i pray for him today my biggest fear number two was i won t beable to be a mother again and that was quite devastating for me but then i realize there are so many childrenin the world all they want is the acceptance so there is no point of crying just go andadopt one that s what i did i gave my name to different organizationsdifferent orphanages i didn t mention i am on the wheelchairdying to have a child so i told then this is muniba mazari and shewants to adopt boygirl what so ever but i want to adopt and i waited patiently two years later i got this call from a verysmall city in pakistan they said are you muniba mazari there is a baby boy would you like to adopt and when i said yes i could literallyfeel the labor pain yes yes i am going to adopt him i am coming to take him home and when i reached there the man was sittingthere and he was looking at me from head to toe don t judge me i am in a wheelchair you know what he said i know you willbe the best mother of this child you both will be lucky to have each other and that day he was two days old and todayhe is six you will be surprised to know the bigger fearthat i had in me it was facing people i used to hide from people when i was in bed for two years and i usedto keep the doors closed i used to pretend that i am not going to meetanyone tell them i am sleeping you know why because i couldn t stand that sympathy thatthey had for me they used to treat me like a patient when i used to smile look at me and said you are smiling are you ok i was tired of this question being asked are you sick well a lady at the airport asked me areyou sick and i said well besides this spinal cordinjury i am fine i guess those were really cute questions they never used to feel cute when i was onthe bed so i used to hide from people knowing thatoh my god i am not going to see that sympathy on their eyes it s all right today i am here speaking to all these amazingpeople because i have overcome the fear you know when you ended up being in the wheelchairwhat s the most painful thing that s another fear people on the wheelchair who are differentlyable to have their hearts but they never share i will share that with you the lack of acceptance people think that they will not be acceptedby the people because we and the world of perfect people are imperfects so i decided instead of starting an ingongo for disabilities awareness which i know will not help anyone i started to appearmore in public i started to paint i always wanted to i have a lot of exhibitions for pakistani have done a lot of modeling campaign different campaign for brands like tony and guy i have done some really funny breaking thebarriers kinds of modelings there was this one by the name clown townwhere i became a clown because i know that clowns have a heart too so when you accept yourself the way youare the world recognizes you it all starts from within i became the national goodwill ambassadorof un women pakistan and now i speak for the rights of women andchildren we talk about inclusion diversity genderequality which is a must i was featured in bbc women for one of the forbes under for and it all didn t happen alone you all are thriving in your careers you have bigger dreams and aspirations inlife always remember one thing on the road tosuccess there is always we not me do not think that you alone can achieve things no there is always another person who isstanding behind you maybe not coming on the forefront behind you supporting you never lose that person never no matter how much i say that i couldn tfind a hero so i became one i still want to recognize those three peoplein my life who literally changed my life completely and i get inspiration from them every singleday the women who believe in me even when i wascompletely on the verge of dispare where everybody left she was there and every time i looked at her saying she used to look at me and said it s toosell pass god has a bigger plan one day you will say that oh my god thatis why god has chosen me she never cried in front of me she always said that there will be hatersthere will be naysayers there will be disbelievers and there will be you to proving them wrong my mother whatever i am today i am nothing withouther i am nothing without her thank you mama i wish you were here thank you for making me who i am today you know what we human being have a problem we always expect each from lives we have this amazing fantasy about life this is how things should work this is my plan it should go as per my plan if that doesn t happen we give up so my dear friends let me tell you one thing i never wanted to be in a wheelchair never thought of being in a wheelchair i was always aspiring to do bigger things and i had no idea for that i have to paythe price to be where i am today it s a very heavy price this life is a test and a trial tests are trials i never supposed to be easy and why you areexpecting each from lives and life gives you the lemon and you madethe lemonade and then do not blame for life for that because you were expecting each from a trial trial make you a stronger better person life is a trial every time you realize that it is ok to be scared it is ok to cry everything is ok but giving up is not bean option should not be an option they always say that failure is not an option failure should be an option when you fail you get up and then you failthen you get up that keeps you going that s how humans are strong a failure is an option it should be an option but giving up is not never we have these things in minds we call it perfection we want everything perfect we want our self to be perfect perfect life perfect relationships perfectcareer perfect amount of money that we need to earn no matter what nothing is perfect in this world we all are perfectly imperfect and that is perfectly alright that s alright you were sent here not to become perfect people those people who tell you how to look perfecteven those people are imperfect trying to fight this fear of looking imperfect i used to be perfect i still remember i got this complements yearsago when i used to walk omg look at you you are so fair you aretall you are perfect look at me now only the perfect eyes can see that only the perfect eyes will see that only the perfect eyes will see that so yes and all those imperfections you have to listento your hearts you don t have to look good for people you don t have to be perfect just becauseother people wanted you to be perfect if your soul is perfect from within that s all right this is all that you want this is all that you need to be our society has made a very weird very weirdkind of norms to look perfect in grade for a man it s different for a woman it s different we think too much about what people say we listen to ourselves too little you know what makes you perfect when you make someone smile you know what makes you perfect when you tryto do something good for the people around you you know what makes you perfect when you feel someone s pain and how beautiful pain is that it connectswith people no other medium can connect you other butpain that s why i always say i am in pain that s a blessing for me today just because i am in pain and i amon the wheelchair i work for children being the head of csrf of company we conductmedical camps in farflung areas of pakistan where so many kids died because there theydon t have medical facilities and i personally believe that just becausethey cannot afford to live doesn t mean that we will let them die so we give them money we give them medicaltreatment we try to heal their wounds physical and emotional and i also work for the beautiful people wecall them third gender the transgender community of pakistan you know what connects me with them all my imperfections when i go and hug them they never judge meand this very good friend of mine her name is bijli bijli means electricity she called herself electricity and i said are you electricity she says no i am lighting i am as strong as lightning i am thunder i am lightning she came to me and the first time i hugged she said you are justlike me and i said i am like you because to people we are so imperfect so how beautiful these imperfections are because of these imperfections you can connectto people then why are we all running after being perfect what s the point every time i go in public i smile and people asked me don t you get tiredof smiling all the time what s the secret i always say one thing i have stopped worrying about the things thati have lost people i have lost things and people who were meant to be withme are with me and sometimes somebody s absence makes youa better person cherish their absence it always a blessing i always say that people are so lucky thateven they don t realize you must be thinking ok you are lucky in that sense well the breath you just took now was a blessing embraces it there are so many people in the world whoare dreaming to live a life that you are living right now you have no idea embraces each and every breath you are taking celebrate your life live it don t die before your death we all die we live this one routine of the day for years and we call it life no that s not life if you are still thinking about why you havebeen sent here if you are still juggling with the conceptof why you are here you haven t lived yet you work hard you make money you do it for yourself that s not life you go out and seek for people who need yourhelp you make their lives better you add colors to their lives you add valuesto their lives you become that sponge which removes all negativity you can become that person who can emit beautifulpositive vibes and when you realize that you have changed someone s life and because of you this person didn t giveup that is the day when you live always we were talking about gratitude why i smile all the time i cry all night when nobody sees me because i am a human and i have to keep thebalance and i smiled all day because i know that ifi smile i can make people smile that keeps me going be grateful what you have and you will always always always ended upwith having more but if you will cry if you will crip forthe little things that you don t have or the things you have lost you will never ever have enough sometimes we are too busy thinking about thethings that we don t have forget cherish the blessings that we have i am not saying that i am not healthy thatmakes me unlucky but yes it is hard it is hard when i say i can t walk it s hard when i say i have to wear that bag it hurts but i have to keep going because never giving up is the way to live always so well end my talk on a very short note live your life fully accept the way you are be kind to yourself be kind to yourself i will repeat be kind to yourself and then only we can be kind to others love your self spread that love life will be hard there will be turmoil there will be trials but that will only make you stronger never give up the real happiness does not lie in money orsuccess or fame i have all this and i have never

denzel washingtons speech will leave you speechless one of the most eye opening speeches ever,subscribe for new motivational speeches and videos from the greatest minds every day try,youve invested a lot in your education and people have invested in you and let me tell you the world needs your talents and does it ever the world needs a lot and we need it from you we really do we need it from you young people i mean im not speaking to the rest of us up here but i know im getting a little grayer we need it from you the young people because remember this so you got to get out there you got to give it everything you got whether its your time your your your talent your prayers or your treasures because remember this music you will never see a uhaul behind a hearse ill say it again you will never see a uhaul behind a hearse you cant take it with you the egyptians tried it and all they got was robbed so the question is what are you going to do with what you have im not talking about how much you have some of you were business majors some of you are theologians nurses sociologists some of you have money some of you have patience some of you have kindness some of you have loved some of you have the gift of long suffering whatever it is whatever your gift is what are you going to do with what you have fail big thats right fail big today is the beginning of the rest of your life and it can be its going to be very frightening its a new world out there its a mean world out there and you only live once so do what you feel passionate about passionate about take chances professionally dont be afraid to fail theres an old iq test was nine dots and you had to draw five lines with a pencil within these nine dots without lifting the pencil the only way to do it was to go outside the box so dont be afraid to go outside the box dont be afraid to think outside the box dont be afraid to fail big to dream big but remember dreams without goals are just dreams music and they ultimately fuel disappointment so have dreams but have goals life goals yearly goals monthly goals daily goals i try to give myself a goal every day sometimes just to not curse somebody out simple goals but have goals and understand that to achieve these goals you must apply discipline and consistency in order to achieve your goals you must apply discipline which youve already done and consistency every day not just on tuesday and miss a few days you have to work at it every day you have to plan every day youve heard the saying we dont plan to fail we fail to plan hard work works working really hard is what successful people do and in this text tweet twerk world that youve grown up in remember just because youre doing a lot more doesnt mean youre getting a lot more done remember that just because youre doing a lot more doesnt mean youre getting a lot more done dont confuse movement with progress my mother told me yeah yeah cause you can run in place all the time and never get anywhere so continue to strive continue to have goals continue to progress i found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks nothing music nelson mandela said there is no passion to be found playing small in settling for a life thats less than the one youre capable of living now im sure in your experiences in school and applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life im sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on make sure you got something to fall back on honey but i never understood that concept having something to fall back on if im going to fall i dont want to fall back on anything except my faith i want to fall forward i figure at least this way ill see what im going to hit fall forward this is what i mean reggie jackson struck out times in his career the most in the history of baseball but you dont hear about the strikeouts people remember the home runs music fall forward thomas edison conducted one thousand failed experiments did you know that i didnt know that because the one thousand and first was the light bulb fall forward every failed experiment is one step closer to success youve got to take risks and im sure youve probably heard that before but i want to talk to you about why thats so important i got three reasons and then you can pick up your iphones first you will fail at some point in your life accept it you will lose you will embarrass yourself you will suck at something theres no doubt about it and i know thats probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony but hey im telling you embrace it because its inevitable and i should know in the acting business you fail all the time early on in my career i auditioned for a part in a broadway musical perfect role for me i thought except for the fact that i cant sing i didnt get the job but heres the thing i didnt quit i didnt fall back i walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition i prayed i prayed and i prayed but i continued to fail and fail and fail but it didnt matter because you know what theres an old saying you hang around the barber shop long enough sooner or later youre going to get a haircut so you will catch a break and i did catch a break last year i did a play called fences on broadway so someone talked about it won the tony award and i didnt have to sing by the way but heres the kicker it was at the court theater it was at the same theater that i failed that first audition years prior the point is and ill pick up the pace the point is every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed but do you have the guts to fail heres my second point about failure if you dont fail youre not even trying ill say it again if you dont fail youre not even trying my wife told me this great expression to get something you never had you have to do something you never did les browns a motivational speaker he made an analogy about this he says imagine youre on your death bed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential the ghost of the ideas you never acted on the ghost of the talents you didnt use and theyre standing around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the grave together so i ask you today how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes not only take risks but to be open to life to accept new views and to be open to new opinions to be willing to speak at a commencement at one of the best country best universities in the country even though youre scared stiff while it may be frightening it will also be rewarding because the chances you take the people you meet the people you love the faith that you have thats whats going to define you never be discouraged never hold back give everything you got and when you fall throughout life and remember this fall forward music say thank you for grace thank you for mercy thank you for understanding thank you for wisdom thank you for parents thank you for love thank you for kindness thank you for humility thank you for peace thank you for prosperity say thank you in advance for whats already yours thats how i live my life thats why i why i am one of the reasons why i am today say thank you in advance for what is already yours true desire in the heart for anything good is gods proof to you sent beforehand to indicate that its yours already say it again true desire in the heart that itch that you have whatever it is you want to do that thing that you want to do to help others and to to grow and to make money that desire that its thats gods proof to you sent beforehand already to indicate that its yours and anything you want good you can have so claim it work hard to get it when you get it reach back pull someone else up each one teach one dont just aspire to make a living aspire to make a difference you,1.0
dream motivational video,subscribe the voice you hear in this video is that of les brown,i dont know what that dream is that you have i dont care how disappointing it mightve been as youve been working toward that dream but that dream that youre holding in your mind that its possible that some of you already know that its hard its not easy its hard changing your life that in the process of working on your dreams you are going to incur in a lot of disappointment a lot of failure a lot of pain there are moments when youre gonna doubt yourself you said god why why is this happening to me im just trying to take care of my children and my mother im not trying to steal or rob from anybody how does this have to happen to me for those of you that have experience some hardships dont give up on your dream the rough times are gonna come but they have not come to stay they have come to pass greatness is not this wonderful esoteric illusive godlike feature that only the special among us will ever taste its something that truly exists in all of us its very important for you to believe that you are the one most people they raise a family they earn a living and then they died they stop growing they stop working on themselves they stop stretching they stop pushing themselves then a lot of people like to complain but they dont wanna do anything about their situation and most people dont work on their dreams why one is because of fear the fear of failure what if things dont work out and the fear of success what if they do and i cant handle it these are not risk takers you spent so much time with other people you spent some much time trying to get people to like you you know other people more than you know yourself you studied them you know about them you want hang out like them you want to be just like them and you know what youve invested so much time on them you dont know who you are i challenge you to spend time by yourself its necessary that get the losers out of your life if you want to live your dream but people who are running towards their dreams life have a special kind of meaning when you become the rightperson what you do is you start separating yourself from other people you begin to have a certain uniqueness as long as you follow on other people as long as you being a copycat you will never ever be the best copycat in the world but you will be the best you could be i challenge you to define your value that everybody wont see it that everybody wont join you that everybody wont have the vision its necessary to know that that you are an uncommon breed its necessary that you align yourself with people and attract people into your business who are hungry people who are unstoppable and unreasonable people who are rebuilding to live life just as it is and who want more the people that are living their dreams of party winners to attach themselves to the people that are living their dreams are the people that know that if its gonna happen its up to them if you want to be more successful if you want have and do stuff you never done before im asking you to invest in you to invest in you someones opinion of you does not have to become your reality that you dont have to go through life being a victim and even though you face disappointments you have to know within yourself that i can do this even if no one see it for me ive must see it for myself this is what i believe and im willing to die for it period no matter how bad it is or how bad it gets im going to make it i wanna represent an idea i wanna represent possibilities some of you right now you want to go to next level i want a council i want to be a engineer i want to be a doctor listen to me you cant get to that level you cant get to that level economically where you want to be until you start invest in your mind you are not reading books i challenge you all to go to the conference i dare you to invest tim i dare you to be alone i dare you to spent an hour to get to know yourself when you become who you are when you become the person that you are created to be designed to be who you were designed to be when you become an individual what you do is take yourself and you start separating yourself from other people im challenging you to get to the place where people do not like you or do not even bother you no more why cause you are not concerned to make them happy because you try to blow you try to the next level i need you to invest in your mind if you still taking about your dream if you still taking about your goals but you have not done anything just take the first step you can make your parent proud you can make your school proud you can touch millions of people lives and the word will never be the same again because you came this way dont let nobody steal your dream after we face a rejection and a no or we have a meeting and no one shows up or somebody said you can count on me and they dont come through what if we had that kind of attitude that cause reposses nobody believes in you you扉e lost again and again and again the lights are cut off but you still looking at your dream reviewing it every day and saying

minuteswhether it s an hour two hours take time to allow your mind separation from the stresses of your day if you expect to fail you will fail on the other hand if you expect to winyou will win and he s right because doctorsand psychologists both alike they agree that worrying actuallydoes shorten your life and it does damage your body we need to clear our thinkingbefore we go to sleep were talking about a book thatnorman vincent peal wrote the power of positive thinking let s kick this offwith golden nugget number one creating your own inner happiness that you are responsiblefor your own happiness because unhappiness is usuallythe byproduct of you thinking sad thoughts you having these negative feelings you having resentment towards others and just having an overallcrappy outlook on life so if you think those things what do you think is going to happen you have to force yourself to notthink those negative thoughts peal says we have to get intothe happiness habit by thinking upbeatcheery thoughts throughout the day we like to sit and dwell we like to sit in our own sadness i don t like to do that but i just know that sometimesmy brain forces me to do that and i don t know why so i have to force myself to not do that i have to put on upbeat music i have to do something productivei have to get in the gym i have to go hang aroundfriends that are gonna make me laugh and it s toughat first it doesn t feel right it feels like you re forcing itbecause you are forcing it but eventually it startsto make you feel better there are miracles happeningall around you there is beauty all around you open your eyes and look can you see the sun shining great can you hear the birds chirping great can you feel the warmthof the sun on your skin awesome there s simple beauties all around us if you want to start to feel happy it starts with you wanting to feel happy so short circuit those negative thoughts and when you start to feel badwhen you start to find yourself gossiping feeling guilty feeling angry feeling whatever it is you re feelingthats negative turn that around force yourself to think positively do positive things and while it doesn t feel right at first keep going you re on the right path golden nugget number two the antidote to anxiety is that people waste a lot of their timea lot of their energy fuming and fretting about thingsthat they cannot control go back to covey s principle circle of concern circle of influence focus only on those thingsin the circle of influence everything else in the circle of concernyou can t control you can t affect that so move on don t allow your mindto just spend time in that space you re wasting your mind s energy so as part of this antidote to anxiety peal says that we need to slow down to relieve our anxiety and to attain peace and he suggests meditation he suggests that we devoteat least minutes daily to calming and relaxing ourselves by thinking peaceful thoughts or not thinking anything at all so something he shares in the bookis to help get rid of the tendency to worry and get angry we need to relax and spend a few minutes thinking aboutbeautiful peaceful settings hearing the birds chirpingfeeling the sun on our face all these thingsthat i was talking about before where its just a matter of you actuallythinking that in your mind wherever you are if youre at work if youre in your house it doesnt close your eyes and open your mind to maybe a placewhere youre on vacation before and go there for minutes smell the smells feel what the sand feels like on your feet feel yourself plunging into the ocean so the antidote to anxiety its all about clearing your mind however you choose to do that make sure youre spending timeevery single day whether its minutes whether its an hour two hoursif youre working out at the gym whether youre doing yogawhether youre going to cycling class whatever take time to allow your mind separation from the stresses of your day golden nugget number three expect the best if you expect to fail you will fail on the other hand if you expect to win you will win so what seeds are you plantingin your mind are you planting seeds of positivityor seeds of negativity guess what your life is going to give you backmore of that are you planting seeds of oh doubt and oh i m not gonna make this work or something bad is gonna happen if youre planting seeds of that guess what youre gonna getmore of that start focusing on the positive start focusing on how things can go right and guess what when things go wrongsay hmm theres a lesson in that for me because life doesnt happen to meit happens for me so everything thats happening is there to teach me a lesson this isnt a setback its a set up this thing thats really badit happened for a reason im gonna learn from iti m gonna get better golden nugget number four worry not and hes right because doctorsand psychologists both alike they agree that worryingactually does shorten your life and it does damage your body we need to clear our thinkingbefore we go to sleep and we need to imagine our worries flowing out of our bodylike water out of a glass so dont think that my pathis the right path no no this path is good for me i replaced worry with hope by putting together goals i put together three goals a financial related goal a health related goal and a professional related goal something that what i was going to do with my life and back in the day wheni was going through those stresses i was worrying a lot a lot i was having a tough time sleepingi was having chest pains my heart was palpitating all the time and i really just could not get you know a high levelof satisfaction in life and you know if you were sayingon a scale of one to eight ryan again nines and tens are reserved for very special times in our livesthat seldom happen i was sitting at a four consistently where i would wake up and id all ofa sudden feel the stresses of the day id pass between three and fourall the time so what i did was to replace that worry that anxiety that fear i built myself a plan that gave me hope goals that gave me hope something that got me excited something that i wanted to work towards something i wanted to achieve because i knew that if i didit would get me out of this mess and my life would be better as a result golden nugget number five problem solving i had problems that i needed solutions to i had desires i had wants i had dreams i had goalsthat i needed a solution to the cut the crap show was a solution create your was a solution but what i did need to do was takemyself out of the busyness of the day and allow my mind to sort of free up and look for inspiration all around me and know that whatever solution i m looking forits going to come to me and this is where in this golden nugget in

much research as possible number five write down all factsabout the situation again get an understanding forthe problem whats going on you need to get clarity on the problem so you can get clear

english speech priyanka chopra be fearless english subtitles,learn english with priyanka chopra actor priyanka chopra one of indias most successful actresses who has also made a mark,thank you thank you so my father used to always tell me somethingwhich i want to share with you that why do you want to fit inside a glass slipper you know like we were told like cinderelladid why do you want to fit inside a glass slipper when you can shatter the glass ceiling i want to tell you a little secret im not very fond of this phrase breakingthe glass ceiling why does it annoy me because it takes the context of everythingthat i have done all my achievements all my hard work andputs it into a box as if my ambition was that i want to find a glass ceiling and break it not at all to be really honest i was never on a missionto break to shatter anything all i wanted was to chase my dreams my ambitions i wanted to evolve i wanted to become the best version of methat i could be and of course in priyanka chopra style alongthe way i wanted to smash and break every obstacle that came my way which i did but that does not mean that the glass ceilingdoesnt exist of course it exists and countless of women and men mostly womenrun into it in their professional and personal lives and im sure a lot of you can vouch for thatright now the oxford dictionary definition of the glassceiling is an unacknowledged barrier to advancement in a profession especially affecting womenand members of minorities from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy and this metaphor was first coined by feministsin reference to barriers in the careers of high achieving women so why did i choose it as my topic for todayif i hated it so much because i hope through my experiences i canpresent to you the tools to live your dream and to not make that glass ceiling that isdefined by society largely patriarchal as your goal i want you to aim higher because you knowyou can and its honestly all i did every step of the way all i did was set ahigher standard how did i get here by being fierce by being fearless and bybeing flawed completely and utterly flawed im not perfect like none of us are so tonight im going to try and break itdown for you a little bit in a slightly different way i present the twelve sure shot sure firewaysof becoming priyanka chopra would you like that sorry i was just kidding because as millennials we dont like to betold what to do so this is a gentle nudge in the right direction presenting pcs twelve rules of becoming thebest version of yourself so here are a few of my favorites from mylist theres only one you okay because theresno one like you and i dont mean the superfluous superficialparts im talking about the core of you who youare inside your values your beliefs your flaws and once you understand who really that personis you would have taken the first step in finding your unique self and that is the best version of you who am i really most often we dont allow ourselves the abilityto dream beyond our imagination we dont allow ourselves to think about thefuture because we are afraid of change we are afraid to move away from what is familiar either that or sometimes you know we aretoo rigid to let our dreams evolve loosen up you know shake it off a littlebit change is the only constant thing in lifeand you are never too old or never too experienced to learn something new believe that you have everything already asyour brahmāstra in your will to be able to be and achieve your dreams be fearless i know i wanted to become an aeronauticalengineer what am i today im an actor im a singer im an author im a producer im an artist how did i go from becoming an engineer toall of these things i made choices the choices that i wantedfor myself so that is my rule number two let your dreamsfly give them wings be who you want to be justby being fearless now opportunities thats another importantpart of being fearless they are very funny thing these opportunitiesthey dont come very often they come far and few in between but when they do do we recognize them our job is to recognize them and make themost of them i look back on all the things that ive doneand i marvel at the opportunities that came my way miss india miss world when i was in bareli in army school my firstfilm offer my first music single the first film i actually produced there was nevera plan ever more like the universe sort of guiding me towards these opportunities all i had to do was recognize them and makesure i worked so hard that i squeezed every drop out of these opportunities this ladies and gentlemen is called drive its called ambition so no matter where you are in life rulenumber three is you have never arrived enough to explore new opportunities and theres nothing wrong with being ambitious ladies listen to me now for all of you guys who like everythingin life i dont think theres anything wrong with wanting to have the whole cake and eatit too nothing wrong i want everything i want everything and theres nothing wrong with that as long as youre not harming someone or doingsomething wrong dont be scared to want more for yourself than you ever thought you could ill give you a small example a few years ago i was shooting a film calleddon you have heard of that right so it was chosen to be shown at the berlinfilm festival berlinale and my entire team was flying for the premiere and it was very exciting time but at the same time i was invited for thefirst time to attend the grammy awards in la so now when i was doing music it was thisbig choice both the events were literally taking place one day apart in completely differenttime zones berlin and la my team and everyone around me told me noit can never happen you have to choose what is your priority and you know what i did i made some insaneconnections mumbai to london london to berlin berlin to amsterdam amsterdam to la la tomumbai in three days and i made it happen i went to both events and i looked great atboth events even though i hadnt slept it took a littlebit of extra makeup but i was fine and thats not the only time ive done it ive done it so many times over and over again why because i dont want anyone to tell me i canthave everything i want to dream of everything and ill haveeverything so rule number four be greedy be greedy for your ambitions be hungry for it dont live on someone elses benchmarks we are told so many times in our life nogirl should do this or you are elder boy in house your responsibility is this thisis who you should be who can tell you who you should be dont let anyone or any situation dictateto you who you are and who you can be i know its very much easier said than done i know that because ive done it but fightfor your dreams because no one else is going to fight for your dreams except you ive turned down so many roles opportunitiesbecause they did not fit into what i thought at that time was the right thing for me so today my path is just my own it belongs to no one my failures my successes all of it minemy journey all of it is mine so rule number five do not compromise do not settle on your dreams now who likes to fail what what at least people raised theirhands im really confused with this audience right now and you like to fail well im not talkingto you guys then im talking to those guys who hate to failbecause i hate to fail its really as simple as that it takes tubsand tubs of ice cream lots of tissues lots of tears lots of dramebazi my mother mybest friends my family everybody making me feel better about it but the one thing that is as certain as nightand day ladies and gentlemen is that you will fail its just how it is and theres nothing that you can do to stopthat its what you do after that will define whereyou go when something ive invested thank you thank you when something ive invested in my heart andmy soul which i do with everything that i actually put my mind to if that fails idont just wallow in selfpity i roll myself in it i roll around in it i wrap myself in it head to toe selfpityselfpity selfpity its not a pretty sight i can tell you that my mother whos sitting right here has witnessedit many times but then i get up cry a little dust myselfoff and dive straight back into life because the only way to push failure asideis to move ahead not ignore it analyze it and learn from it always remember you will never truly enjoysuccess until you have tasted failure and trust me when i tell you it tastes likeshit really does so rule number six fail fail fail againand then rise like a phoenix now what is life without a little bit of arisk right no im not an adrenaline junkie im not telling you to go off roller coastersor anything ive always believed that you have to takerisks calculated educated risks to evolve because if youve not truly explored the fullextent of your possibilities youll always remain stagnant people have written me off several times inmy career sometimes they didnt agree with my choices when i played a negative character in my filmaitraaz very early in my career i was told ill be a vamp and no one will cast me asa heroine when i took on a female centric film calledfashion again very early on in my career i was told that was not norm when i signed a us tv show at the height ofmy film career in india each time the risks were huge the stakes were high and the repercussionscould have been to say not the least career ending thank god they werent and im still standingin front of you i really appreciate god i dont know what will happen going forward but as of now i can say that my risks andthe gamble was worth it you know why because i backed up those risks with my hundredpercent so rule number seven be bold and take theserisks now friends family the people you workwith the people around us are our greatest influences in your journey to success so you have to choose very wisely rule number eight surround yourself withthe right people who do not stab you in the back now whos into social media whos on social media raise your hands yeah we like it i like it we can raise our hands alright its almost everyone now keep your hands raised if you have everbeen upset by like a bad comment that you may have read on a photograph or like on facebookor when you have posted something and sometimes you know you are just likewhy do people have to be mean yeah so theres a lot of you right guys please let me just tell you this no matter what you do someone will alwaysbe unhappy always especially in this age of social media itsso easy for us to be confused between the voices that actually matter and the opinionsof faceless people writing behind the anonymity of what the web offers they dont matter so rule number nine you can never pleaseeveryone all the time and the biggest favour that you will all doto yourselves will be to laugh at yourself at situations find a moment to appreciate every single daythis funny thing called life and thats my most important rule number tendont take yourself too seriously were not making rockets alright calm down have fun and just enjoy this beautiful journey thatweve been put on i do that in the meanwhile hi i am here not going anywhere two rules arestill left its really not that hard in my experienceto be kind to be compassionate to be human you will never know someone elses full story so dont be quick to judge my mother whos here tonight with the restof my family this entire front row is very chopra and akhori right now she taught me when i was very very youngthat there is always someone who will be less fortunate than you always so give back wherever you can theres a huge reason i started my foundationi lend my voice to unicef girl up and causes that im associated with because we haveone world and its ours and we need to heal it and that starts with us so that is my rule number eleven give back and finally the most important one alwaysremember where you came from its truly what defines you so im a proud indian and armys daughter daughter of two doctors with a middleclassupbringing and ginormous families who i love on both sides weve seen good times weve seen bad times weve seen hardships weve seen pain laughtersadness but that is what has made me who i am and i wear that with pride every day and everywherethat i go so last and definitely not the least rulenumber twelve dont ever forget your roots and where you came from i hope you take some of what i have sharedwith you today and go into the new year with maybe a different perspective on life andstart with being fierce fearless and flawed yeah thats it thats it i read this somewhere and it kind of stuckwith me and i hope it will stick with you lifes journey is not to arrive at your gravesite safely in a wellpreserved body but rather to skid in sideways completely wornout and say holy shit that was a ride that is how i want to go so to sum up this incredible journey thati have been on i stand before you today weathered by life but happy and raring todo so much more ill see you on the other side namaste,1.0

how to stay motivated all the time sadhguru answers,sadhguru answers a question about staying motivated in life and how every human being must make the most of the brief time,music the only thing that you have to do is rise and sparkle as a fullfledged life because when youre doing wonderfully well you will do what is needed then he will not ask how do i wake up in the morning and be motivated music you should not be a motivated person generally somebody when we say somebody is motivated it means they have an agenda of their own life has no agenda its for you to be a fullfledged life a grasshopper is trying to be a full place grasshopper earthworm is trying to be a fullfledged earthworm a bird is trying to be a fullfledged bird a tree is trying to be a fullfledged tree a human being should strive to become a fullfledged human being is all our businesses but each one of us start creating our own agendas and doing all kinds of things no no youre just a piece of life dont take yourself too seriously because before you and me countless number of people have come and gone yes or no where are they all those people you think they were all idiots they were all idiots and they died is it no they were also like you maybe they were also officers maybe they were kings more than you all kinds of things all top soil now this will also become topsoil just a little bit of time life is a bit of a sparkle music how old is your son so years ago where was he sir so if somebody is not here we say they are dead isnt it years ago he was dead we will give him years years later he will be again dead yes or no yes so years ago how long was it that sir huh long time so years later or years later how long will he be dead sir very long time so all of us will be dead for a very long time theyre alive just for a brief amount of time yes very brief amount of time we will be dead for a very long time i want you to look at it in this perspective how long will you be dead you cant imagine so let us say years we are dead or years they are dead or a million years we are dead all right how long are you alive compared to that very very brief what you call as life is a brief sparkle the only thing that you have to do is rise and sparkle as a fullfledged life when something is needed around us we will do that naturally because when youre doing wonderfully well you will do what is needed isnt it when you are miserable you will be motivated just tell me when you are very happy have you looked at yourself how nice and wonderful you are youre willing to do anything for anybody bend backwards if necessary yes or no when youre little frustrated how difficult it is so dont teach your children to become motivated about something these are all nonsense thats coming from the west all those trashy selfhelp books motivate yourself build confidence believe in yourself you believed in god and destroyed so much of this world now you believe in yourself what will you do all this trash is coming from the west you dont have to be motivated you just have to see how this is alive to its fullest possible level right now if its fully alive it will do everything that it can do isnt it what it cannot do anyway it will not do if you watch a bird in the morning there are birds here you know where do you come from sir delhi maybe there are no birds at all except kaka so here if you see a bird sir little bird in the morning its doing everything that it can do isnt it hello everything that it can do it will spare nothing thats all you have to do everything that you can do what you cannot do perfectly okay a worm cannot do what a bird does a bird cannot do what an elephant does an elephant cannot do what we do yes or no but we must be doing what we can do what we cannot do it doesnt matter what we can do must happen for this all thats needed is you must understand life is a very brief sparkle its just gone yes or no before you know whats happening youll be gone unless youre miserable miserable people have a long life only they feel life is long if youre very joyful poof itll be gone before you know whats happening have you noticed a specific day youre very happy hours gone like that little miserable hours feel like years yes or no so time is a very relative experience but if you compare to how long you will be dead you will be dead for millions of years youre alive just for a few little bit this time dont be motivated by anything all that you have to do is you must become a fullfledged life year year old boy she shouldnt become a motivated human being he must just be burst of life then he will not ask how do i wake up in the morning and be motivated what are you motivated about nothing if youre alive youll bounce out of your bed isnt it but now the way we eat the way we breathe the way we do things and intoxicants and stuff everything generally the body wants to die it doesnt want to be alive people you know its all from the west people created

the power of being alone sadhguru jaggi vasudev,sadhguru talks about the importance of learning to be alone if we want togetherness to be rich and rewarding to watch this video,he said its better to walk alone than to walk with a fool if you want consciously you can evolve in this evening there is no limit as to how a human being can become this is something that every human being must do then coming together will be hugely rewarding music when gautama the buddha was asked is it better to walk alone or in company he said its better to walk alone than to walk with a fool well thats him not me he was quite sure that only a fool will walk with you so he said its better to walk alone than to walk with the fool certain lore in this country says when you want to do a short and quick journey walk alone when you want to do a long journey walk in company but the important thing is who is walking with you not always being together is a good thing many times being together can be a nuisance so first and foremost unless you are a twin even then we come along and we go along if one does not know how to be by himself or herself then being together can be a lot of nuisance we are referred to as human beings human beings means every other creature is what it is simply because of what it does music but a human being can simply be which is a unique quality of the human being that we can simply be that we are not compulsive action thats what it means our action is conscious and judicious but generally when people get together generally people are in compulsive action it can be an association where there could be a purposeful action or it can be a gang where there can be more purposeful action or it can be a crowd which can be a compulsive action so essentially to be human means we have reached that point of evolution within ourselves that if we wish we can simply sit here just be we can consider as to what action to take and what not to take this is definitely individual when individuals come together we say its we in in plural but still it is individuals who have to come together to be an individual means you are not further divisible that means youre just one people find different ways to divide themselves within themselves in india with years of cultural history we have invented various words to divide ourselves its very common for people to talk in terms of atma paramatma ankara this one and that one but every every culture has this in their own way when things are going right when good things are being done if you ask people they say yes i did it when things dont go right when things go wrong then they will try to find somebody if they dont find anybody he is always there when they are very wonderful of course they take pride in being how wonderful they are when they turn nasty they say it was my ego mr ego is always a fall guy so individual means by if im wonderful its me if im nasty its me all of you are you hours wonderful hello are you hours wonderful no no sometimes wonderful sometimes nasty sometimes beautiful sometimes ugly its okay if we understand it is me who is capable of being absolutely wonderful and it is me who is capable of being absolutely nasty another moment then gradually the number of moments of nastiness will keep on receding if i see what is wonderful is me what is nastys in india we have many words its my karma what can i do now you must fix this being an individual is very important that means youre not further divisible if im wonderful its me if im nasty its me if i succeed its me if i fail its me you have to fix this im just asking you a simple question within this how many people hello how many people within you one two only one if youre one your normal human being if youre more than one youre either schizophrenic or youre possessed you either neither need a psychiatrist or an exorcist but you will see whenever things dont go right another guy will pop up from somewhere so becoming an individual means you killed all those popups and just said this is me this what is me has many dimensions if i dont see this is an individual i cannot divide this further then transformation will not happen if transformation does not happen if people come together in that state there will be more mess than solutions all creatures hang out together whether it is various wild creatures most of them hang out together even monkeys who are just one step behind us they are also in bunches it is only human being who can sit alone and transform himself or herself because this is the prerogative of being human that we can simply be this is why youre called human being youre capable of being youre not in a compulsive state of activity if you want consciously you can evolve in this evening you can evolve if youre willing it doesnt take a million years because our evolution is not biological anymore our evolution is conscious for every other creature it is fixed nature has fixed two lines within which every other creature lives and goes but once you have come as a human being there is only bottom line there is no top line there is no limit as to how a human being can become so before we associate ourselves with people itll be good every day in the morning or a certain period of your life if one withdraws to spend a little time with oneself and see how in what ways can this be little better than the way it was yesterday this life how it can be a little better life than what it was yesterday because most people are coming together for their needs to fulfill needs people come together some people come together to fulfill a purpose or a course some people come together to eat drink and be together because they cannot be alone this is something that every human being must do a certain period of time you do one thing just hours take a break from everything not today right now youre among people you take a break sometime just hours and dont read dont watch television dont use a phone simply sit in your room alert not sleeping and if you watch the nature of your mind you yourself will certify this is a madman because for most people their mind cannot stay on any one thing unless theyre in activity simply they cannot be here in compulsive state of psychological activity is on when you are like this you cannot be that means you cannot be a human being being has to happen only then togetherness will be very rich if you know how to be by yourself then coming together will be hugely rewarding and of tremendous value that means we came together consciously music

english speech justin trudeau we re all the same english subtitles,learn english with justin trudeau canadian prime minister justin trudeau gave students a new definition of bravery trudeaus,i have to say to be here now speaking with all of you in yankee stadium one of the greatest places in one of the greatest cities on earth is more than a little humbling my friends you are now nyu graduates the best and the brightest you have great potential and possibilities and therefore you have enormous responsibility too so today i d like to talk about the nature of both those things and i d like to offer you a challenge one that i think is essential for your future success as individuals and as the leaders that you are becoming among the many things i admire about nyu is that about a fifth of the students are international and a similar proportion are the very first in their families to go to college this group is truly diverse in every possible way and i think that is an extraordinarily valuable and important thing when i graduated in the early s i went on a trip around the world with a few good friends who actually remain good friends to this day which is sort of a miracle we trekked and traveled mostly over land from europe to africa to asia and that remains one of the great formative experiences of my life it was an amazing adventure it was also a really important contributor to my continued broader education because it forced me really for the first time as an adult to meet engage befriend people whose views and experiences ideas values and language were very different from my own when a kid from montreal meets a korean fisherman living in mauritania befriends a russian veteran of their afghan war or a shopkeeper and his family living in danang interesting conversations always happen now maybe some of you have talked about doing something like a great trip like that after graduation but i d be willing to bet one of the first things you heard was a warning you can t do that in this day and age it s not safe but here s my question is it really just the issue of physical safety that makes our loved ones so anxious at the idea of us getting out there or is it the threat that if we look past our frames the frames of our own lives of our own community s structured values and belief systems to truly engage with people who believe fundamentally different things we could perhaps be transformed into someone new and unfamiliar to those who know and love us see there s no question that today s world is more complex than it was in the mids there are serious and important problems that we are grappling with and will continue to grapple with but we are not going to arrive at mutual respect which is where we solve common problems if we cocoon ourselves in an ideological social or intellectual bubble now we can see it all around us there s a peculiar fascination with dystopia in our culture today you see it everywhere on film and tv but the truth is that on balance we have the good fortune to live in a time of tremendous possibility and potential a time when it is within our grasp to eliminate extreme poverty to end terrible diseases like malaria and tb and to offer a real chance at an education to everyone on this planet but for us to move forward to keep moving and moving forward we have to do it together all together humanity has to fight our tribal mindset we go to the same church cool you re in my tribe you speak my language you re in my tribe you re an nyu alumni you re in my tribe you play pokémon go you re a vegetarian you like the yankees you go to the gun range you re prochoice tribe tribe tribe see but of course its not the belonging part that is the problem it s the corollary you are part of my tribe and they are not whether it s race gender language sexual orientation religious or ethnic origin or our beliefs and values themselves diversity doesn t have to be a weakness it can be our greatest strength now often people talk about striving for tolerance now don t get me wrong there are places in this world where a little more tolerance would go a long way but if we re being honest right here right now i think we can aim a little higher than mere tolerance think about it saying i tolerate you actually means something like ok i grudgingly admit that you have a right to exist just don t get in my face about it and oh don t date my sister there s not a religion in the world that asks you to tolerate thy neighbor so let s try for something a little more like acceptance respect friendship and yes even love and why does this matter because in our aspiration to relevance in our love for our families in our desire to contribute to make this world a better place despite our differences we are all the same and when you meet and befriend someone from another country or another culture who speaks a different language or who worships differently you quickly realize this and here s my main point and the challenge i m offering you today our celebration of difference needs to extend to differences of values and belief too diversity includes political and cultural diversity it includes a diversity of perspectives and approaches to solving problems see it s far too easy with social media shaping our interactions to engage only with people with whom we already agree members of our tribe well this world is and must be bigger than that so here is my request as you go forward from this place i would like you to make a point of reaching out to people whose beliefs and values differ from your own i would like you to listen to them truly listen and try to understand them and find that common ground you have a world of opportunity at your fingertips but as you go forward from here understand that just around the corner a whole different order of learning awaits in which your teachers will come from every station in life every education level every belief system every lifestyle and i hope you will embrace that you have been students you will continue to learn all your lives but now it is also time for you to become leaders in every generation leaders emerge because they one day awake to the realization that it s not up to someone else to fix this problem or take up that cause it s up to them so now is the time for you to lead leaders now i m sure that s a word that s been tossed around you and at you quite a bit over the past few hours days weeks and years leaders of tomorrow leaders of today but what does it mean what attributes does a st century leader need to have what do people need most from their leaders today and tomorrow now i think you need to be brave really brave and i know when you think of courageous leaders you think of those folks who stood implacably and fearlessly anchored in their sense of rightness willing to pit their ideals against all comers against the slings and arrows aimed their way well i don t think that s brave enough i don t think that s good enough for what our shared future will ask of you i actually don t think it s ever been good enough leadership has always been about getting people to act in common cause we re going to build a new country we re going to war we re going to the moon it usually required convincing or coercing a specific group to follow you and the easiest way to do that has always been through tribal contrasts they believe in a different god they speak a different language they don t want the same things as we do but the leadership we need most today and in the years to come is leadership that brings people together that brings diversity to a common cause this is the antithesis of the polarization the aggressive nationalism the identity politics that have grown so common of late it s harder of course it s always been easier to divide than unite but mostly it requires true courage because if you want to bring people around to your way of thinking you need to first show them that you are open to theirs that you are willing to enter into a conversation that might change your mind show respect for their point of view and you have a better chance of actually having them listen to yours and regardless of what happens you will have had a genuine exchange that focused on understanding not on winning a debate or scoring points and you will both be improved for it let me be very clear this is not an endorsement of moral relativism or a declaration that all points of view are valid female genital mutilation is wrong no matter how many generations have practiced it anthropogenic climate change is real no matter how much some folks want to deny it but here s the question do you want to win an argument and feel good about how superior you are or do you actually want to change behaviors and beliefs see it s been pointed out that one of the many differences between abraham lincoln and jefferson davis was that davis preferred to win a debate while lincoln would rather win the war and that s the question do you want to win an argument or do you want to change the world with malice toward none and charity toward all let those words of this country s greatest president guide your ambitions your hopes for yourselves your families your country your planet there is no shortage of cynicism and selfishness in the world be their answer their antidote i am abundantly optimistic about the future because of you it is yours to make and mold and shape the world eagerly awaits indeed requires your ideas your initiative your enterprise your energy your passion and compassion your idealism and your ambition but remember that true courage is the essential ingredient in all your efforts congratulations class of now go change the world merci,1.0
they said girls are waste of money priyanka chopra motivation english speech winner girls,priyanka chopra jonas is an indian actress model and singer she gave a bold speech at the event organized by variety,music so in life you know there are moments when you stop and ask yourself how did i get here like why am i standing here well this is definitely one of those moments for me and i find myself going back to the beginning back to my roots i was born to incredible parents amazing parents who served as doctors in the indian army i was the first born and as far back as i can remember i made my parents very proud and happy of the time okay slight exaggerations of personal achievements are allowed from time to time dont you think my brother was born a few years later and even then nothing changed for me we were both given equal opportunities and i want to emphasize this i want to really emphasize this for you because i dont think a lot of people might understand that being equal might seem very normal but where i come from india and a lot of developing countries around the world more often than not this is an exception its actually a privilege my first experience of the glaring disparity between boys and girls came at a very very young age i grew up in a middle class family with extremely philanthropic parents who constantly reminded me and my brother how lucky we were and how giving back to those who were less fortunate was not a choice it was a way of life simple i was seven or eight years old when my parents started taking me on these visits in a traveling clinic to developing communities around and villages around the city that we lived in called we were packed into this ambulance and my parents would provide free medical care to people who couldnt afford it my job at the age of eight was assistant so i would count all the medicines put them in an envelope and give it out to patients and i really took my job very seriously very seriously but the more i went on these expeditions the more i began to notice the simplest things that distinguished a boy from a girl or a man from a woman for example girls were pulled out of school when they hit puberty because they were considered ready for marriage and babies thats and while boys still enjoyed their childhood our basic human rights such as healthcare were denied just because they were women let this lets call this whole experience trigger number one for me fast forward a few years and many many triggers in between like a producer director for example early on in my career i must have been about or telling me that if i didnt agree to the ridiculous terms or painfully low salary in his movie that he would just replace me because girls are replaceable in the entertainment business that was a memorable one made me decide to make myself irreplaceable but i think what really moved the needle for me and ultimately led me to create the priyanka chopra foundation for health and education and around the same time partner with unicef was an encounter with my housekeepers daughter about years ago i came home from set early one day and she was sitting in my library reading a book and she must have been eight or nine years old and i knew she loved reading so i asked her i was like this is i mean its a weekday why arent you in school and she said oh i dont go to school anymore so i went and asked her mother and i said you know why isnt she in school and her mom said that her family couldnt afford to send her and her brothers to school so they chose the boys the reason she would eventually get married and it would be a waste of money i was completely blown and it shook me to my core eventually i decided to cover the cost of her education so that she could continue to learn because education is a basic human right applause and a huge necessity especially today from that point on i was determined to make a difference in as many childrens lives as i could in whatever big or small way that i could contribute theres a really really beautiful quote that i read recently and i think its absolutely appropriate to say to explain what im trying to say today the hand that rocks the cradle the procreator the mother of tomorrow a woman shapes the destiny of civilization such is the tragic irony of fate that a beautiful creation such as a girl child is today one of the greatest concerns facing humanity girls have the power to change the world it is a fact and yet today girls are more likely than boys never to set foot in a classroom despite of all the efforts and progress made over the last two decades more than im just going to give you a stat more than million girls of primary school age will never learn how to read or write compared to million boys primary school its the beginning of our future over the last years i have witnessed first hand the incredible work that unicef does for children around the world especially victims and survivors of child marriage displacement war sexual violence but there is still so much work to do and for me that is the fuel to my fire the reason i am so committed to this cause and that is where my passion stems from because i know that a girls education not just empowers families but communities and economies a result of her education we all do better its just as simple as that as entertainers and influencers sitting in this room i feel that its our social responsibility to be a voice for the voiceless which is why i applaud each and every woman in this room for being such a badass music for

jack mas life advice will change your life must watch,if you are struggling or having a hard time consider taking an online therapy session with our partner betterhelp,so years old dont worry any mistake is that income is a wonderful revenue for you so i tell myself and told my young people before years old be a good student where do intrapreneur just to learn some experience before years old follow somebody go to a small company normally in a big company it is good to learn processing you are a part of a big machine but when you go to small company you learn the passion you learn the dreams you learn how to do a lot of things at one time so before years old its not which company you goits which boss you follow its very important a good boss teach you differently and before from to years old you have to think very clearly were you working for yourself if you really want to be interpreted when youre to years old you have to do all the things that you are good at dont try to drop into the new area its too late you may be successful but the rate of dying is too big so to think about how can focus on things that you are good at but when you are to years old work for the young people because young people can do better than you so rely on them invest on them making sure theyre good so when you s over or so spend time for yourself on the beach sunshine right its too late way to change normally but i visit by by a device to the young people twentyfive years old make enough mistakes dont worry you fall you stand up you fall your step enjoy it im its only five years oh it enjoyed the show in do it i didnt have a rich father tried three times for university all filled i apply for however for ten times all filled theyd only want to see me for the last time i went to the teachers college which was considered the third or four class of my fitting to apply jobs of thirty times ill reject it it was so difficult at that time i was so frustrated because i taught in the university my pain was ten dollars a month because i could not find a good job in foot discussed that im going to do something called internet and of them i guess that they said this is stupid idea we have never heard by the internet and you know nothing about computer and i never thought i was smart nobody believed that i could be successful because everybody said well this guy thinks differently singer crazily you know they think about something never worked i try to borrow us daughter from the banks took me three months but i still cannot get it we talked over or venture capitalists everybody said no forget it a lot of people said alibaba is a terrible model as i said i believe it i think this thing could be big i never thought you will be that big like today i believe that something something is waiting for me there and i have to work hard to prove myself that was the tough experience so we gather us dollars from fighters we started for the first three years we do not have even one dollar revenue from our business whats not easy why it keeps the going ahead going forward because i received lots of email of thanks from the customers they say this is such a great thing we cannot obtain you but this things helped us if you keep on helping us one day you will be successful and i believe this little by little we build up our business little by little were good about ecosystem of the infrastructure and now after years we have a alibaba group who have a team or group we have a tarball group where we pay and people said you are so smart how could you make a company like that bill gates warren buffet the jack welch very page mark zuckerberg the difference between those people and other people they are always optimistic for the future they never complained they always tried to solve the problems of the others when youre up to mr its always opportunity people same here today jeff where is the opportunity i dont have a job i dont have this i dont have a debt we are at them back to time of the century the best assets you have is that you are young dont complain let the other people complain the opportunity lie always lies where people complain think about how you can make things different is there anything i can do that make the difference and then when you think about this study do it i saw a lot of people young people have a fantastic ideas every evening but in the morning they go to the opposite again being entrepreneur you have to do the things before the other people do you have to wake up before the other people wake up you have to be more brave than the others use your instinct everything you do is to the need of the customer to everybody to any person tomorrow is new make the move make the action whether investors believe it is or not whether your friends believe it or not whether your parents believe it or not thats not important you believe it your team believe it and work day and night on this thats how the things happens make enough mistakes you fall you stand up any mistake is that income is a wonderful revenue dont worry about the money money follow the people people should follow the dreams if you have a dream just to go ahead i think nobody can conquer the world we only can serve the world either work for the others or work for yourself and i choose the way work might for myself working for myself that means working for the society if you really want to work with yourself think about the others because only when the other people are successful when the other people are happy youll be successful you will be happy i think today people worry a lot about the world about the economy china economy in the world and im a very optimistic when people start to worry that that is the opportunity is but i worry about the blood testing and she created good things and i think great innovations great companys always happening in the tough times lives like the music you have a pivot down you have a longer shot nodes and i like the american movie life life is like a box of chocolate you never know what youre going to get right so im pretty optimistic the opportunity in the future for equality is huge because in the in in the last century the it is for big companies the globalization is for big companies but now with the technology we can serve those of the companies that never been served we can serve the of the young people that never serve technology for internet is so cheap so easy to use one of the reasons why we grow in china ecommerce so fast much faster than the us because our infrastructure of commerce in china was too bad why it is too bad something happening goes today we are working on the rural areas of china i can never imagine that china but million people still live in the rural areas of farmers and theyre about close to million people they are incomes less than one dollar per day and before the internet its impossible for these guys to reach the pc because its so difficult even people like me i dont know how to use in pc but now stand up the farmers those will be using mobile phones when have the mobile phones the internet the data things change it a lot so im excited about the future people always worry thats the you know i love the young kids sitting there and talking about the dream their hopes because if they have the hope we have the hope thats what i believe and lets just take what you do and i loved every description ive ever heard you about how you serve people and your story about the bamboo farmers and your wife and her friends its tagless but wheres this going what are you going to do what are your plans to maximize the use that people in remote rural areas of china can make of their cell phones besides ordering your projects how are you going to get it are you going to get them in the banking system through cell phones how well we we never know that we cant grow so fast the path to five miles we covered villages and these people not only they a using very traditional way that it takes them like two of we went to the rural area it took them the farmers two hours to work to the downtown in in the middle of the town and buy things but today because the mobile phone and we deliver we can deliver things to their home to their village within hours i remember theres a well last week i read a very interesting if this is chant amazing there is a girl she told me a story she said her grandfather years old birthday and for his life he always wanted to try one westernstyle food but he lived in the rural areas theres no such restaurant food so she said i tried on the internet booked a restaurant dinner for western food delivered to that village and finally immediately find one restaurant there are three guys they took like a threeday bus from the from shanghai to that village made a italian spaghetti and beef for them for the years old birthday and whole village was excited everybody says wow you can order food west westernstyle food so you can buy almost everything and also we are helping there a lot of farmers they plant love apples great apples but of the apples route it because theres nobody by allah they normally buy by track you know if you sell the the apples this our whole track and using a traditional way they can they can sell by whole basket of the apples but now because of the internet the sell by one by one each apple to sell o in a or for each so the farmers of the using internet they can buy and sell using a mobile phone that change their lives and i think its exciting and people need examples when they see well the other my neighbors maker made money through online to selling things my neighbor made you know by much interesting things online people start to learn and more people started by the mobile phones we cannot have we cannot make all the factory the mobile factories to sell phones to them only they know the mobile phone really works helping change their lives is to divide mobile phones just one more question and then do you think this will make the current problems like a current problem in china less likely that is if well have more market information in the market will drive where the investment goes instead of the government trying to make judgments about i better build another housing development or office development here there yonder and you wind up with a bubble well it comes from the bottom up is it more likely that fewer bad things will happen yeah they know i think the last week i was in seattle discussing about the china ah nummy i think the you american people worry too much about the china economy well you see every time where you start to worry about the china china goes better every time you think chinese are in problem you know were good you know well get better but we never say however you have a high expectation er trying to always a problem like a parents of the expectation of the kids you know at the same but theres a big difference between the american consumption because people say wow you know the economy is bad so china consumption will be good look no totally different you american love to spend it tomorrows money and the other peoples money maybe all maybe the kudus money we chinese love to save money we are probably the largest country under the safe deposit in the whole world that will people because weve been poor for so many years when we meet money were put in the banks because sunday we know the disaster is coming so we can spend the money so when the economys bad we still have the money to spend you guys probably dont you worried and the second thing is the china being if marketing china being focusing on developing for path to years china government so strong on investment so strong on exporting but they are too weak on the domestic consumption domestic consumption is not driven by governments driven by entrepreneurship driven by the market not the government so in the past two years past years government is so strong now they get a week its our opportunity its our show time to see the market economy entrepreneurship how we can develop the real consumption i think were if the china developed a great consumption we have a million middle class in next to years were going to have been a middle class we need to import a lot so when we start to import thats a great its going to i worry a lot when we act when we export weve got a terrible sky we have a terrible water we have a terrible environment when we start import we got to be better so thats all the great opportunity guys be happy about that im serious were that serious im them we worry about yourself dont worry the reason some of them to worry about china is we depend on you to buy our debt however i tried to be more chinese when i was president i saved a lot of money so good but i just wanted you to say that because i really believe that i mean i think youre absolutely right the trend toward greater internal consumption is i think will remain unbroken in spite of whatever the difficulties are in the next few months i think its important not to over react you cant break the trend youve got to clean up the land from chemical contaminants youve got to clean up the air youre going to do it and a lot of chinese will make a lot of money out of that therell be a lot of great new companies and theyll be opportunities to import from other places yes so can you discuss your theory of what youre doing and other things in terms of whether it advances equal opportunity and social solidarity tell them what you think is going to happen and what other kinds of when your opening remarks you just said technology is going to be active in this way in other areas of the economy what do you think the next big opportunities are but first tell them just in two sentences what youre doing because jack and i know and we havent been clear enough explain it and explain how you think that advances social solidarity and equality of opportunity our work is in the belief that access to health information is a basic human right and that lab information particularly because lab data drives seventy percent of clinical decisions im needs to be accessible to people before theyre sick so if you look at the word diagnosed in the dictionary today it says to determine the presence of disease from symptoms which means by definition were determining that people are sick once a disease has already progressed and our work is in being able to make lab testing accessible to people in time for therapy to be effected and to do that in a way in which every person irrespective of their insurance status irrespective of where they live can afford the ability to get a test done so that means in our case weve invested the last years in now developing hundreds of tests many of which are less than ten dollars so in two dollar tests in the united states and i think one of the amazing things about this country is that we have such an incredible ecosystem for fueling creativity and that creativity can create new markets so it answered your question about the market being able to conform itself to social good i think the creativity that goes into creating these new technologies creates new markets in and of themselves and and our basic belief that is that those new markets come from empowering individuals and in franchising individuals and trusting that individuals have the capability to engage with information and in accessing that information beginning to take control of their own outcomes and their own health outcomes and in doing so changing the way our healthcare system works i think what this could mean for rural china you know for rural india for native american reservations in america for the mississippi delta for the remote areas where all the jobs were lost from culture all of a sudden giving people information and one of the most important things i think we did and my second term as president and healthcare fund was developed as diabetes selfcare program and all of a sudden you could be jacks company could be delivering the means to selfcare based on your test i mean i think that this is really this is a very big deal we all want to live as long as well as we can and gregg benner was here we were joking about whether wed make it to a hundred but in the meanwhile do you want to keep people healthy and if theyre sick you want to intervene early not late yeah well and if you look at i mean the ability to engage with its information we have a four trillion dollar health care problem in this country of it is type diabetes which is reversible and we have million americans who do not know they are prediabetic but access to information and the ability to engage with that information is the foundation for being able to change those outcomes and and cost right one more factor than i want to call in jack you founded this company twelve years ago right tell them how old we were i was so dont worry about the future were in good hands okay i always think of a where i am have not the past examination for university yet i filled a free times but i think it were done im not a good of schooling well yeah thats why i give confidence to a lot of young people in china if jackie markhams success can be successful of that people can be successful people like her are jealous well equality i i would like to make a little bit cut technology helping because yesterday i was joining the united un women conference about gender equality and i think the first a technology revolution happened years ago in the uk release the human body their arms stronger the second technology revolution in the usa for energy you can last long but this technology of revolution relief release the brain so this century is not a competition who is strong whose muscles are stronger this who is a smarter who is up who can listen you its the challenge of a wisdom so men women equal on the internet you can never see hes a woman a man and on the internet women can serve much better than men on the internet and a man talking about a business talking about you know numbers competition to make business very cold women they make business very cozy lifestyle and interesting more than of our shop owners want to have five million shop owners of women and people looked at me this is this is a great thing i see that this century we see more and more women leaders on the state leaders the presidents and in the future were going to general scepter of your nation shall be a woman leader and this is the greatest century for equality and i feel excited about that when they ask you im were almost out of time but i one of the things that we havent talked enough about here and i just hear but generally is whether the leap frogging we saw with cell phones which was instrumental in your phenomenal business success and which will make it possible for you at the appropriate time to do what youve done on a global scale into unimaginable in all of human history for anybody to have any of their own health data we havent we seen examples but not the kind of dramatic penetration we need with energy and clean energy and enough and its short enough time to avoid the worst consequences of climate change so do you believe that i mean your country has done more than anybody else to try to put up solar panels and some of your companies when it broke because you overdid it right beforehand and you got to work out the phaseout of the coal the phasing in the sun and all that meanwhile africa which is growing like crazy because of the cell phone in no small measure and as six of the fastest growing countries in the world still has vast swathes of its land totally dark at night do you believe that its possible for us to scale up with distributed solar power is rather than centralized as quick as we did with a cell phone and if so and if that were your business if you had to quit what youre doing today and start there how would you do it and how would you do it at first i know that you know im such a huge believer in technology and i think especially right now were at an incredible time in terms of new technology and the ability to apply technology in a scalable way towards solving some of these problems so i would look at it in the context of some of the renewable solutions that we already have and in the context of empowering connecting individuals with access to those solutions in the context of creating markets around them i think that theres real opportunity to actually create an ecosystem in which people can financially benefit from these solutions and i think thats going to drive an adoption i think in developing economies theres a revenue stream associated with that and the more we can turn even already some of the technologies that we have into markets the more that we can fuel i believe local growth and individual engagement in in beginning to adopt some of these solutions just related it would be jack you answer and then ill ask you one final question yeah i must dont believe it the technology can make war much better because people say china economy is getting slower im happy about a even even of the gdp of the number of china the second large economy is big enough but you dont expect china keep on growing because like a one body one human body when youre meters tall you cannot keep on like a percent growth every year you have to grow the quality your mind of wisdom so i think china needs new technology to solve these problems and which today the data the the clean technology all these things that china is supposed to do if you keep on the tradition that the old ways will go nowhere but this is why i feel excited because people ask me what is your dream now because i never thought i would be today i can sit here talking to president im like a guy you know on the street and like fill the three times for university five times for high key schools i applied for times in harvard school or rejected i never thought because of the technology because the internet gives me this opportunity so i think when i retire i dont want the chinese people have a terrible water to drink and a save for food and people the money we make or spend in a hospital thats disaster so how we can using the technology to enable young people the greater chance of this world dont worry about we got billion people who are born in s they are the people of the internet times they are going to have new ways to solve the world problems the things you are worried about today because of it and a human being have these kind of worries for centuries and young people can always solve it and today we have a right direction clean energy you know the climate change all these issues they will be solved and these are the great opportunities ahead of us anything else i agree with that i think the more the more we can the more we can enfranchise people the more we can create ecosystems in which individuals are empowered than where we give rights to individuals to be able to build businesses to be able to to pursue the economic benefit of technologies the more you see these markets change before they leave the stage i want you to look at them and i want you to think about the time we have had to spend here dealing with the refugee problems in syria and lebanon stand up ellis this is my friend elias musab hes the education minister in lebanon hes got to educate all these kids and so he left a miracle that very much reflects the lives that elizabeth and jack have lived he was at a very responsible position at the american university of dubai they started bringing american scholars over there to live in an an arabic culture he did all these wonderful things lebanon gotten probably went home to save his country what is the difference how much more could he and every smart lebanese person do if they could focus on these things and why can he not because the place is dominated by people who think their differences are more important than their common humanity and their common challenges you cannot imagine jack miles proud of being chinese i like that hed never hit it hes happy about it out of product to be a global citizen yeah and i imagine elizabeth proud to be a blonde haired blueeyed american techno wiz from northern california yes but they dont not a word either one of them has said has defined the meaning of their lives or the direction of their work with negative reference to someone else my friend dikembe mutombo stand up no you dont stand up it hurts too much youre an old man my foot too rich fall friend was just inducted into the national basketball association hall of fame and the my family my whole family was and i have seen how much he is given back to his native country congo which has been told troubles ive known him a long time we both went to georgetown university i did before he was born i think ive never heard him say a resentful thing about anybody i have seen him give and give and give try to give the people in his native land opportunities why am i telling you this hes had a good life because he never defined his life with negative reference to anybody else he never regretted anybody elses success and he thought he had an obligation to help other people im telling you this is the we are back in a time of collective global insecurity where the main struggle is the oldest one in human history just in modern techno realities meaning if you were trying to build the middle east you would think about our permanent sponsor here the ambassador from oman who tried to her government tried to help head off a calamitous war in the middle east over the nuclear issue in iran we all pray to god that it will work out on and early to late you look around all these places wherever people are putting aside their differences and working together good things are happening we cannot achieve economic or social equality without living in the factional realities of the world we face looking at the obstacles looking at the opportunities making the best decisions and those of us who even feel good about ourselves because we think we spend a lot of time giving our whole goal should be to work ourselves out of a job one of the things that the bill and tani austin were sitting there with starkey they started giving away hearing aids and then they decided what we better teach these young people how to speak if they get the gift of hearing theyll have to learn that so they got into the education business sunny varkey got in the education business incited somebody ought to do something really dramatic to remind people that the only people that really matter the teachers so he gave the first global teacher of the year award last year and an international panel gave the prize to a teacher from maine who promptly gave the entire million dollars to her school woman never made any money in their life she gave all the money away immediately the future is going to be forged my people who think of how to use the modern tools that we are given as elizabeth and jack have to create opportunity through empowerment and it will not be a straight line its too too many moving parts and but i just want you to think about that the reason you feel good looking at them is that you identify with them even though theyre different from you and thats basically where we are all over again and we cant slip back we cant give up thats why we had the prime minister of italy and george soros talking about the future of europe and george said it was coming apart and the prime minister said no it doesnt have to come apart if its about something more than economics i thought it doesnt have to come apart if you will it not to and you put yourself on the line for it there are no guaranteed outcomes today but you can guarantee that the trend is right so go ahead and were going to say something which i just wanted to add i mean if were talking about the future and and from my own experience and looking at all the faces here i think a huge part of the answer to your question is also to raise our little girls with the stereotype they can be the best in engineering and science and math because when they do in all of these industries it changes everything and we need to do that in this country and we need to do that as parents in other countries yeah i was thinking about if what you say i think about when you want when you talk about problems you normally is like a politician we talk about opportunity opportunity that the businesspeople i was thinking about how we can using you know this all the problems that change the problem to come the opportunity and i dont know i just feel excited when people talk about problems i think thats think about if you can solve one of them thats the chance and today nobody in live in this century has so many opportunities and so many tools they can use the change other peoples life and i think in in the last century which i called it time this century is got a dt ten data technology it is to empower yourself make yourself strong dt is to empower the others when you empower the others you empower your future yourself so when i listen to talk i agree and i think thats why we were born in this century thats why we how we can use the internet to help more people its given my hand thank you,1.0

achieve your dreams with jack mas motivational speech on success in career,we bring you an inspiring speech by jack ma the renowned business entrepreneur and founder of alibaba group in this video,if you have brain if your heart you can make everything possible from my understanding brain is the place where you hold the knowledge education training the heart is the place where your heart the wisdom and iq is the brain and eq is the heart if you have a strong eq you may be easy to be successful but people like you you have a value you have a friendship you have trust but if you have great iq its very difficult for you to film quickly a lot of people easy to get success but losing very quickly that because they dont have enough iq when iq and eq connected that means when brain and heart connected that is the knowledge and wisdom connected that is called innovation and i believe that if you want to be successful you should have the good eq if you dont want to feel quickly you should have iq but if you want to be respected you should have lq the q of love the most precious resource in the world is not oil its not gas its the human brains most innovations not because they want to because they will force the two israel theres no water no oil no resources and most people innovate for success and i find israel people innovate for survive people say jack you are amazing how could you make such a huge investment in nine years ago to develop cloud computing and you know nothing about technology that is true i know nothing but technology im scared of technology i was the first product tester of my company because i said if i can use it eighty percent of people can use it nine years ago i know if we do not develop technology on cloud computing alibaba were bankrupt because we cannot afford the cost of ibm and oracle the cost of using this it too expensive for us so we have to innovate we have to design a technology that is simple enough if we can using that technology simple and cost effective not only for alibaba its also going to support millions of small business that was we were forced and the other thing is that you know we have a november is the largest shopping day of china last year for the first minute of november th we had million people came in first the second was that good technology our company will bankrupt immediately we sold more than billion dollars last year for one day this year we dont know how much we will sell for one night its the technology behind it so we were forced to do that and today a lot of people say oh young people have no opportunities i think that that thing ive heard for years when i was young i oh i hate bill gates because i think microsoft take all the opportunity ibm oracle they take all the opportunity but later i found when people start to complain that is the opportunity most people keep on complaining if you can solve the complaining if you solved the problems and that is the opportunity innovation is the way to solve anxiety worries and to satisfying innovation is for happy life we believe through the innovation you can grasp the opportunity for success the first technology revolution release the physical power of human beings the second technology revolution release the distance and this is the third technology revolution release the human brains we never satisfied with today and the way to make change yourself to embrace this challenge is called innovation and i would like to say who are those kind of innovative people who are these kind of people i would say those innovators they look like crazy stupid lazy and evil lies when we started alibaba i tell the story about i went to silicon valley raising fund i talked to over venture capitalists they say ah crazy alibaba stupid crazy name and ecommerce in china wont work because china has no internet china the censorship your credit card no deliver nothing else so they think its impossible to make i think jack youre coming here to tell a lie but we believe china has the future we believe internet is going to change the china and at that time ecommerce in america style is only support the big companies we believe small business and people say small business they dont make money how could you make money from them theyre right we say if small business in america ecommerce for big companies helping big companies to cut the cost we think helping small companies not to teach them how to cut the cost because they know better than you do you should help them how to make the money and washing machine a lot of things are designed for lazy people where people dont want to wash their washing machine people dont want to climb they have the elevators so innovation innovative the people are believers most of people seeing is believing people like us we believe and we seal it innovators they are not one person they are group of people so when you invest in money in somebody you should see does this guy have followers if you have a group of people who are crazy like him that would be great i remember early i went to the united states to talk about and make my speech about internet in the future in china i believe internet population in china will be bigger than the usa people say ah that is not true my reason was very simple china have billion people usa have only million people make everybody online you know million right so china has a huge potential for that one of the guys said jack what youre talking about internet compilation of values and missions that is crazy and i say sir please come to my company so i came to hangzhou my company spent one week and the day he left is a jet i know youre crazy but i found people in your companies theyre all crazy crazy people dont think theyre crazy they say people outside theyre crazy so and most of the innovators are not very success people because successful people very difficult to change i never tried to convince successful people they would tell you how they succeed they will continue to do this those people who dont succeed they always want to success so one of the reasons why alibaba succeed years ago we never try to convince those people who are successful we try to spend time on the people who are years ago years old they are not successful so years later they become successful we become successful that is how we did it now most of the people who buy online they are to years ago they only spent two daughters now they spend three thousand dollars that is the difference innovation has nothing to do with the technology where we talk about innovation everybody there are high technology its not about that innovation everybody can do it those people who do not know anything like technology like me we can find those people rely on these people try those people who have the technology in our site alibaba side theres a one guy selling shoes inches only and i say how can this guy sell shoes for inches and we find out hes very innovative because people with inches feet difficult for him to buy shoes in the shops theres only one on the online and there are a lot of innovative ways those guys design lazy guys you know they watch tv live on the sofa so they designed a specific glass that you can lie on the on the sofa watch the ons tv they sell perfectly and there are also some guys there are a lot of crazy interesting ideas they are all wonderful sellers and most of the innovation teachings today i only talk innovation they think is an idea entrepreneurs make the innovation reality so we have to share a real entrepreneur have to believe in the future have to suffer have to be ready for the terrible lives in the future so we think i believe everybody has the ability of innovation but you just dont spend the time to discover that and i think the best investment for tomorrow is education in the past years we make people like machines next years we will make mushing like a people you like or dont like it we have to change ourselves this thing is coming what we should do to change our education systems to teach our kids they can do the things the machine cannot do its the entrepreneurships that make ideas reality in s when uk had the first the cars the cars came in automobile coming they destroy a lot of jobs of this horseman horsemen at that time are the main jobs of the society the these are white color people they went to the government pushed the government say you should stop these cars because theyre going to kill people on the road its going to destroy the jobs so the government passed the law called red flag bill they do not allow any car drive faster than seven miles per hour and they should always follow behind the causes people start to worry artificial intelligence robots jobs but dont worry about it human beings are much smarter than machines machine can never control because machine only have chips human beings have their hearts and i want to say dont worry about the future young people dont worry of the future and dont worry about the size of the machine i think small businesses dont worry about because small businesses believe small is powerful small is beautiful using innovation small business can compete anybody in the world today is just the beginning but anything remember this is my philosophy of life the past years today is difficult tomorrow is much more difficult the day of tomorrow is beautiful most people die tomorrow evening music,1.0
self discipline best motivational speech video featuring will smith,of people wont do this must watch ways to stay connected with motiversity and stay motivated subscribe for new,of people are not willing to do what it takes make their dreams come true the marines have a saying everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die the center of bringing any dream into fruition is self discipline you know something as simple as food and eating its not about your body as much as it is about your mind its getting command of your mind to be able to choose actions that are in your own best interest every day we are choosing stuff thats not in our own best interest so if the world is attacking you and the world wants to fight you and the worlds trying to hold you down so youre gonna kick yourself in the balls so you will stop yourself from getting what you dream and i think the word discipline has kind of gotten a bad name we think about it in terms of punishment im not talking about discipline in that way im talking about discipline in the sense that you you forego immediate pleasure for the exchange of longterm selfrespect i believe that selfdiscipline is the definition of selflove that when you say that you love yourself that means that you have behavior towards yourself that is loving selfdiscipline is the center of all material success you cannot win the war against the world if you cant win the war against your own mind selflove is when you say to yourself man look i know you and that girl got a real connection i know yall vibe but thats your girls cousin so i love you too much to let you do that its like you say to yourself hey man look i know you want to eat that pizza and itll be really good you know but i cant let you eat that man cuz if you eat that pizza youre gonna feel like crap you know and i i just i love you too much to let you eat that selflove is a look i know you got a a test on monday you know and i know you really want to go out with your friends and saturday night you want to go out but if you fail that test youre not gonna feel good about yourself you know i just i love you too much to let you go out tonight selfdiscipline is selflove if you wanna be happy you have to love yourself which means you have to discipline your behavior the road to sustained happiness is through disciplining your behavior we tend to base our selfesteem on what other people think and thats not really selfesteem selfesteem is supposed to be how we feel about ourselves and i was just saying how dangerous it is to allow other people to determine how youre going to feel about you and its kind of like looking into a broken mirror youre gonna look in a broken mirror and then change your face to try to look good in this defiled busted broken mirror and it just other peoples opinions theres a really crappy way to determine how we feel about ourselves it dont matter whose fault it is that something is broken if its your responsibility to fix it for example its not somebodys fault if their father was an abusive alcoholic but its for damn sure their responsibility to figure out how theyre gonna do with those traumas and try to make a life out of it its not your fault if your partner cheated and ruined your marriage but it is for damn sure your responsibility to figure out how to take that pain and how to overcome that and build a happy life for yourself fault and responsibility do not go together it sucks but they dont when something is somebodys fault we want them to suffer we want them punished we want them to pay we want it to be their responsibility to fix it but thats not how it works especially when its your heart your heart your life your happiness is your responsibility and your responsibility alone as long as were pointing the finger and stuck in whose fault something is were jammed and trapped into victim mode when youre in victim mode youre stuck in suffering the road to power is in taking responsibility your heart your life your happiness is your responsibility and your responsibility alone you can make a person smile you can make a person feel good you can make a person laugh but whether or not a person is happy is deeply and totally and utterly out of your control the prerequisite for spending time with any person is that they nourish and inspire you they feed your flame look at your last five text messages are those people feeding your flames or dousing your fire put your phone down for just a second and look around look to the people around you are those people throwing logs on your fire or they pissing on it i want my life i want my work my family i want it to mean something and its like it has if you are not making someone elses life better than youre wasting your time the separation of talent and skill is one of the the the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel who have dreams that want to do things talent you have naturally skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft you dont try to build a wall you dont set out to build a wall you dont say im the biggest baddest greatest wall thats ever been built you dont start there you say im gonna lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid there will not be one brick on the face of the earth thats gonna be laid better than this brick that im gonna lay in this next minutes and you do that every single day and soon you have a wall and i think psychologically the advantage that that gives me over over a lot of people that i have been in competition with in different situations is its difficult to take the first step when you look how big the task is the definition of who i am is very clear to me and it also redefines who i want to be in that i know for a fact that im stronger than i thought i was you know you cant help but ask yourself the question what would i do if i was in muhammad alis shoes im motivated by fear i hate being scared to do something and i think what developed in my early days was the the attitude that i started attacking things i was scared why were you scared in your bed the night before why did you what do you need that fear for just dont go why are you scared in your bed hours before you jump why are you scared in the car why could you not enjoy breakfast fear is fear of what youre nowhere even near the airplane everything up to the stepping out theres actually no reason to be scared it only just ruins your day youre you dont have to jump and then in that moment all of a sudden where you should be terrified is the most blissful experience of your life and god placed the best things in life on the other side of terror,1.0

i must keep going powerful motivational speech on perspective featuring marcus elevation taylor,there is someone in their grave today who would do anything for what you have your viewpoint your perspective is,some of you dont even realize you have unfinished business you need to go back where you left off with a new perspective go back to the gym go back to the drawing board go back to the business go back to the relationship go back to the burning building you have unfinished business all you got to do is show up with a new game plan and a new perspective youve got unfinished business you have unfinished business you got work to do perspective is everything lets go i need youto hear me loud and clear how you see this thing is everything you cannot change the past but you can changeyour perspective about it you got to see this thing differently stop complaining about the divorce stop complaining about the job loss stop complaining about the relocation your viewpoint is your advantage thank you for breaking up with me heres what you did you opened up another opportunityfor somebody else to come into my life thank you for firing me you gave me an opportunityto explore entrepreneurship im not bitter i m better perspective is what changes the game everybody wants increaseand abundance and lifestyle change and new zip codes and new area codes but you only read once a week and you only work outonce or twice a month and so the reason why you dont havewhat it is that you seek the reason why whats in your headis not in your hands its not your reality its because your perspectiveopposes your potential you dont have it because you dont see the value in it if you believe youve been calledto be the difference maker the game changer the disrupter the person that comes into a roomand commands the atmosphere if you believe youve been calledto be necessary and not grossly irrelevant then everything you do everything you see everything rises and falls on your perspective your perceptionyour viewpoint how do you see this thing what happens when your perspective your perception diametrically opposes your reality if you are going to give and grow and evolve and attain and become everything rises and falls on your viewpoint show me somebody that hates to work out and i ll show you a manthat almost lost his life and the doctor saidif you dont work out youll die one sees it as cumbersome one sees it as a problem another one sees it as a privilege he sees it as his second chance his new lease on life that i have to work outi get to work out i get a chance to live a little longer so one person sees the gym as a prison and another person sees the gymas a passport one man came within inchesof losing his life and another man has never come withina hundred miles of losing his life and he only works out twice a month and somebody else works outfour or five times a week the reason why you only do itonce or twice a month is because you dont see the value your viewpoint is eitheryour advantage or your assassin your viewpoint will eitherget you going or get you killed we see a storm we see rain and we think depression we think i cant do anything instead of thinking grass cant grow without rain roses dont bloom without rain number one theres one thing i need youto stop saying and that is i should do something that perspective that viewpoint that ideology that philosophy that mindset is going to get you bankrupt i should start this i should stop that i should forgive i should you dont get what you should you get what you must have i must work out x amount of times a week i must forgive i must evolve i must become i must retain i must grow i must live i must evolve i must go to the next level i must live in this type of house i must drive this type of car i dont care how bad you thinkthe shoes are that you are wearing there is another man in this world who would kill to walk a mile in the pair that you wear marcus what does this meanthis means that what you are complaining about what you hate what you cant stand what you want to walk out of what you want to give up on there is somebody out there that would die to be in your position and so heres what i need youto ask yourself is this problem an issue or is it an opportunity some of you all youve been waitingfor your whole life was an opportunity what if losing your job was the opportunity what if the divorce is an opportunity what if the bankruptcy is an opportunity what if the one you lovedwas an opportunity for you to reconnect with somebody and forgive them i need you to see the bigger picture i need you to have a little gratitude you need to learn how to smile you need to work out i know you hate the gym i know you hate to lift weightsi know you hate cardio i know you dont like drinking water i know you dont liketaking care of your simple you think its the hardest thingto do in the world to commit but there is somebodywhos in the grave today and if they had another opportunity to live they would enthusiastically with great confidenceand courage and consistency do what you hate just to live a little longer find the positive see the bigger picture guard your gratitude the trial the tribulation the adversity the giant is not your assassin the giant is your opportunity are you going to complain in the face of conflict or are you going to seize the opportunity i dont care what it isthat youre trying to achieve what youre trying to accomplish what youre trying to give how youre trying to evolve what you are looking to become everything rises and fallson your perspective stop complaining aboutthe jealousy and the envy and the backbiting and the person that gave up on you and the person that wasnt present and the person that lied to you and the person that attempted tomanipulate and control im not weary i m wiser im not toxic i m triumphant i see this thing differently this season that youve entered intodid not come to break you it came to build you into the man or womangod has destined you to be change your perspective theres a reason why they say see the light at the end of the tunnel if you dont see that lightyoure gonna lose your mind you will lose yourself you will snap in half if you dont see past this the challenge for many of us is that we gotta see past our present pain and in to the fruitfulness of the future the right perspective makes the impossible possible you cannot change the past but you can always change your perspective no problem could be solvedfrom the same level of consciousness that created it the severity of your problemsis a matter of perspective change your perspective and most of them become insignificant some of them will no longerexist as problems but opportunities the right perspective is the instrumentyou need the tool you need its a discipline its an advantage if you change the way you look at things then the things that you see will change knowledge a speech a motivational moment will not sustain you unless you put it into perspective how will you see the rest of your day because how you see the rest of your day will oftentimes determine the wayyou see the rest of your life shift your perspective you can change your perspective you can change the future many of you listening to me right nowyou have unfinished business and you need to go back to that dream back to that idea you have a date with destiny you have unfinished business its time for you to go back to the drawing boardwith a new perspective its your viewpoint and watch this your perspectiveactually shapes your language and your language shapes your world and so if you dont start thinking right youre not going to talk right and if youre not talking right youre not going to experience the world that you see in your head i dont know who godhas taught you to become but what i can tell you is if you keep seeing itthe way you have seen it you will never become it everybody wants next level everybody wants wealth and influence and everybody wants to bethis esoteric novelty but listen to meyou will never experience any of this showing up in your next seasonwith the same viewpoint the right perspective makes the impossible possible,1.0
english speech ivanka trump think big again english subtitles,learn english with ivanka trump ivanka the oldest daughter of gop presidential nominee donald trump delivered a speech,good evening thank you one year ago i introduced my father whenhe declared his candidacy in his own way and through his own sheerforce of will he sacrificed greatly to enter the political arena as an outsider and he prevailed against a field of verytalented competitors for more than a year donald trump has beenthe people s champion and tonight he s the people s nominee like many of my fellow millenials i do notconsider myself categorically republican or democrat more than party affiliation i vote on basedon what i believe is right for my family and for my country sometimes it s a tough choice that is not the case this time as the proud daughter of your nominee i amhere to tell you that this is the moment and donald trump is the person to make americagreat again real change the kind we have not seen indecades is only going to come from outside the system and it s only going to come from a man who sspent his entire life doing what others said could not be done my father is a fighter when the primaries got tough and they weretough he did what any great leader does he dug deeper worked harder got better andbecame stronger i have seen him fight for his family i have seen him fight for his employees i have seen him fight for his company and now i am seeing him fight for our country it s been the story of his life and morerecently the spirit of his campaign it s also a prelude to reaching the goalthat unites us all when this party and better still this countryknows what it is like to win again if it s possible to be famous and yet notreally well done that describes the father who raised me in the same office in trump tower where wenow work together i remember playing on the floor by my father s desk constructingminiature buildings with legos and erector sets while he did the same with concretesteel and glass my father taught my siblings and me the importanceof positive values and a strong ethical compass he showed us how to be resilient how to dealwith challenges and how to strive for excellence in all that we do he taught us that there s nothing that wecannot accomplish if we marry vision and passion with an enduring work ethic one of my father s greatest talents is theability to see potential in people before they see it in themselves it was like that for us to growing up he taught us that potential vanishes intonothing without effort and like him we each had a responsibilityto work not just for ourselves but for the betterment of the world around us over the years on too many occasions to counti saw my father tear stories out of the newspaper about people whom he had never met who werefacing some injustice or hardship he d write a note to his assistant in asignature black felt tip pen and request that the person be found and invited to trumptower to meet with him he would talk to them and then draw upon hisextensive network to find them a job or get them a break and they would leave his office as peopleso often do after having been with donald trump feeling that life could be great again throughout my entire life i have witnessedhis empathy and generosity towards other especially those who are suffering it is just his way of being in your cornerwhen you re down my father not only has the strength and abilitynecessary to be our next president but also the kindness and compassion that will enablehim to be the leader that this country needs my father has a sense of fairness that touchesevery conviction he s hold i worked along side of him for now more thana decade now at the trump organization and i ve seen how he operates as a leader making important decisions that shape careersand that change lives i ve learned a lot about the world fromwalking construction jobs by his side when run properly construction sites aretrue meritocracies competence in the building trades is easyto spot and incompetence is impossible to hide these sites are also incredible melting potsgathering people from all walks of life and uniting them to work towards a single mission there have always been men of all backgroundand ethnicities on my father s job sites and long before it was common place you alsosaw women my father values talent he recognizes real knowledge and skill whenhe finds it he is color blind and gender neutral he hires the best person for the job period words and promises no matter visionary theysound will only get you so far in our business you re not a builder unlessyou ve got a building to show for it or in my father s case city skylines most people strive their entire lives to achievegreat success in a single industry my father has succeeded in many on the highestlevel and on a global scale one of the reasons he has thrived as an entrepreneuris because he listens to everyone billionaire executives don t usually askthe people doing the work for their opinion of the work my father is an exception trump on every one of his projects you llsee him talking to the super the painter the engineers the electricians he ll askthem for their feedback if they think something should be done differently or could be donebetter when donald trump is in charge all that countsis ability effort and excellence this has long been the philosophy at the trumporganization at my father s company there are more femalethan male executives women are paid equally for the work that wedo and when a woman becomes a mother she is supported not shut out women represent percent of the total uslabor force and percent of american households have female primary breadwinners in women made cents for every dollarmade by a man single women without children earn centsfor each dollar earned by a man whereas married mothers made only cents as researchers have noted gender is no longerthe factor creating the greatest wage discrepancy in this country motherhood is as president my father will change the laborlaws that were put into place at a time when women were not a significant portion of theworkforce and he will focus on making quality childcareaffordable and accessible for all as a mother myself of three young childreni know how hard it is to work while raising a family and i also know that i m far more fortunatethan most american families need relief policies that allow women with children tothrive should not be novelties they should be the norm politicians talk about wage equality butmy father has made it a practice at his company throughout his entire career he will fight for equal pay for equal workand i will fight for this too right along side of him americans today need an economy that permitspeople to rise again a trump presidency will turn the economy aroundand restore the great american tradition of giving each new generation hope for brighteropportunities than those of the generation that came before in donald trump you have a candidate whoknows the difference between wanting something done and making it happen when my father says that he will build a towerkeep an eye on the skyline floor by floor a soaring structure will appearusually record setting in its height and iconic in its design real people are hired to do real work vision becomes reality when my father says that he will make americagreat again he will deliver we have a chance this year to reclaim ourheritage as a country that dreams big and makes the impossible happen fortunately donald trump is incapable ofthinking small when i was a child my father always toldme ivanka if you re going to be thinking anyway you might as well think big as president my father will take on the boldand worthy fights he will be unafraid to set lofty goals andhe will be relentless in his determination to achieve them to people all over america i say when youhave my father in your corner you will never again have to worry about being let down he will fight for you all the time all theway every time maybe it s the developer in him but donaldtrump cannot stand to see empty main streets and boarded up factories he can t bear the injustice of college graduateswho are crippled by student debt and mothers who can t afford of the childcare requiredto return to work to better the lives of their families other politicians see these hardships seethe unfairness of it all and they say i feel for you only my father will say i ll fight foryou the hard working men and women of this countryidentify with my father he is tough and he is persevering he is honest and he is real he s an optimist and he s a relentlessbeliever in america and all of her potential he loves his family and he loves his countrywith

version of rock bottom so i was willing to let go of everything and everybody see another reasonwhy people wont get there is because the doorwayis for you to fit through youre trying to carryeverybody

simply says whats our command for tomorrow what do you want to create its not keeping scoreyour brain is keeping score because your brain is designedto keep you safe your soul your intuitionyour human spirit is designed to make you soar when you get to the edge your brain will alwaystell you to step back its always going to tell you to step back because you can fall always its going to tell you to

what its going to be likewhen you jump without ever jumping and im just here to tell you jump because only things can happen youre either going to jump and fly or youre going to jumpand fall on something soft or youre going to fall down hard either way youre going to get back up you already know you gotwhat it takes to get back up your greatest fear is notthat you will fall your greatest fear is thatyou will live a full life and never fly that you never leaped youre not afraid of dying you are afraid of dying beforethe world sees who you really are before they really get your fingerprint before they really feel your breath before they really get your contribution before they really feel you thats what you dont want to happen you dont want to leave this placewithout us knowing you are here all im doing is giving my dream a chance and im not extraordinary you dont get off the hook you dont get to be let off the hook im an ordinary woman who chooses every day to make one more extraordinary decision everything that i need to get back up i have in me if i dont have what i needi can go get it once i figured that out the world was my like playground like the question is justwhere do i go get it oh i dont know about thatwhere do i go get it and and i dont come from a learning backgroundwhere i was a great student i wasnt you know my highest gradein school was a c and when i got a c i did the happy dance and and so i didnt have a backgroundwhere studying was natural for me but when i realized that if i go study something and i learn it i own it its mine now man it was crazy because all through school i struggled i the last time i took an english class my english teacher told mei was the weakest writer she ever met in her entire life lovely yeah lovely and the same yeari took a speech class and my speech teacher he saidquote unquote miss nichols i recommend you never speakin public that you get a desk job and so i thats mean yeah it just its just you know it was it was demotivated people sad peoplehurt people hurt sad people make other people sad bottom linedont take it personal hurt people hurt see most people wantthe convenience of transformation without the inconvenience required required for transformation so my grandmother saysand i love to repeat this your conviction whichyoure passionate about your conviction and your conveniencedont live on the same block they aint even in the same zip code so if you want to havea conviction for something you have to sign up sign up to be in convenience were trying to find convictions and passionand breakthrough on the inside of our box well when you realizethat the box doesnt even exist like someone made upoh youre playing outside the box so we all bought into theres a box well i dont livei dont even own a box i dont eveni only want to get in your box like oh you better come out herebecause i aint getting in there and so when you startthinking like that tom all of a sudden everything is possible so i you know peoplei disrupt people when i say you want to make me extraordinarybecause it lets you off the hook what if the god that we call godthe divine whatever your faith is what if there s no partial hes not going to give me a hookupand not give you one not going to give me an opportunityand not give you one i m just going to go after it if i die im gonna die on a treadmill like will smith said i m going to be on the treadmill running you know i m not im just not going to stop because i believeall things are available to us i m just willing to go after themare you willing and then that is so disruptive because then you got to make a decision because it s easierto live inside the parameters of well as a black woman well as born and raisedin south central well i m academicallyi m dyslexic i m dyslexic i wrote seven books i m dyslexic so just knowing like i m not perfect what i do really wellis i manage my imperfection well and so we re all waiting for perfect it s an illusion thatwill never come to you and it s an excuseto never show up and play your story is not meantto be your fortress your story is meant to be your fuel any story like the fact the beauty of me being one of the top earners in america is that i was on government s assistance right like that s the beauty like come on it wouldn t bea big deal if my family was rich whatever like i m supposed to do something the beauty is that when you show the littleengine that could story like i m not going to run fastbut i ain t going to stop running i might slow down and have tobreathe and catch my breath but i m not stopping because i believe all thingsare available to all of us and good people should do well because when good people do well good people just do more good in the world i m that same girl who ran trackfor dorsey high school who struggled to get into high school got kicked out of collegebecause i couldn t afford to stay that was on government si m that same girl i m that same girl i don t forget her i m also that same woman who runs a multimillion dollar business i m also the same womanwho has seven best sellers i own both of those i own all of it i don t shrink to my greatness and i don t live in my saga my sorrow if you can own your brilliance while owning your your imperfections if you can own your giant while owning your smallness if you can live in duality constant duality the freedom will be earth shaking if you can live in that see either you don t want to beas great as you really are and you re trying to dim your light so that others won t feel insecure about themselves in your presence and so you keep playing at watts when you know you resupposed to shine at watts and you keep checkingthe temperature of the room to see what the room can handle versus just giving the roomyou and letting them in but if your lights too bright thenlet them put on some shades can you give yourself permission to live in the duality of yourimperfections and your smallness and what you re learningand what you still have to learn and your greatness and yourbrilliance and your light can you allow them to coexistand then serve them up to the world to love you to see you to inhale you to judge you to leave you to love you you re just some of us arejust as afraid of being loved as we are to be left if you go where you ve never gone do what you ve never done and say what youve never said you ll become the woman and the manyou ve always known yourself to be,1.0

failing at normal an adhd success story jessica mccabe tedxbratislava,jessica mccabe tell us the story of her life once a gifted child with bright future who later lives a life of a constant failures,translator leonardo silvareviewer mile živković hello brains i say that to youbecause if you think about it it wasnt really you that decidedto come here today it was your brain and whether you decided to walkor drive take a taxi or ride a bike that decision was made by your brain behavior all behavioris affected by the brain this is a story about my brain so i was a smart kid by months i was speakingin full sentences by third grade i was scoringposthigh school on standardized tests i had as all my teachers agreedso much potential i was also struggling i didnt have many any friends outside of books i was easily overwhelmedi spaced out in class i lost things constantly and trying to get my brain to focuson anything i wasnt excited about was like trying to nail jello to the wall but i was smart so nobody was worried it wasnt until middle school when i was responsiblefor getting myself to classes on time and remembering to bringmy own homework that being smart wasnt enough anymoreand my grades started to suffer my mom took me to the doctorand after a comprehensive evaluation i was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd if youre not familiar with adhdit has three primary characteristics inattention impulsivity and hyperactivity some people with adhd have moreof the inattentive presentation those are the daydreamersthe space cadets some have more of thehyperactiveimpulsive presentation those are the kidsthat usually get diagnosed early laughter but the most common presentationis a combination of both laughter my doctor and my parents decidedthat given my shiny new diagnosis maybe stimulant medication would succeedwhere spankings and lectures had failed so i tried it and it worked the first time i took my medication it was like putting on glasses and realizing i could seewithout squinting i could focus and without changing anythingmy gpa went up a full point honestly it was kind of miraculous by i had friends that liked me by i had published my first poem i got a boyfriend by i knew i wanted to be a journalist my local college had a programthat would guarantee admission to usc they had a really great journalism program so i signed up at my local collegeand i started taking classes i moved in with my boyfriend things were going great until they werent i started having troublemaking it to class on time i aced a statistics course but i forgot to sign up in timeso i never got the credit i took classes so i could helpmy boyfriend with his career but i completely lost sight of mine i never made it to usc by i dropped out of collegeand moved back home over the next ten years i startedand quit or was fired from jobs i ruined my credit i got married and was divorced within a year at this point i was and i had no ideawhat i was doing with my life besides reading selfhelp booksthat didnt seem to be helping what happened to all that potential was i not trying noi worked harder than anyone i knew i didnt even have time for friends i was that busy i had potential though so my failure was clearly my fault i just hadnt donewhat i need to do to reach it and honestly i was tired of trying putting more effort into lifethan everyone else and falling farther and farther behind at this point i couldhave given up on myself i could have decided that everyonewhod thought i had potential was wrong but i didnt because i knew that it was my behaviorthat had gotten me here and behavior is affected by the brain and my brain has adhd looking at my behavior i knew even with medication even as an adult my adhd was stillinterfering with my life and what i needed to know was how and why and more importantlywhat could i do about it i started to do some research and i found a lot of great information i found a lot of bad information toobut thats another talk but theres good information out there websites podcasts talksby researchers and medical professionals books that would have been way more helpful than the selfhelp books id been usingthat were clearly written for normal well theres no normal neurotypical brains a lot of what i found thoughwas either super technical or seemed like it was writtenfor parents and teachers trying to deal with adhd kids there wasnt a lotthat seemed intended for us the people who have adhd so i started a youtube channel i had no idea how to starta youtube channel but i started a youtube channel i almost called it how not to adhd because that was about alli knew at the time but my boyfriend edwardtalked me out of it it turns out lots of peopleneed help understanding adhd including maybe especiallythose who actually have it i was no exception i thought adhd waskind of the same for everybody i thought it was mostlyabout getting distracted i thought having adhd was maybethe reason that i was failing at life and i thought i was what needed to changein order to be successful i couldnt be successful and still be me spoilers i was wrong so lets go back for a second letsgo back to what brought us here today the brain understanding the brain youre workingwith it turns out is kind of important and thats true whether that brainis your employees your students your kids your significant others or your own adhd affects between and of the global population which means statistically speaking theres between and of usjust in this room you cant tell who we are just by lookingbut its fun to watch you try laughter so at some point youre going to meetsomeone with adhd work with them give birth to them or fall in love with them chances are you already have and at some pointyoure going to ask yourself what is going on in their brain so after two years of learning about adhdand a lifetime of experience with it after having the honor of connectingwith researchers and doctors and adhd experts and tens of thousandsof adhd brains all over the world what can i tell you to help youunderstand adhd by the way many of themhelped with this talk first of all its real its not bad parentingor lack of discipline adhd is a neurodevelopmental disorder its currently the mostwellresearched mental condition and there are actuallymeasurable differences in the brain these differences are larger in childrenbut for most people they never go away in other words adults have adhd too while rates of adhd diagnosisare increasing its not because of an increasein sugar or technology or lack of spanking its not any more than people drowning in swimmingpools is because of nicolas cage correlation does not equal causation those are real numbers laughter its from both an increasein understanding that adhd exists that girls adults and giftedstudents can have it too and ironically a lack of understanding that being hyper misbehavingor struggling in school does not mean you have adhd adhd is more serious than i realized the primary characteristics inattentionimpulsivity and hyperactivity dont sound all that seriousand i didnt think that they were but in real life they translateto people getting into more accidents being more likelyto get fired get divorced significantly more likelyto struggle with addiction i learned that adhd is on a spectrum raise your handif youve ever lost your keys or spaced out in the middle of a lecture if youre not raising your hand im going to assume you spaced outin the middle of this one laughter the thing is while everyone experiencesadhd symptoms sometimes an actual diagnosis is basedon how many of those symptoms significantly and chronically impairmultiple aspects of your life just like you can get sadand not have depression you can get distracted and not have adhd and just like you can havemild depression or severe depression adhd can range from mild to severe i also learned adhdis a terrible name for adhd it creates a lot of confusion we dont have a deficit of attention what we have trouble withis regulating our attention as adhd coach brett thornhill puts it its like your brain keeps switchingbetween different channels and somebody else has the remote sometimes we have trouble focusing at all and other times we get stuck on a channeland cant pull ourselves away which in real life might seemwe dont want to do homework because wed rather play video gamesand short sometimes thats the case but the truth is there are plenty of timeswe want to able to focus we try and we just cant current understandingis that this difficulty has to do with the way our brains produceand metabolize neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine i learned adhd is highly treatable stimulant medication booststhese neurotransmitters which is why it helps us focus its very effective for around of people with adhd and i learned that medication isnt enough adhd affects much more than our focus it impairs executive functionslike planning prioritizing and our ability to sustaineffort toward a goal it affects our ability to regulateour emotions our behavior our sleep its not one program in our brainthat works differently its the whole operating system it can affect every aspect of our lives and there are a ton of strategiesout there that can help cognitive behavioral therapy coachingeven meditation or regular exercise can help make a huge differenceunderstanding your brain i knew i had trouble focusingand i knew my medication helped with that what i didnt know was that gettingoverwhelmed all the time had to do with poor working memoryand that making lists helps or that the reason i ran late all thetime wasnt because i didnt care its because adhdershave a skewed sense of time and that using a timer could teach mehow long things actually take mostly i expected to learnwhat i actually learned that adhd is real addressing it is important and medication is not enough what i didnt expect to learn that i wasnt alone i had an adhd tribe what a difference it would maketo connect with it there are people with adhdin every country every culture across the globe yes even in france laughter and this tribe is awesome comparing myself to peoplewith neurotypical brains i felt really bad about myself why couldnt i keep my house cleanor finish a project in time instead of waitingtill the very last second but seeing the positivesin fellow adhd brains helped me recognizeand appreciate my own strengths ones i couldnt see when i wasjust staring at my weaknesses which is what id been doing for decades but adhd brains havea lot to offer the world we tend to be generous funny creative adhders are more likelyto start their own business we not only think outside the box were often not even awarethat there is a box laughter we may struggle whenour brains arent engaged but adhd brains are greatat tackling tasks that are urgent working with ideas that are new wrestling with problemsthat are challenging and dedicating themselves to projectsthat are of personal interest this youtube career id stumbled intowas all of those things at i was divorced miserable and had no ideawhat i was doing with my life at id started my own businessand was connecting with adhd experts by now at i have a team of volunteershelping with the channel im engaged to this amazing manwho helps me produce the channel works right alongside with meis doing the slides right now and as we discovered also has adhd laughter im working on reaching out to schools so that kids dont haveto wait until theyre to learn about their brains and im doing my very first tedx talkhere with you today cheers applause but wait theres more wait applause that did sound like the endof the speech im sorry its not laughter im happier and more successfulthan ive ever been in my life so what happenedhow did i reach my potential three things one i learnedabout my brain my adhd brain both on my own and by connectingwith others who have it if you judge a fishby its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole lifebelieving it is stupid unless it happens to chat with another fish and realizes fish arent greatat climbing trees and thats okay theres plenty of ocean two in learning about my brain i found and stumbledinto a job that engages it if you spend all your time tryingto get a fish to able to climb a tree youll never see how far it can swim it turns out i can be meand still be successful i just had to find my ocean three i learned strategiesfor challenges i still face i have no fish analogyfor this one im sorry laughter i guess i learned how to swim once you know whatyour brains challenges are you can find solutions to them once you look past the stereotypesand assumptions about people with adhd and dig deeper you learnwhat adhd actually is its not people who wont stop fidgetingor getting distracted it is brains that arechronically underaroused trying to get the basic levelof stimulation all brains need its not about procrastinatingor not caring its having executive function deficitsthat make it hard to get started and its not people being lazyor not trying enough its kids and adults struggling to succeed with a brain that doesnt alwayswant to cooperate in a society that wasnt built for them society is our users manual we learn how our brains and bodies workby watching those around us and when yours works differentlyit can feel like youre broken so what im trying to dois reach out to these people wherever they arein the world and tell them you are not weird you are not stupid you do not need to try harderyou are not a failed version of normal you are different you are beautiful and you are not alone if you dont adhd yourself chances areyou know somebody who does theyre your employee your bossyour friend theyre in this room i hope this talk helps youunderstand them better if you do have adhd welcome to the tribe applause cheers,1.0

all ages shapes and sizes to new empowered versions of themselves charles thanks for joining and good to see you good to see you again a time for those of our viewers who do not know your story give us a little background tell us about yourself and how you know as a kid i was pounds here in the picture i could get up a flight of stairs that breaking sweat his boy i was teasing i realized despite all the different things that try theres something missing and that missing link is how to really disconnect from using food emotionally reactive lee and free yourself from that pattern then in time connect in a way allows you to live in a real liberated way now you not only transform yourself why youre doing that youre laying the groundwork for being able to help other people because so many people are just overwhelmed and flooded with information that contradicts the next piece of information read this book it says if you do this will change your life you read another book it says if you do that youll kill yourself so i realized that there had to be a way to kind of cut through all right because how many die its how many exercise programs how many pieces of equipment out there that say if you do a little change your life but i think those things are the answer i wouldnt have the problem i had years old and my clients like the one were going to hear what had the problem he has what was the key element for you what was is the way to do it this is the pathway i think that it was realizing that if things are going to be different i was going to be different so often we want something to blame we want to have a a reason to excuse ourselves from our own personal power shows really change my mindset and so i work with some someone it certainly has something to do with healthy eating right so they have a food plant they have an exercise program but the missing link what we work on is how to change your mindset so doing what you know you need to be doing becomes on the attic where they go one of the people that charles helped turn his life around is tim gathered and before you get with you pounds heavier right yes thats right and he was on sleep apnea machine c

amazing tim tell what was it like what was so life changing getting together with charles i think the big thing for me was especially during that journey one when im losing right is that accountability its my thought process and the cognitive dissonance between what i wanted and what i was doing and then moving forward how how to thinking right charles was a great catalyst theres a lot of work for me to do but my routine meetings with him right was was the catalyst to continue moving forward lets talk about some of the things that have changed for mention no more c pap machine that thats gone tell me some of the other things the health benefits youve experienced through this weight that the biggest thing i think is just the ability to move great move freely move comfortably that youre in your daily life i dont think we recognize that i didnt recognize how much my freedom of movement was by my weight so thats one of the big things and i think just my who i am as an individual and and what i aspire to for the future i think i had goals before now i aspire much higher real quick what would you say to somebody theres bound to be people out there that are in the same situation you are who have think theyve tried it all and nothing is going to work why should they get in touch with charles well i mean change doesnt if what youre doing isnt working right if if what youve tried for in my case it was years wasnt working i needed something i had found success or i found that my friends have had success with charles those with the tipping points if you will to

i got fired then miracles started happening the success story of a single mother lnn,one morning damaris showed up to work only for the watchman to tell her she was not allowed and he was under strict,so i took my machine and other belongings from the office i went to set up a home office at my home i wanted to go work from there as long as its done following day when i showed at work in the morning the watchman tells me he was instructed not to let me in and thats how i was fired from my job lynn all because you declined to remain behind yes that night but the job was done and i sent it i submitted the work and he did not pay me for that job i had done everything and it was a very good presentation all my eggs were in that basket and that was it he did not pay me for that job to be honest life was quite difficult especially after some time my son came along when he came along i started viewing life differently because now i was not feeding my stomach alone remember i was struggling before because lynn i resulted to selling potatoes at that time to this person when i tell you theres soft life are these still referred to as sofa sets these recliners my people i have to pay some bills whether in need of food you can buy some using bonga points airtime credit data bundles all these options are there lift one another and lets go beyond and now lets have a seat and listen to this story i hear they have switches too jesus im about to embarrass myself right now damaris why is it not moving and i call it dada fundi and young people in the industry including young men i was that last child at home i enrolled school at a tender age i went to boarding school while young despite the life and my independence unfortunately i lost my father along the way which sort of destabilized my life thoughts and plans for the future but this things come unexpected my mum supported me in a huge way i think shes my biggest fan my fan number one in whatever i do and my life too shes my biggest cheerleader along the way while in school i was really confused you know that child whos confused in school doesnt know what they want in future i can make a drawing of you exactly as you are is it hype or you can actually do it yes i can i paint work abstract art i tried selling my paintings but it was a little bit tricky for me because when the client asses your work they under quote as less as kshs but what can you do much with kshs i wanted something that i can make progress in life with i went on and i was thinking i went to learn fine art after school but this teacher was the kind that the one who says by the way you can become an illustrator come i teach you afternoon you remain at home in desk for two hours but it did not work for me i used to ask myself how can i use my art to beautify my environment be it furniture clothes you try use that creativity and figure what to make out of it to be honest life was difficult especially after some time my son came along i started viewing life differently because now i m not feeding my stomach solely and it was still difficult for me before because its my life and yet putting the bills together was a problem here is another stomach at that time i resulted into selling potatoes i used to go to the market and buy them i get them from the farm too directly and sell at the market i had done that in kongowea market in mombasa and marikiti market nairobi you know molo area from the source i used to go there on ground i was on my gumboots looking for potatoes and then take them to market cabbages potatoes and carrots but main thing was i really hustled with my son im trying to put bills on the table dont forget that but i had no one to mentor me or hold my hand and say lets do this or that i continued with my potato business but still i felt something is needed then my son fell sick because of too much traveling remember i was going all the way to mombasa so today we are in molo tomorrow we are in mombasa he was on my back all along everywhere i went we traverse from molo to mombasa then nairobi at times even busia town my son got sick and contracted malaria i vowed that whether i have to look for money or not this is where i humble myself and then tell my mum that now i need a course at least where im sure i have this skill and make money out of it instead of doing rounds with my son along its going to be too difficult for me she assured me not to worry upon arriving there a lady at the reception looked at me then she said go seek another course because i went to look for building and construction she just gave me that glare and told me to look for another course i asked why but she told me the course is full so i look for something else to pursue i had no one to tell me i can insist to them since you are paying for the course and settled to doing mass communication but still in my heart i was like no to society through the skill that i will learn i sought somewhere i could receive studies i dint have anybody who can point me any direction god will remain to be god back where i was studying mass communication we stayed for the weekend we stopped at a certain hotel where we went to sit and eat the uncle told me the owner of the place is a designer and i responded that id like to meet him just to hear how things work he called and owner and he came very humble person he came and said hi to us i got interested and engaged him in questions i cant even recall what we ate there or talked about later that was the main focus of that meet up i got so interested i asked him one question i wont be nagging too oh you said you dont each much yeah i requested to follow him just for a day i would cater for my own lunch i forfeited everything even the things i was pursuing in mass communication we can go view them a total stranger i did not know him before and he humbly accepted he told me come along that ive ever had he has been my huge mentor till what i know now i learned from somewhere i am so humble because this guy really held my back i was looking for the mantle and he handed it over to me he would not just drag me along to site and tell me i know nothing no wed go to site and he says give me your input he taught me a lot and in so many places he left me to manage so he handed me that responsibility mantle once im done with a project i have to send him a picture and tell him teacher look at your student even back home we are good friends along the way he had a company called domine and since i was just a shadowing person the jobs were many such that he could go to one site and i go to the other and we split you were still in your here and you are a mum who bumped into her dreams job before while i was selling the vegetables i used to live on my own but after realizing my son was suffering for all that traveling my son was in school i leave in the morning drop my son to school then i go to work remember i was not waiting for any salary you keep going to work because you are a mentee he encouraged me that you know what and learn about it officially instead of just doing it casually go to school i wondered where do i enroll for school i was working while still getting education so when others are introduced to it i already know these things im already done when it comes to school project this guy had a company so as we worked together i made partner i made partner that time alone he keeps on adding value there are people who are good lynn step by step whatever i used to get at least i can pay of bills at school remember i was at home still so i had less bills my son is still young i had no much to do in life the money i channel it to school of course i had some things that id want to do you now i was still fresh from school i want to go out there and do big things so i stepped in the field i remember someone employed me these were challenges now it was an office set up but it was very tricky to work there he was an indian hed give us work in the office sometimes there quarrels in office who did this who did that we had a lot going on there i could not get creative enough my creativity was overshadowed the client was from holland he was to set up a brand here in kenya where we can prepare the designs for the client but those colleagues in office a lot of them resigned out of the quarrels there but based on problems i had i never thought of resigning it was too difficult for me to resign so we got the holland project and i designed i did my work on the last day for us to finish the design i submitted to my boss the showroom design and made a presentation to him that day but he said there were changes that he needed to do before i submit the design fully it was not far from where i lived he told me i should stay overtime remember i had a son and the child has to be picked from school yes and i dint have a home manager i was the one to go home cook for my son and prepare his everything but the boss insists i have to stay for overtime but based on my job i can still carry it home so i decided staying for overtime is not good its at night which i dint think was appropriate his office was there too and his home nearby too so i dint feel it was very appropriate to do so remember i had done the presentation to him he said i do more adjustments i took my machine and all my belongings i went to set up a home office in my house as long as the work is done im good following day i report to work in the morning the watchman at the gate says ive been instructed not to let you in thats how i got fired from my job lynn i lost my job in that manner because you refused to remain overtime because i declined to remain there that night but the job was done and i sent it i submitted the work and he did not pay me for that job i had done everything all my eggs were in that basket and the job just went by the wind he did not pay me for that job afterward had you saved anything lynn i was in my early beginnings i was just starting afresh remember i had just left my mums place i was living alone just starting and this is the first employment job that i got my son was in a new school so it was very challenging for me i would get a few jobs here and there sometimes you get an order to design outdoor furniture another one wants you design an office partition these small small things was matters to do with payments the clients promise to pay youve already shown them the design and this is what i want us to do they say no problem and go ahead to buy the materials they issue a down payment to you they dont pick calls you cannot get hold of anybody theyve just disappeared i tried to figure out but it became difficult to a point that i could not even fit in because me putting in together a job it was coming along once in a while i met a certain client when it comes to this client i made mistakes lynn by this i mean youve arranged the work and done as required but he really gave me a chance he used to say dont worry we will redo this again he did not shout at me or say i was insufficient this person gave me chance he held my hand all through till we finished the project not even a single day did i run without cash no and all through when i had a problem hed say if you have personal issuesthis things happen he was understanding to me he really helped me through she really held my hand when you reach your destination people who really needed mentorship you see like the person who held my hand first time and became my mentor i realized people need mentors at least one gets a start off in life and single mothers are quite many they need help to at least stand on their own she told me she lost her job over covid she needs footing since she has kids i tried to mentor this lady to at least grasp one or two things so that she can be able to take a job like a contract such that even if someone doesnt know me out there and they want to know something to do with construction not everyone wants to do design some want be carpenters like me i always dreamed to be a carpenter since i was a kid people would say i dont look like a carpenter people have got their own opinion but mostly ladies ladies come along and i teach them these things be it electrical cabinetry carpentry all those things and i mentor them hold onwhat do you do exactly me i do design for instance if its your house i start from the design layout of the house after construction interior fittings has to do with electrical plumbing carpentry all that i do for you to a fine finish you do all that including plumbing yes the day your sink clogs call me over you can repair my sink i can come do the repairs i do all those things hold on bel fitting things together and they match things to do with flowers and ensuring things match so you can repair sinks too yes you see a job like this one to make this my team of workers it is us the team i dont say it is my project it is our project can you construct a house like this one definitley have you done it before yes if you give me that trowel for plastering youll be surprised that the course has no space its full shes playing us does she know what shes talking about you might find yourself working with a new construction guy and he does not know how you work or maybe sometimes recommended by the client so you give such a person your input but when they listen to you i learned to interact with most people who bear such opinions when i meet such a person i shine the brightest then they see the results yes you see the way you do a leisure activity to unwind for instance you have a situation requiring a solution do you lynn i actually sleep on it and wake up with a solution it just comes automatically i love my job i studied in difficulties it is not easy to work get money and pay school at the same time you still have to go back to work and get that money again take it back to school again when i came into the industry you find that when a client looks at the job what shes consulting for they feel its not worth that amount of money they feel you should do better sometimes they even accept but you get paid half the money then the rest they fail to pay in full and when they fail to pick up your calls thats it both you and the client sign a contract and then you go by it and you might not be able to get hold of them you try looking for them all over youll never get them sometimes you even realize you are spending so much money to follow that money and it is not even worth it you might be having the skill and be having so much things that can add value to people but if you lack the opportunity to execute you have nothing thank you and may god grant you long life someone says to you take that house run with the project they dont even know you theyve trusted you with their project i usually say all this is because of god how far are you on that currently there is a young guy im mentoring mentoring is every time and i dont stop at all you even find some whom i mentored earlier they call and ask by the way i need some skills to patch up a certain area we have those with slight knowledge others want to advance and i mentor even when im doing all other projects in what i do because we go to work together but now the main challenge i had previously is because i had no skill lynn thats when i discovered how important it is to have a skill having a place you know once you return back in the evening you can provide for the ones waiting for you getting home with something because you know when that person goes back home they have something to put on the table im a mum or a dad life has taken toll on me people should rise up and above what the society has given them as their standards people should not say there jobs for men and women no especially single mothers if one comes to me ill teach them no matter what level they know even if they are at zero and have never held a hammer they will learn nothing satisfies you as a single mother so i urge them not to fear and they go back to learn skills yes of course i fell twice or thrice along the way but its the norm i never give up i decided to be in that outfit like i can also blend in i was blending with that outfit of the kind of job that i do as for melet me just remain in my gwagon the rest i shall think about it after gwagon you dont want to be like a slay queen on construction site so while there you dive deep in the dirt yes you give me a hammer i have told you to give me the plastering trowel in the field you have a name for it locally its called gurumara i hand over the gurumara to you yes once you give it to me youll be surprised everyone else has come from far and they have their unique challenges too i can recall the challenges i was facing back in time and i think a lot of people could be in my shoes right now i went through a very tough time most of my construction guys weve known each other for many years and did lots of projects they can approach me and say i have a personal problem here and we have put a platform where we can easily converse with each other without fearing each other with all my construction guys in ever site i go to whether its our first time working together or not i have that thing where i give on freedom to talk to me and they say what they think he did not push me aside and say that i know nothing no be it personal or work related this house is just smart the way it is i can just put this and a chandelier there when one starts construction they have this in mind and then later on you look at your house carpets tiles dont match because there are things that dont just go together their work to be top notch they should start the planning so it doesnt appear as an after thought where you put brown tiles and then red couches you dont have to do it on your own yes there are those who can but in some instances it can be difficult i dont like to buy something that is identical and with everyone out there i seek materials designers and all that sometimes you buy something that you cant find anywhere else by outfit my people might think we are referring to clothes like how colors have come together those molds the way theyve been placed everything and how they fall in place it is preplanned we sat down and discussed and you decided on sitting room layout kitchen will be there bedrooms over there yes youve worked as a doctor but you figured thats not where i want to be because you studied mass communication somewhere whether you are fifty or sixty years once seated in a corner quietly it will always knock you to whoever feels they want to do this i dont dwell on age this will reach a point they go over me this one i cant leave them to make decisions all along when i went to school and while i was a professional i have mentored a lot of people who never went to school and they still get jobs yet me i went to school the whole time i remained without a job im sitting down and thinking someone has been mentored by me and they go out there lynn you come to me i teach you how to hold a hammer and make that table i will be walking shoulders high saying this is my project besides doing a house and they are able to do something for themselves you put too much effort in work id prefer to mentor someone they learn and if they become good than i am even better ive taught a lot of people who go beyond me and they were my juniors you find someone calling you on phone and they say kindly help me out here that personally youve learned from experience when you help others out you go even further when you hold other peoples hands along the way as a leader its good if you are personal dont take them as a group be personal to every individual each have their set of challenges they have their weaknesses and strengths too i dont like treating them as a group they will go higher from the limit youve set for them lift others beyond yes if you lift them they lift you too god acknowledges that and lifts you too our show is sponsored by safaricom tuinuane and they are advocating for same thing denzel washington usually says my people you can check that on google but we have something of the sort i usually ask myself in this country if you lift one person and i lift another one how many people have we changed their lives but you find there are people who just want to go trough success journey by themselves so the key is tuinuane will you answer please do i dont think i can answer that kindly tell us what surprised you i would say theres a time i made some good money that surprised me but i wont quote the figure but it shocked you yes it did that at some point in life my money would solve out my problems in life i felt it is so difficult to even fend for myself youve gone to school and did all this get a job where you are not paid that i have done this entire work this person will pay me someone gives you chance and they tell you this is what you do you are the one handling the project and with such trust i am telling you id rather work day and night but i will not let you down people love my work and also the way i work with them since you ve paid for i try to do for you what id remind people out there is that lets lift one another up and they dont say you just thought of siring a child and bringing them here but we also have toxic people out there all i would say to people especially when one has just delivered a child and they face a lot it is not the right time to condemn such a person because if they are back home that means you are their last result they face a tough life and they want to start afresh if they say mum help me just do it you will welcome them too i dont know if she usually watch but you can share a link to her for this video people who have lifted you high and those youve mentored too that has held my hand my mentors and those who gave me a chance i would not have come this far without you maybe you are at your edge you wonder what to do next you want to do a certain job yet you are told to stop dreaming of construction dont fear come in here lets work we be dada fundi we grab a hammer and get in construction lets build our country lets hold hands youve nailed it safaricom ive already paid your bills registered names on the number majority know me as d and d mostly stands for design dada fundi let me add another one d for daughter and they just decided this is my passion and i have to fight for it i hope one day when god blesses me you will go to make my house beautiful it shall come to pass by gods grace we have already agreed on what to put up top this show i know its sponsored by tuinuane but i hope youve seen how that works you can use your bonga points to purchase food as youve heard if you walk alone well you will reach somewhere but if you walk with others you can go miles almost heaven because if we lift her up is the audio good can you hear me and god will remain to be god see you tomorrow or the day after bye god bless,1.0

one of the greatest speeches ever steve jobs,steve jobs the exclusive biography steve jobs delivers an inspirational speech listen to the end for,today i want to tell you three stories from my life thats it no big deal just three stories music the first story is about connecting the dots i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a dropin for another months or so before i really quit so whyd i drop out it started before i was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking weve got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers that a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford and all of my workingclass parent savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldnt see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didnt interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting it wasnt all romantic i didnt have a dorm room so i slept on the floor in friends rooms i returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example read college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out and didnt have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science cant capture and i found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life ten years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac its likely that no personal computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards years later again you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the wellworn path and that will make all the difference music my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i love to do early in life was and i started apple in my parents garage when i was we worked hard and in years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned and then i got fired how can you get fired from a company you started well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at i was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating i really didnt know what to do for a few months i felt that id let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me i met with david packard and bob noyes and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit id been rejected but i was still in love and so i decided to start over i didnt see it then it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed it next is at the heart of apples current renaissance and lorraine and i have a wonderful family together im pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadnt been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometime life sometimes lifes going to hit you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did youve got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking and dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking dont settle my third story is about death when i was i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past years ive looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life what i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life its lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but its quite true your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drowned out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary stay hungry stay foolish,1.0
multimillionaire explains his simple steps to selfmade success,this is multimillionaire everette taylors ultimate advice on becoming massively successful from nothing special thanks to tom,actually being successful or like moving outof our moms basement or whatever we put so much energyand time into the presentation of not looking like that situation instead of putting the energyand time into actually finding a solution to that issueand so at that point it was like okay ive been puttinga lot of time and effort trying to pretend things are good instead of actuallytrying to find solutions and then thats when i started to do everything i needed to do to tryto make money and just really when i say embraceits not necessarily like accept it for what it isits almost like okay this is real i need to figure this out taking your surroundingsyou take in the people around you you see how theyre making money and i just didnt likebegging people for money and so i respected the guysthat were like figuring out hustles right and so for instance there was an amacoright down the street from me and so i would go there and i wouldwash windshields and make money just try to save up enough moneyto just be in a motel for the night and i mean like the nastiest motel but for me it was just taking in my environmentseeing how other people hustled how i can do it better someone taught me how to playdrums on buckets and things like that and so you know i justtried to do any type of hustle that i could i just started to learn how others were movingand kind of adapted throughout for me its its opening your mindand opening yourself to people i think a lot of people they are ignorant they arelike rejecting change travel get out of your comfort zone meet people from all differenttypes of backgrounds if you want to build a productor service or company that you want to build at scale and your friends are only the homiesthat youve been hanging out with since you know middle school probably should meet some more people get to know them travel the world you know and even if youdont have the resources to travel the internet learn about differentcultures learn about different people youre at that computeryou tell me what you want to do i tell you this is how you search this is this is howyou find those resources now you got to actually go and learn you have to be able to show peoplethat theres other options and thats whatspreading seeds is all about showing people that they canactually do something different theres one thing being homeless but theres another thing havingeverything taken away from you i was literally living out of my car and so even though i was homeless i was still trying to upholdthe appearance of everything being okay when that moment happenedit was like whoa this is rock bottom because now all my clothes are gone all the cool shoesall the things that were material umm that you know i tried to fake ituntil i figured things out were gone now and not only that all the the the elements so now rain and snow and all thesethings can get in the car so it was like mildewy and smellyand so i smelled right and so for me in that moment i understood that wow this isi thought things were bad but things are reallyreally bad at this point and now i cant pretend anymorei just have to really embrace this i think a lot of timeswhen were going through things we kind of try to figure out how were going to finesse our way into people not knowing that thingsthings are wrong instead of just saying this is my life this is real now you have like these brief momentsof kind of peace until like the nextaccident happens right and thats just life in general you know its never going to becomplete smooth sailing one of the things thati ve noticed about a lot of people is that they let the hardshipsand the things that happen in their life failure stop them from like aaliyah says you knowdust yourself off and try again right and for me i ve just never let anything or anybody prevent mefrom achieving what i want to achieve so i ve always hadthis relentless mentality and if you say i cant do something if i fail if i you know mess up it just motivates me even morei just become even more hungry and so i ve always just had this you know relentless mentality i dont take you know no for an answer i dont take failureor accept failure at all and its just always been kind ofin my heart to not give up its the rose that growsfrom concrete right its like no matter howterrible a situation is no matter how bad it is theres still going to be a rosethat grows from that concrete and i feel like i was that right no matter what my situation wasi was built for this i was not going to let myself fail right and i had that mentality and i understand that now that i grew from that concretei m starting to plant my seeds and theres more roses growing whats so specialabout the internet now is really anything you wantto do you can learn like if you want to learn how to codeif you want to be a developer you want to build softwareyou want to build apps you can literally go on youtubeand learn how to code and so what i would tell that person is what do you want to do tell me anything what do you want to do right now theres resourcesand theres things online that can help you build yourselfinto whatever that is so i think that that kidat the end of the day he has to have that kind of just i got to make this happen right heres the thing no one can teach you that at the end of the day manyou really got to want it you got to really want it and i think the problem isis now with social media before when i was growing up i didnt see all these examplesof people having cool cars or doing cool stuff all the time like right and now with social mediai dont care if youre in like you know in the middle of nowhereyou can log on to instagram and see just this whole worldof experiences and things the problem is its like oh well these people have itso i should be able to have it and its just like man you dont seethe work that goes behind this man i started my firstmarketing job at i m years into entrepreneurship it wasnt until the past few years where i started reallygetting recognition for it right and so people dont see all that it takes to even get to that pointand thats the problem and so they think its supposed to bethis this overnight thing oh i started llc give me money no thats not how it works this is a marathon this is not a sprint right you never know when thatmoment is going to happen in your life where you find that passionor you figure it out the fun partis just trying a bunch of stuff like when you get to a point whereyou can just try a bunch of stuff its like hey sit down make a list i m interested in all thesedifferent things right okay i m interestedin these top five things now how can i do something that not only am i passionate aboutwith one of these top five things but also make at leastenough money to just get by a lot of times the thing thats stopping us from being the person thatwe truly want to be is ourselves its usually ourselves and i think being able to identify mental health depression anxietyall these things that were dealing with and say that we want to make a change and we humble ourselvesto want to make that change is one of the biggest barriersthat one can break through i m going to launch a much moresuccessful business when i do launch it and its because i took the time to learn and i just think that peopleare in such a rush to have something especially money money is likeoh i got to get more money but its like if you launchsomething thats piss poor even at a point where i hadaccomplished so many things i almost did it right were not perfect i m not perfect you know i still mess up all the time man earlier today like i was came hereat the wrong time right so we we mess up constantly but its its identifying that and sayingwait let me take a step back and let me do this the right way i am inspired by helping people if i can make money toodamn thats cool too right but the thing that reallygets me out of bed right now is my ability to help people i dont need any more moneyi dont need any more material things you know as well as i knowthat gets old right and you know it feels good temporarily but it doesnt really holdany weight or substance and so the thing that i feel like our legacy is how do we affect as many people as possible in the most genuineand impactful way right and for me that is what drives me today,1.0

you have a story to share about tinnitus were not going to tell allof it in this very moment and there was a firearm thatwent off pretty close to me and that was when or how it happened for the first few daysdefinitely in the first few hours it was a a bit alarming i wasnt sure if it wasever going to go away i mean i figured itwas kind of like going to a concert or somethingand it would just go away in a couple days so i tried to not think of it too much but it didnt go away laughs and i did talk to a doctor and he said oh yeah thats probablygoing to be with you forever and it was pretty shocking to hear that and thankfully it wasntthat highpitched of a noise so it was very tolerable it was okay i justlearned to live with it after about a week or so ijust kind of tuned it out so it was pretty minimal which was great you know nothing ever really fluctuated and i didnt reallyhave any issues with it until just this year andjust a few months ago when or the beginning of thisyear when i got covid and i dont know if it isdirectly related to covid i cant really prove that but ever since i didmy ears have been doing some really strange things and like i said i mean the last years it was very constant andit never bothered me i learned to live with it it wasnt too bothersome but then one night just doingdishes my ears just all of a sudden just wentimitates highpitched noise and just when i mean i dont know from maybe times the volume i mean it was extremelyloud and it got to a point where it was difficultto do daytoday tasks just to think normally to work especially being in quietspaces was extremely difficult sleeping i mean you nameit it messed my life up i didnt know where togo or what was happening at the time i didntrelate it to covid at all i just thought it was bad luck you know and like oh my goshsomethings happening here the ringing in my ears isjust decided to go bonkers so what did you do where did you first go looking for help dr google local doctorsent doctors where did you go first step was ent doctor yeah and yeah i didnt go to drgoogle for a little while but yeah so where i was living we havea good hospital over there so i decided to go there first and being that it was during covid apparently they were going through some pretty major staffing issues yet they did see me andi did do an ear test and i could hear just fine and they said everything was fineyou can hear just fine but were going to give youa call in a few days or so and the audiologistwants to talk to you so i said okay a few days passed no call i was waiting anxiously because this was just affecting my daytoday living so i called them and anywayswe went back and forth for a little bit apparently their audiologist quit before i even did the hearing test so that kind of frustrated me i ended up im originally fromhouston and theres a good you know the texas medicalcenter is down there so i decided to kind of seekout a known professional and i said okay let me killtwo birds with one stone go visit some family andseek out another audiologist and see if i can find one first of all i dont know i just know thathouston has a lot of doctors so i did find one she was pretty expensive shehad very high credentials she had much much better equipment than the one that i previously went to so as far as equipmentwiseand the types of tests and treatment she wastalking about were by far it was all new to me so the other place did not say anything in those regards at all yeah so youre in this position where you know you need help its affecting yourdaytoday functioning you said sleep work concentration im sure that it broughtup a lot of anxiety like you had mentionedof waiting for clarity on what is my path forward here and then youre havingto just find a doctor find a specialist who can work with you during this whole time thoughyoure still struggling as you mentioned so what happens next there you speak to someone who seemsa little more knowledgeable and then what happened next yeah so they gave me a couple tests and didnt do so well on those ones and the next step wasextremely expensive treatment and that was basically a tinnitus masker and that was basically it and i thought there hadto be another solution so thats when i startedgoing to dr google laughs and i found you and ibelieve it was on youtube and started looking at someof the stories kind of like this one so hopefullythis helps some people out yeah so i was doing alot more research and at this point yeah itwas driving me crazy i mean it was mentally not good mentally challenging and affecting work affecting a lot of thingsand also depressing it was too much laughs so i needed something and found you guys and yeah thats when i gave you a call and im glad i did so everything has worked out i started talking with oneof your audiologists there and we created a strategy that has helped other people in the past i also jumped onto a group session and it was really good tohear what other people were you know what they were feelingand what they were trying to do to help relieve the situation so i got some more helpful tips that i didnt even know of or think of cause this was all new to me so i started doing thosepractices and staying on plan with what your audiologist had set for me and yeah i mean my goal honestly was i know it may never go away but my goal was just to getit back down to where it was and i mean it was verybad it was extremely loud and then sometimes it would even peak and it would fluctuate it would get even louder to the point where if i was walking itwould stop me dead in my tracks and i just have to breatheand just hope and pray that it goes back downto the new norm laughs which it did thankfullyafter about maybe a minute seconds to a minuteof peaking or spiking but yeah i mean with you guys help i was really able to put a plan in motion it was not as expensive as theother audiologist that i saw i feel that the teamsthat you have in place the people that you have in place are also more there versus the otherfew audiologists that i saw so its good to have someone there that you can kind of rely on and if youre having a badday you can at least reach out and just at least let someone know but anyhow with all of that being said it all worked out and mytinnitus level thankfully is back to where it once was so tell us more about that first of all congratulationsand i know it takes a lot of work on your end toput the pieces together tell us more about howmuch your tinnitus improved during the treatment and also explain what were you doing were you using sound therapy were you using something else tell us about the results you experienced and how you did it definitely so i was reluctant just being honest i was definitely reluctantcause i was just reading so many articles so many things like no its never going to godown youre stuck with it theres no treatment for itits too new of an issue people are really startingto have more issues with it ever since covid so i did realize that that is kind of something thats happening but i decided to go forward do it so i received the tinnitus maskers which really helped out a lot and i was also listening tosome white noise before going to bed that really helpedme put myself to sleep and another thing that ijust kind of did on my own which i thought was good was acupuncture i did find somebody to do acupuncture and he actually put needles around my ears which i wasnt sure if itwas going to help or not if anything it was relaxingi dont know if it helped so just relaxing breathingbeing more conscious aware of your surroundingstaking the time to relax and just take some breaths as frustrating as this can be the mind i guess justworks in mysterious ways so just kind of calming it down having the tinnitus maskers relying on you guys for guidance knowing that im not aloneand being able to talk to others really helped out a lot yeah im happy to hear that and tell us again what current levels of tinnitus do you experience lets use first a to scale of being very soft being very loud on average what are your levels right now in the last two weeks right now in the last twoweeks it has not fluctuated thankfully in a few months so i would have to give it like i said its definitely not ahundred percent gone so id say probably about a three okay and where was it during the most challenging timeshere in the past year when you were really struggling with this it was unbearable so yeah not going to beat aroundthe bush about that it was not good so i would say yeah i mean i guess it could always get worse so i would hate to give it a so probably a nine eight or nine i mean it was up there yeah well you mentioneda really important point that when you were researching online or maybe even talking to certain people even certain doctors theymight say things like hey you just have toget used to the sound theres no cure for it but if you knew what youknew now you would say okay when i said i wanted a cure i just meant i wantedit to get a lot better i didnt necessarilyneed it to go to zero and your case showed hey ifthis can go from a nine down to a three thats enoughto allow you to work and to focus and have a normal life again whereas even though itsnot completely silent and even though you probablystill wish it was a bit better its at such a levelbetter than where it was when you were reallystruggling more severely that this is the kind ofmessage that we want to share to the community and to doctors do you have any comments on that yeah i mean i thinkyou hit the nail on the head yeah ive had conversations with doctors ive had conversations with just people who arent doctorsand they have said to me basically learn to livewith it its not going away and thats when my anxiety really spiked through the roof too cause then you start going to dr google and you can go down apretty deep rabbit hole of what other people have done because of tinnitus andits not good laughs so i would say stayaway from those articles and it can get better so to the naysayers out there it can definitely get better may not ever go away but itcan definitely get better excellent i really appreciate yousharing your time martin looking forward what are your goals what are your goals moving forward and maybe thats hey everytime i go to a loud concert im going to bring earplugs maybe that is heyim going to still stick with my sound therapy regimenand my tinnitus masters because i want to see how much lower the tinnitus baseline level can get or other things that are maybe just about your overall health what are your goals here moving forward as youre now in thissort of maintenance stage of dealing with tinnitus yeah definitelythats a great question so i do still utilize my tennis maskers its not every day like i used to its every once in a while like you said im kind of curious how far down i can get it and not only that itsnot just curiosity its just sometimes i have to but again its nowhere near where it was and i definitely sleep still i like having the white noise or i think technically its the pink noise whenever i go to sleep i still do that every single night it just helps me go to sleep going to concerts i did go to a concert for the first time a few weeks ago and i will admit mytinnitus spiked tremendously and it took about four days or so for it to get back to normal so i did use my tinnitus maskers again i got nervous again i was a bit anxious and was hopeful that it would go back down thankfully it did so i would definitely be cautious about going to loud events and i love music i loveit love going to concerts so yeah just having those earplugs even in your pocket ifyou dont want to use them at least take them with you im definitely going to start doing that and utilizing those in the future excellent well for anyone listening you can find our team

years of migraines success story,in this video meet karen through the work of dr sarno and eventually implementing the concepts i teach daily in my videos,everybody this is dan with pain free you and today i am here with karen shes one of the viewers of my daily videos whether it was youtube or facebook shes been following along for a while and shes got a little bit of a story to share as to whats possible when you embrace this mind body reason for pain and start to implement some of the things that are being taught in this tms space and karen why dont you say hello and introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your journey with chronic pain maybe when it started and all the things youve tried medically and when you found out about this mind body space and kind of when things clicked for you and you got results and what over some of the differences there okay so ive been on this journey for years having been a dr sarno patient in but just to backtrack when i was so this was the s i woke up with this searing pain in my left eye headache i proceeded to then just live on back then what was popular was pure anal so strong medication through my s and that was when i was years old i remember distinctly being in a restaurant and i got this searing pain in my back now for the next three years i went to a chiropractor i had been in therapy dealing with some childhood trauma and i said to the group that i was with i dont know why i think this but i think that the pain in my back is all my rate and its just lodged there days later i know i just popped in my brain two days later someone told me about dr sarno no accident you know timing and to me it made perfect sense it was of course so when i went to him and i didnt share with him anything about headaches or any other symptoms really the headaches were always there the backaches were the main reason i had been going to a chiropractor i had been in down on my back for a weekend missing a thanksgiving and i had gone dancing and heels i was just assumed that that was it he said no hogwash that was his word he used a lot and he asked me about my life and he said you are a classic tms person again i shared a lot of my childhood and my mother died when i was a baby my other mother who adopted me woke up paralyzed one day she had ms you know i had a lot and so i went to dr sarno literally after his second lecture he had two lectures about the physiology and then the psychology and it made total sense to me and hes very matter of fact hes kind of group but there was something nurturing in his nononsense direct way sure and my back dates went away never to have returned now im i feel better at and i did in my forties i say that all the time i feel better at now than i did in my s oh yeah and i was always very active i was a skier every sport you can imagine so everything went away i would then call dr sarno a couple of months after the backgate went away i would call dr sarno with every element that would pop up the first one i remember was tmj he would say one thing it was reassuring it would go away he referred me for a small time to dr army who find black and her group i know shes been on all these and i remember interestingly i know if im getting off on a tangent feel free to just jump in if thats okay but i remember its interesting there was something about her that felt intimidating to me and i remember wanting to please her again a lot of things are coming to me now years later that i was like oh helps that group and i remember and all these instances are just proof to me that this work just i believe it i never knew why i never put the pieces together about the headaches till i found you and nicole on get to so i had to pin i had just moved from new york city to long island i remember hating commuting penn station for anyone who knows its not a pleasant place and i remember limping and i went to a toe surgeon or podiatrist and in a frantic way he said you must have surgery look at your toe you have rigid something and you have to have surgery otherwise you wont be able to walk in years years and i called dr sarno i dont know why i didnt think too and he said hogwash put your heels back on my tow pane is fine this was years ago sometimes it acts up but i know its tmf i got to start using that word how that must be the magic right well there is something about you that reminds me of dr sarno youre like the nurturing version of him okay because you have such a practical nononsense way so here i was years going to him just speaking once you were a patient youre always a patient and then when i had my allergies were always bad and i called him i was moving in with my now husband and i said why are my allergies this is a happy occasion clearly its also stressful never having lived with somebody moving to long island having to commute and he explained and he referred me to a tms therapist in manhattan that i went to for several years and she helped a lot and she said a lot of what you have said and for some reason i dont know why it didnt click again i guess you talk about this a lot you hear different things over the years and she would talk about catastrophizing and hypervigilant and you know all of that and that i would always be angry at my pain never me mom in therapy dealing with some of my childhood things so i was like im dealing with it but there was a way in which you guided me in a different way that again clicked so meanwhile now the headaches backtracking a little bit when i was in my mid s i think the limp started before the pain i started to have hip pain and it got really severe i went to sarno he said it was tms it got worse and worse and worse my tms therapist thought it was tms now dr sarno had retired so i went to the doctor that took over his practice and i begged him for xrays he said i didnt need it begged bag i could barely walk the seven blocks to nyu got the x rays the next morning he called and he said well you may or may not be tms you have severe orthosis you may or may not need a hip replacement so i didnt even think twice i had the hip replacement i was doing great three years in i fell and dislocated it so these headaches started to get worse trauma of the dislocation i dislocated a second time meanwhile i have dislocated my shoulders over the years so i didnt realize my body was in such this fight or flight and constantly freaking out over whats going to happen next and again im going to get to you and how you help coming of the nervous system and so two years ago i saw all the rage and at this point i was having these headaches every week they were only on the day that i had my one day with my husband which i cherished because of his work schedule i was like why would it happen on my one day and they would take me down for the day so with this i found you and nicole and i just cloud through your videos everything you wrote i remember one particular day and i dont remember the community that it was a really bad day and i dont want to tmi but i remember feeling this relief i was hysterical crying but i threw up and it didnt freak me out and i knew in that instance something clicked and i felt like okay i need to practice indifference but i cant get indifferent until i can learn to self soothe i think for me to sell soothing how to come first and little by little the headaches just dissipated and it just dawned on me a couple of weeks ago that the first headache happened for me very soon after my childhood friend had a very bad car accident and had a severe brain injury and i went to visit her and she whipped off her head scarf and it was very physical i mean her page was severe brain injury and her head was just not and i remember being startled and again i cant believe i just remembered that the first headache i had was very soon after that sure so in the past two years ive been obsessed with you and reading your material and the reason i love the videos you post is theyre not laden with all this language thats like what is he saying its so practical its nurturing its a little like come on guys the indifference the self soothing and difference to me is i had so many years prior of dr sarno knowledge and why the symptoms were bouncing around so there was one day where i was at work and i was having a bad day and it was early on in finding it was february it was new york it was freezing and normally i would have taken a cab either home to long island or a cap penn station and i was listening to you and i said no youre going to walk and by the time i was because you talk a lot about the walk and how it trains your brain and by the time i walked minutes i was fine and so you build these apps yourself into behavior and there was a day that i rode my bicycle for the first time in nine years because i was always scared of falling and what if i dislocate something and i woke up with a severe headache and normally i would have taken to the bed and canceled the bike ride and i just now i go back to you and listen to your podcast thats almost my accentra or i dont even beat myself up if i take an exception and i wanted to do this bike ride i was borderline canceling i was in the car with my husband and he was talking and sometimes i dont like to tell him because it just makes it worse he believes in all this and i remember saying to him shut up stop the ff talking and i did the self soothing the minute i got on the bike the headache went away so these things just right so its been two years this pandemic has given me the opportunity to really deep dive into this self soothe meditate every day i do some journals speak but im not obsessed with it the other thing that you talk about i dont feel the need that i always have to find out what it is right and thats so freeing trying to have years ago trying to figure out what it is cause me anxiety and so here i am i just turned and feel great and when i do get a pain you know dan ratner talks about this many of you in the community were human i used to get mad why am i still getting a headache now i have the tools that it goes away quicker so yeah thats my story alright that is very cool yeah theres so much that you covered there i dont even know where to jump in but i guess if i could just reiterate for anybody whos watching first of all just a disclaimer you know she said im a soothing version of dr sarno i am not a doctor i got to be very clear with that for anybody whos just coming across this interview here im a regular guy at years of pain myself i read dr sarno books i never met him personally i never went to him personally but read his books and it was infuriating because theres pages of whats going on and maybe a page and a half of what to do about it and i didnt know what to do about it so just to be clear im not a doctor im a regular guy who figure this stuff out through trial and error years worth of pain got better been paying free now for going on about years been coaching for a few years started doing daily videos i dont know about days ago and havent missed the day yet and just little snippets anywhere from six to minutes long and just sharing my experience of interacting with the community so if somebody will ask a question ill be like thats a good question let me record a video today for tomorrow and its almost like an ongoing dialogue so thats been great im thrilled karen is not a private client of mine i do some coaching ive got a group coaching program now the cars not even a private client she was able to just take snippets of stuff from the daily videos combined with what she already knew and implement and thats the key she was actually able to say im not going to get off this bike im going to ride the bike indifference means i dont care im going to ride the bike anyway whether i heard or not and it makes a difference because what youre essentially saying to your brain is im getting on this bike and the brain goes shes getting on the bike i guess shes okay and so the brain learns like okay shes safe shes not concerned shes not scared shes not freaking out shes going to do what shes going to do i dont need the headache to protect her and on that notion the reason i didnt do things for so many years is because i lived in fear about these dish locations so the headaches or all of this kept me safe or so i thought so when you push past it im safe yeah i dont know that its necessary to actually torture ourselves to push past it right because that can lead you to believe that if im screaming in pain i got to push past it no what it means is its more of a mental switch that you flip that goes living my life is more important than babysitting my pain or avoiding it right because this mind body pain disorder lives on fear and attention and what karen learned through experiences what im not afraid of it it leaves me alone and how many years of migraines have you had okay so years worth of migraines gone gone and to me that is just testament to the fact that once you have the accurate information you turn down your fear and you make living your life more important than fixing yourself things can get better in many cases quickly and the core message that dr sarno had when he first started talking about this stuff and one that i try to carry on is that theres nothing to fix right this tension myositis syndrome which is now the mind body syndrome which theres a number of different acronyms these days essentially means youre not broken and i dont think youre broken physically thats the key message from sarno but im also saying youre not broken mentally or emotionally either exactly because you had many years worth of therapy and you were still experiencing various discomforts and pains so it wasnt necessarily the therapy that fixed you it was the decision to say life is more important im going to do what im going to do anyway the indifference in that knowledge yes theres benefit to doing some emotional work for sure but thats not the only thing to do so in some cases its not even necessary exactly right because recently it doesnt sound like youve been doing a lot of emotional deep dives no let the dots and say oh i was stressed out about this right good enough thats all i need to know and then the knowledge and the belief dr sarno was knowledge therapy did his lectures in new york city it was like knowledge knowledge knowledge you can do this theres nothing wrong and ive heard funny stories about him talking to patients in his office and saying go live your life theres nothing wrong with you right essentially thats what im trying to tell people yes stop trying to fix yourself whether it be physical health or mental health stop trying to fix your and we didnt have this info you were around years years even years and how did you then learn so if dr sarna book didnt offer how did you learn trial and era figure it out yeah thank you i mean i had years of pain i knew about dr sarno for of those years and i would get better and then it would comeback get better come back get better and then we got worse and worse right people will say well dan if it took you years to get better how long is it going to take me you look at all you know same time out there was no facebook no youtube no podcasts there was no plethora of people out there talking about it and teaching this there were no tms coaches to my knowledge so when people say why did it take you so long and will it take me that long my answer is no youve got the cheat sheet youve got a plethora of information out there i had to make every mistake in the book right for years right me too and so the cool part is its not rocket science right its really not complicated is challenging because when youre dealing with physical pain or other symptoms its scary nobody likes to hurt or be uncomfortable or have symptoms or digestive issues immune system issues headaches or back aches or hip pain or whatever nobody likes that so yes its scary and pain is supposed to get our attention right its supposed to thats what its designed to do is protect us from something the brain perceives as dangerous when you can learn the accurate knowledge that youre not actually broken that your body is physically okay and teach your brain that the brain goes oh good we dont need the pain and for me i had to teach it with action knowledge but again getting on the bike that day that to me i have so much evidence now versus me going back in remembering my childhood whatever which im not a big fan right ive done it you know i have certain personality the other thing you could do and you guys talk about is really really accepting like when you surrender things happen in life for everything business relationships pain letting go of it so when i go for the walk anyway just teaching my brain you know what when i get in bed it gets worse its no accident that the minutes im walking is fine which is just for evidence like you said exactly yeah im very grateful that youre so generous with your time and your knowledge its kind of mind blowing yeah it was a challenge a buddy of mine said you know i think it was march of hes like well how do i build a community and he goes well just go on facebook live every day for a week see what happens it was march well a week of live videos turned into a bunch of live videos and then i said the quality is not good so then i got a camera that i was using and i just havent stopped its the type of thing where i just now its a pride thing its like ive been doing this for over days in a row now im like i dont feel like doing it today and im like i dont want to break that streak i grabbed the camera and i talk for five to to minutes and its not your full career i have a business that ive been running since which fortunately is an online business which doesnt really require a full time effort i can run that business in about hours a week which means i can get that income which allowed me to play in this space now in the past year as a result of doing these daily videos and building an audience without any promotion my one on coaching schedule is full anybody who wants to book with me is in august not july and as a result of not having availability for my one on coaching i said how can i help more people so in june i launched a group coaching program and an online video course which takes some of my core concepts and puts them into a video course that you can blast through in an hour and minutes as opposed to trying to dissect videos and figure out which ones to listen to its all in one place and i do actually weekly group coaching calls there might be people on the zoom call and they can submit questions in advance and ill answer the questions but every time i answer a question ill say karen your questions up next heres your question tell me a little bit more and it literally turns into coaching while other people are benefiting from the conversations and ive heard a lot of times that people will say you know what i learned more doing this than i would have with a one on call because i wouldnt have thought to ask that but thats very relevant to me yes and on some of the other podcasts there one particular therapist has sessions with a person four or sessions and sometimes i think what am i going to learn always learn something yeah you always watching somebody else go through it yeah and what youve said also another thing that i always remember certain things people say you dont have to listen seven hours to you or whomever i listen here and there no way im obsessed with this topic but its more for fascination then its with this fascination so i dip in dip out i mean i do listen every day to a little something but you know im not trying i have to fix myself like you said im not broken on any level right so hearing you guys talk about your ailments or your twinges that you get make it so real and relatable because sometimes you have a twinge youre human and thats the key there is no cure for pain but there is cure for chronic pain right i just had a question this morning which i have to answer on facebook and this lady was saying but then once you got through the pain the chronic pain does that mean you also dont have heavy emotions and i was like no there are two different things what ive done is taught my brain that i can have heavy duty emotions and stress and turmoil in my life but i dont need chronic pain right i can disconnect that and shes saying because ill always have stress ill always have tension ill always have this some family turmoil and kids and grandkids and worry and how do i ever get better if i still have an emotional life and im like well i didnt become a robot and have no emotions anymore i still have lots of emotional things in my life i am so glad this is recorded that last snippet im going to listen and relisten because its so important you dont need chronic pain just because you have emotions right only people who dont have emotions and stress are in the graveyard and i used to think i have to tie up everything in a box and be this perfect person whos not cook or its better for my mental health to not freak out which helps them not have pain yeah and again the medical health labels that people have been given right ive got anxiety disorder ive got o ive got clinical clinically depressed and all theyre doing is accepting these labels as defining who they are and many people carry those labels for their entire lives right which is why i try to tell people get rid of the labels medical labels you dont have fibromyalge youve got this mind body thing youve got cms too much stress right too much thinking too much fear do you think everyone on this planet has pms i mean i dont know there are true legitimate illnesses and right of course what the body does heal now look there are cases you break your ankle they tell you to stay off of it for three months and after three weeks youre going back running again there may be very wild cases like that that doesnt heal properly but thats like such a fraction of a percent right the body heals by all the time when was the last time you cut yourself in the kitchen and it did not heal or burn yourself and it did not heal it always does body knows what to do if we give it the right information which is ill be okay and so does everybody have tms i would venture to say that even the people that dont think theyve got an issue may have it intermittently guy i coached with last night he said ive had back pain on and off for the past years and hes in his mid thirties yes but it never bothered me it would go away eventually none of them were injuries its not like he fell and injured his back they were just probably an onset of tms but because you didnt freak out and go to the doctor didnt get the mri didnt wasnt told oh you better do this avoid that he was like im just going to get back to sports or ride my bike or jogging and he didnt come up with this perception that im broken it was just like my back hurt for a few weeks no problem this time its been lasting seven months and hes completely worried about avoiding movement hes doing all of the things so i think a lot of people have it whether or not it becomes chronic has to do a lot with our our emotional history and our amount of fear or medical fear or health anxieties and sometimes parents can teach us that stuff and thats another thing i grew up in a household where they freaked out and you know i was with my mother when she woke up paralyzed and that means pretty traumatic my husband i talked a lot about him on this but he is exactly this example when i first was dating him he fell off a ladder like on his back i came home his entire back leg but the whole thing black and blue i freaked out he doesnt he said it will heal and he healed she is years old hes pounds hes a capture on a hard ball team he competes against and year olds hes never had shoulder pain never had knee pain plays double headers in arizona and recently his back has been bothering him but his attitude is im not attached to it its fine im human and it went away and so its interesting kind of the universe gives me him to teach me these lessons but i see how he deals with it and its without freaking out and i always tell people and one of the things i teach in the course is pain happens for some reason true injury or an onset of this mind body tms stuff but it only becomes chronic if you apply fear and attention and he does either without the fear the body heals and it goes away because your husband has not taught his own brain that this is important ive got a major problem i cant move i cant and i cant do this i cant catch i cant throw it all i cant do it he just is like alright itll heal ill be fine if he feels the pain hes like whatever which is exactly difference which is one of the things that you said made the world a difference for you right and so its so powerful because when you say okay so i heard today no big deal thats a huge message of safety to your brain because im not worried about it you shouldnt be either and the brain goes oh you mean we dont need these connections to be firing yes so its really not rocket science right and i joke its not even brain science i mean it is brain science but you dont have to understand the brain science exact and attention make it chronic if you wanted to go away lets take away the fear and stop paying so much attention to it right exactly what you did when you jumped on the bike and said im going to ride the bike anyway you said im not afraid right without the fear it fizzles out like a flame with no fuel fascinating and just of course at the same time its bizarre i know it is fascinating ive been fascinated with this for years which is why even after i got out of pain i stayed involved i would learn i would read i have a whole bookshelf full of stuff about this psychology self talk about it yeah i still read about it i watched ted talks on neuroplasticity neuroscience pain its amazing how much or how little some of these pain experts on these ted talks actually know about not any of that yeah about opioids and im going no and i know you all my next turtle is i have to get over preaching to people that arent receptive and they just want to still buy a new mattress or get a cortisone i dont turn to zip it yeah and thats a challenge i have immediate family members who have in my opinion tms mind body stuff going on and theyre not accepting it theyre not willing to accept it or like my brother believes hes got tms but it doesnt really do anything to apply the things i teach and my sister has some issues and shes like its not all stress induced well right i cant help it im not going to force it right thats what i have to learn not just when to be quiet about it if you introduce somebody to the concept of mind body disorders or tms or whatever i find its useful not to start out with dr sarno theory of repressed emotions causing this because essentially people here im not crazy right im not stressed but i hear all the time im not stressed right but when you start to say so no theory which is repressed emotions are perceived as dangerous and your brain is protecting you from them by giving you pain and this distraction thing theyre going to go did you just call me crazy im not crazy this is real pain what are you talking about im not imagining its not all in my head exactly and its very offensive and people immediately reject i think its like you know its stress induced exactly its too much stress and stress absolutely affects the body you ever been stressed and youre tight intense right you do that for six months somethings going to start hurting so thats a lot more of an easy way to get into the dialogue in this whole repressed emotion distraction theory and thats helpful i think its always like are you under a lot of stress oh yeah my dog just died and my sisters got cancer and and its like wow you know a lot of times stress can build up their stress hormones adrenaline cortisol tension in the body and sometimes it can result in pain but then we freak out you go to the medical route and were told were broken because they found some incidental finding on the mri that says well you got a bulging disc here that might be pressing on an nerve now you think youre broken and now all of a sudden fear fear fear attention attention attention its chronic and you know years later its like how come i cant get out of pain there was nothing ever wrong in the first place other than tms too much stress right so thats that greasy slide that people fall down onto and then they keep sliding so thats why im just feeling very compelled to share what i share please keep doing it i mean i dont plan to stop at this point its a great opportunity for me to one my message and learn to explain it better and better and help as many people as i can whether they pay me or not if people want extra help yes ive got individual coaching if youre willing to wait four to weeks to get on my schedule you want immediate access to the little sales pitches you know ive got this online course immediate access the minute you join right and then weekly every wednesday i do two calls in the afternoon yeah seven at night and people can jump in and say dan ive got this going on or this is a question ive got my answer and we talk and these calls last for two hours and a half hours well its really been the last piece of the puzzle for me yeah so listen i really appreciate you sharing do you have anything else you want to convey or were pretty good yes were good just all of us im very grateful for you in this community well im proud of you for implementing im jealous that you had the opportunity to meet do in person hes the original guy i know oh thats great i really appreciate you sharing your experience with both me and the audience which ill be posting this online great its just proof years worth of my green headache right through the application of these concepts so it doesnt matter what your story is doesnt matter how long youve had pain what kind of pain whether it be back pain headache shoulder pain knee pain hip pain you know gastrointestinal problems autoimmune its all the same stuff yes full tms too much stress so i really appreciate you sharing that and i guess thank you anything else you want to say no im good thank you have a good day and stay connected youre going to inspire a lot of people with the years of headaches gone thats fantastic thank you bye thank you,1.0

jack mas life advice will change your life must watch,if you are struggling or having a hard time consider taking an online therapy session with our partner betterhelp,so years old dont worry any mistake is that income is a wonderful revenue for you so i tell myself and told my young people before years old be a good student where do intrapreneur just to learn some experience before years old follow somebody go to a small company normally in a big company it is good to learn processing you are a part of a big machine but when you go to small company you learn the passion you learn the dreams you learn how to do a lot of things at one time so before years old its not which company you goits which boss you follow its very important a good boss teach you differently and before from to years old you have to think very clearly were you working for yourself if you really want to be interpreted when youre to years old you have to do all the things that you are good at dont try to drop into the new area its too late you may be successful but the rate of dying is too big so to think about how can focus on things that you are good at but when you are to years old work for the young people because young people can do better than you so rely on them invest on them making sure theyre good so when you s over or so spend time for yourself on the beach sunshine right its too late way to change normally but i visit by by a device to the young people twentyfive years old make enough mistakes dont worry you fall you stand up you fall your step enjoy it im its only five years oh it enjoyed the show in do it i didnt have a rich father tried three times for university all filled i apply for however for ten times all filled theyd only want to see me for the last time i went to the teachers college which was considered the third or four class of my fitting to apply jobs of thirty times ill reject it it was so difficult at that time i was so frustrated because i taught in the university my pain was ten dollars a month because i could not find a good job in foot discussed that im going to do something called internet and of them i guess that they said this is stupid idea we have never heard by the internet and you know nothing about computer and i never thought i was smart nobody believed that i could be successful because everybody said well this guy thinks differently singer crazily you know they think about something never worked i try to borrow us daughter from the banks took me three months but i still cannot get it we talked over or venture capitalists everybody said no forget it a lot of people said alibaba is a terrible model as i said i believe it i think this thing could be big i never thought you will be that big like today i believe that something something is waiting for me there and i have to work hard to prove myself that was the tough experience so we gather us dollars from fighters we started for the first three years we do not have even one dollar revenue from our business whats not easy why it keeps the going ahead going forward because i received lots of email of thanks from the customers they say this is such a great thing we cannot obtain you but this things helped us if you keep on helping us one day you will be successful and i believe this little by little we build up our business little by little were good about ecosystem of the infrastructure and now after years we have a alibaba group who have a team or group we have a tarball group where we pay and people said you are so smart how could you make a company like that bill gates warren buffet the jack welch very page mark zuckerberg the difference between those people and other people they are always optimistic for the future they never complained they always tried to solve the problems of the others when youre up to mr its always opportunity people same here today jeff where is the opportunity i dont have a job i dont have this i dont have a debt we are at them back to time of the century the best assets you have is that you are young dont complain let the other people complain the opportunity lie always lies where people complain think about how you can make things different is there anything i can do that make the difference and then when you think about this study do it i saw a lot of people young people have a fantastic ideas every evening but in the morning they go to the opposite again being entrepreneur you have to do the things before the other people do you have to wake up before the other people wake up you have to be more brave than the others use your instinct everything you do is to the need of the customer to everybody to any person tomorrow is new make the move make the action whether investors believe it is or not whether your friends believe it or not whether your parents believe it or not thats not important you believe it your team believe it and work day and night on this thats how the things happens make enough mistakes you fall you stand up any mistake is that income is a wonderful revenue dont worry about the money money follow the people people should follow the dreams if you have a dream just to go ahead i think nobody can conquer the world we only can serve the world either work for the others or work for yourself and i choose the way work might for myself working for myself that means working for the society if you really want to work with yourself think about the others because only when the other people are successful when the other people are happy youll be successful you will be happy i think today people worry a lot about the world about the economy china economy in the world and im a very optimistic when people start to worry that that is the opportunity is but i worry about the blood testing and she created good things and i think great innovations great companys always happening in the tough times lives like the music you have a pivot down you have a longer shot nodes and i like the american movie life life is like a box of chocolate you never know what youre going to get right so im pretty optimistic the opportunity in the future for equality is huge because in the in in the last century the it is for big companies the globalization is for big companies but now with the technology we can serve those of the companies that never been served we can serve the of the young people that never serve technology for internet is so cheap so easy to use one of the reasons why we grow in china ecommerce so fast much faster than the us because our infrastructure of commerce in china was too bad why it is too bad something happening goes today we are working on the rural areas of china i can never imagine that china but million people still live in the rural areas of farmers and theyre about close to million people they are incomes less than one dollar per day and before the internet its impossible for these guys to reach the pc because its so difficult even people like me i dont know how to use in pc but now stand up the farmers those will be using mobile phones when have the mobile phones the internet the data things change it a lot so im excited about the future people always worry thats the you know i love the young kids sitting there and talking about the dream their hopes because if they have the hope we have the hope thats what i believe and lets just take what you do and i loved every description ive ever heard you about how you serve people and your story about the bamboo farmers and your wife and her friends its tagless but wheres this going what are you going to do what are your plans to maximize the use that people in remote rural areas of china can make of their cell phones besides ordering your projects how are you going to get it are you going to get them in the banking system through cell phones how well we we never know that we cant grow so fast the path to five miles we covered villages and these people not only they a using very traditional way that it takes them like two of we went to the rural area it took them the farmers two hours to work to the downtown in in the middle of the town and buy things but today because the mobile phone and we deliver we can deliver things to their home to their village within hours i remember theres a well last week i read a very interesting if this is chant amazing there is a girl she told me a story she said her grandfather years old birthday and for his life he always wanted to try one westernstyle food but he lived in the rural areas theres no such restaurant food so she said i tried on the internet booked a restaurant dinner for western food delivered to that village and finally immediately find one restaurant there are three guys they took like a threeday bus from the from shanghai to that village made a italian spaghetti and beef for them for the years old birthday and whole village was excited everybody says wow you can order food west westernstyle food so you can buy almost everything and also we are helping there a lot of farmers they plant love apples great apples but of the apples route it because theres nobody by allah they normally buy by track you know if you sell the the apples this our whole track and using a traditional way they can they can sell by whole basket of the apples but now because of the internet the sell by one by one each apple to sell o in a or for each so the farmers of the using internet they can buy and sell using a mobile phone that change their lives and i think its exciting and people need examples when they see well the other my neighbors maker made money through online to selling things my neighbor made you know by much interesting things online people start to learn and more people started by the mobile phones we cannot have we cannot make all the factory the mobile factories to sell phones to them only they know the mobile phone really works helping change their lives is to divide mobile phones just one more question and then do you think this will make the current problems like a current problem in china less likely that is if well have more market information in the market will drive where the investment goes instead of the government trying to make judgments about i better build another housing development or office development here there yonder and you wind up with a bubble well it comes from the bottom up is it more likely that fewer bad things will happen yeah they know i think the last week i was in seattle discussing about the china ah nummy i think the you american people worry too much about the china economy well you see every time where you start to worry about the china china goes better every time you think chinese are in problem you know were good you know well get better but we never say however you have a high expectation er trying to always a problem like a parents of the expectation of the kids you know at the same but theres a big difference between the american consumption because people say wow you know the economy is bad so china consumption will be good look no totally different you american love to spend it tomorrows money and the other peoples money maybe all maybe the kudus money we chinese love to save money we are probably the largest country under the safe deposit in the whole world that will people because weve been poor for so many years when we meet money were put in the banks because sunday we know the disaster is coming so we can spend the money so when the economys bad we still have the money to spend you guys probably dont you worried and the second thing is the china being if marketing china being focusing on developing for path to years china government so strong on investment so strong on exporting but they are too weak on the domestic consumption domestic consumption is not driven by governments driven by entrepreneurship driven by the market not the government so in the past two years past years government is so strong now they get a week its our opportunity its our show time to see the market economy entrepreneurship how we can develop the real consumption i think were if the china developed a great consumption we have a million middle class in next to years were going to have been a middle class we need to import a lot so when we start to import thats a great its going to i worry a lot when we act when we export weve got a terrible sky we have a terrible water we have a terrible environment when we start import we got to be better so thats all the great opportunity guys be happy about that im serious were that serious im them we worry about yourself dont worry the reason some of them to worry about china is we depend on you to buy our debt however i tried to be more chinese when i was president i saved a lot of money so good but i just wanted you to say that because i really believe that i mean i think youre absolutely right the trend toward greater internal consumption is i think will remain unbroken in spite of whatever the difficulties are in the next few months i think its important not to over react you cant break the trend youve got to clean up the land from chemical contaminants youve got to clean up the air youre going to do it and a lot of chinese will make a lot of money out of that therell be a lot of great new companies and theyll be opportunities to import from other places yes so can you discuss your theory of what youre doing and other things in terms of whether it advances equal opportunity and social solidarity tell them what you think is going to happen and what other kinds of when your opening remarks you just said technology is going to be active in this way in other areas of the economy what do you think the next big opportunities are but first tell them just in two sentences what youre doing because jack and i know and we havent been clear enough explain it and explain how you think that advances social solidarity and equality of opportunity our work is in the belief that access to health information is a basic human right and that lab information particularly because lab data drives seventy percent of clinical decisions im needs to be accessible to people before theyre sick so if you look at the word diagnosed in the dictionary today it says to determine the presence of disease from symptoms which means by definition were determining that people are sick once a disease has already progressed and our work is in being able to make lab testing accessible to people in time for therapy to be effected and to do that in a way in which every person irrespective of their insurance status irrespective of where they live can afford the ability to get a test done so that means in our case weve invested the last years in now developing hundreds of tests many of which are less than ten dollars so in two dollar tests in the united states and i think one of the amazing things about this country is that we have such an incredible ecosystem for fueling creativity and that creativity can create new markets so it answered your question about the market being able to conform itself to social good i think the creativity that goes into creating these new technologies creates new markets in and of themselves and and our basic belief that is that those new markets come from empowering individuals and in franchising individuals and trusting that individuals have the capability to engage with information and in accessing that information beginning to take control of their own outcomes and their own health outcomes and in doing so changing the way our healthcare system works i think what this could mean for rural china you know for rural india for native american reservations in america for the mississippi delta for the remote areas where all the jobs were lost from culture all of a sudden giving people information and one of the most important things i think we did and my second term as president and healthcare fund was developed as diabetes selfcare program and all of a sudden you could be jacks company could be delivering the means to selfcare based on your test i mean i think that this is really this is a very big deal we all want to live as long as well as we can and gregg benner was here we were joking about whether wed make it to a hundred but in the meanwhile do you want to keep people healthy and if theyre sick you want to intervene early not late yeah well and if you look at i mean the ability to engage with its information we have a four trillion dollar health care problem in this country of it is type diabetes which is reversible and we have million americans who do not know they are prediabetic but access to information and the ability to engage with that information is the foundation for being able to change those outcomes and and cost right one more factor than i want to call in jack you founded this company twelve years ago right tell them how old we were i was so dont worry about the future were in good hands okay i always think of a where i am have not the past examination for university yet i filled a free times but i think it were done im not a good of schooling well yeah thats why i give confidence to a lot of young people in china if jackie markhams success can be successful of that people can be successful people like her are jealous well equality i i would like to make a little bit cut technology helping because yesterday i was joining the united un women conference about gender equality and i think the first a technology revolution happened years ago in the uk release the human body their arms stronger the second technology revolution in the usa for energy you can last long but this technology of revolution relief release the brain so this century is not a competition who is strong whose muscles are stronger this who is a smarter who is up who can listen you its the challenge of a wisdom so men women equal on the internet you can never see hes a woman a man and on the internet women can serve much better than men on the internet and a man talking about a business talking about you know numbers competition to make business very cold women they make business very cozy lifestyle and interesting more than of our shop owners want to have five million shop owners of women and people looked at me this is this is a great thing i see that this century we see more and more women leaders on the state leaders the presidents and in the future were going to general scepter of your nation shall be a woman leader and this is the greatest century for equality and i feel excited about that when they ask you im were almost out of time but i one of the things that we havent talked enough about here and i just hear but generally is whether the leap frogging we saw with cell phones which was instrumental in your phenomenal business success and which will make it possible for you at the appropriate time to do what youve done on a global scale into unimaginable in all of human history for anybody to have any of their own health data we havent we seen examples but not the kind of dramatic penetration we need with energy and clean energy and enough and its short enough time to avoid the worst consequences of climate change so do you believe that i mean your country has done more than anybody else to try to put up solar panels and some of your companies when it broke because you overdid it right beforehand and you got to work out the phaseout of the coal the phasing in the sun and all that meanwhile africa which is growing like crazy because of the cell phone in no small measure and as six of the fastest growing countries in the world still has vast swathes of its land totally dark at night do you believe that its possible for us to scale up with distributed solar power is rather than centralized as quick as we did with a cell phone and if so and if that were your business if you had to quit what youre doing today and start there how would you do it and how would you do it at first i know that you know im such a huge believer in technology and i think especially right now were at an incredible time in terms of new technology and the ability to apply technology in a scalable way towards solving some of these problems so i would look at it in the context of some of the renewable solutions that we already have and in the context of empowering connecting individuals with access to those solutions in the context of creating markets around them i think that theres real opportunity to actually create an ecosystem in which people can financially benefit from these solutions and i think thats going to drive an adoption i think in developing economies theres a revenue stream associated with that and the more we can turn even already some of the technologies that we have into markets the more that we can fuel i believe local growth and individual engagement in in beginning to adopt some of these solutions just related it would be jack you answer and then ill ask you one final question yeah i must dont believe it the technology can make war much better because people say china economy is getting slower im happy about a even even of the gdp of the number of china the second large economy is big enough but you dont expect china keep on growing because like a one body one human body when youre meters tall you cannot keep on like a percent growth every year you have to grow the quality your mind of wisdom so i think china needs new technology to solve these problems and which today the data the the clean technology all these things that china is supposed to do if you keep on the tradition that the old ways will go nowhere but this is why i feel excited because people ask me what is your dream now because i never thought i would be today i can sit here talking to president im like a guy you know on the street and like fill the three times for university five times for high key schools i applied for times in harvard school or rejected i never thought because of the technology because the internet gives me this opportunity so i think when i retire i dont want the chinese people have a terrible water to drink and a save for food and people the money we make or spend in a hospital thats disaster so how we can using the technology to enable young people the greater chance of this world dont worry about we got billion people who are born in s they are the people of the internet times they are going to have new ways to solve the world problems the things you are worried about today because of it and a human being have these kind of worries for centuries and young people can always solve it and today we have a right direction clean energy you know the climate change all these issues they will be solved and these are the great opportunities ahead of us anything else i agree with that i think the more the more we can the more we can enfranchise people the more we can create ecosystems in which individuals are empowered than where we give rights to individuals to be able to build businesses to be able to to pursue the economic benefit of technologies the more you see these markets change before they leave the stage i want you to look at them and i want you to think about the time we have had to spend here dealing with the refugee problems in syria and lebanon stand up ellis this is my friend elias musab hes the education minister in lebanon hes got to educate all these kids and so he left a miracle that very much reflects the lives that elizabeth and jack have lived he was at a very responsible position at the american university of dubai they started bringing american scholars over there to live in an an arabic culture he did all these wonderful things lebanon gotten probably went home to save his country what is the difference how much more could he and every smart lebanese person do if they could focus on these things and why can he not because the place is dominated by people who think their differences are more important than their common humanity and their common challenges you cannot imagine jack miles proud of being chinese i like that hed never hit it hes happy about it out of product to be a global citizen yeah and i imagine elizabeth proud to be a blonde haired blueeyed american techno wiz from northern california yes but they dont not a word either one of them has said has defined the meaning of their lives or the direction of their work with negative reference to someone else my friend dikembe mutombo stand up no you dont stand up it hurts too much youre an old man my foot too rich fall friend was just inducted into the national basketball association hall of fame and the my family my whole family was and i have seen how much he is given back to his native country congo which has been told troubles ive known him a long time we both went to georgetown university i did before he was born i think ive never heard him say a resentful thing about anybody i have seen him give and give and give try to give the people in his native land opportunities why am i telling you this hes had a good life because he never defined his life with negative reference to anybody else he never regretted anybody elses success and he thought he had an obligation to help other people im telling you this is the we are back in a time of collective global insecurity where the main struggle is the oldest one in human history just in modern techno realities meaning if you were trying to build the middle east you would think about our permanent sponsor here the ambassador from oman who tried to her government tried to help head off a calamitous war in the middle east over the nuclear issue in iran we all pray to god that it will work out on and early to late you look around all these places wherever people are putting aside their differences and working together good things are happening we cannot achieve economic or social equality without living in the factional realities of the world we face looking at the obstacles looking at the opportunities making the best decisions and those of us who even feel good about ourselves because we think we spend a lot of time giving our whole goal should be to work ourselves out of a job one of the things that the bill and tani austin were sitting there with starkey they started giving away hearing aids and then they decided what we better teach these young people how to speak if they get the gift of hearing theyll have to learn that so they got into the education business sunny varkey got in the education business incited somebody ought to do something really dramatic to remind people that the only people that really matter the teachers so he gave the first global teacher of the year award last year and an international panel gave the prize to a teacher from maine who promptly gave the entire million dollars to her school woman never made any money in their life she gave all the money away immediately the future is going to be forged my people who think of how to use the modern tools that we are given as elizabeth and jack have to create opportunity through empowerment and it will not be a straight line its too too many moving parts and but i just want you to think about that the reason you feel good looking at them is that you identify with them even though theyre different from you and thats basically where we are all over again and we cant slip back we cant give up thats why we had the prime minister of italy and george soros talking about the future of europe and george said it was coming apart and the prime minister said no it doesnt have to come apart if its about something more than economics i thought it doesnt have to come apart if you will it not to and you put yourself on the line for it there are no guaranteed outcomes today but you can guarantee that the trend is right so go ahead and were going to say something which i just wanted to add i mean if were talking about the future and and from my own experience and looking at all the faces here i think a huge part of the answer to your question is also to raise our little girls with the stereotype they can be the best in engineering and science and math because when they do in all of these industries it changes everything and we need to do that in this country and we need to do that as parents in other countries yeah i was thinking about if what you say i think about when you want when you talk about problems you normally is like a politician we talk about opportunity opportunity that the businesspeople i was thinking about how we can using you know this all the problems that change the problem to come the opportunity and i dont know i just feel excited when people talk about problems i think thats think about if you can solve one of them thats the chance and today nobody in live in this century has so many opportunities and so many tools they can use the change other peoples life and i think in in the last century which i called it time this century is got a dt ten data technology it is to empower yourself make yourself strong dt is to empower the others when you empower the others you empower your future yourself so when i listen to talk i agree and i think thats why we were born in this century thats why we how we can use the internet to help more people its given my hand thank you,1.0
tms success story facial pain back pain nerve and joint pain,watch this great interview with john who overcame many kinds of pain with a tms approach if he can do it you can too,everybody this is dan with pain for you and today im on the line with john and john is one of the people who has a great success story to share and john i dont even know where you live where are you from well i grew up in wyoming i school spent my entire adult life up until two years ago in portland oregon and then two years ago i relocated to central texas austin specifically to live closer to family mainly my parents who fortunately are still alive that live in the houston area so technically im a texas resident but for the last year ive been camping full time or overlanding as they say so ive been on the road and right now im in the park city utah area wow cool my son not for a year he did a month long road trip and he camped and he saw like national parks inside of a month thats great he borrowed my moms meaning his grandmothers prius and in a day period put about miles on it thats great yeah if you have the opportunity to do it and certainly last year being like it was being out on the road and getting out in nature has certainly helped my overall well being very cool man so why dont you share a little bit with the audience here as to a little bit of your journey with chronic pain like when did you first kind of get hit with it what was your journey with the mainstream medicine world when did you kind of figure out who this dr sarno mind body tms guy was how did that journey go and you know kind of see if you can lead into a little bit of what turned things for you and helped you kind of break through because you know a little bit of where you were physically symptom wise mentally and where you are now which sounds like you traveling a darn country yeah living out of tents or campers sure take it away well ill try to be real linear in terms of my progression because i think that might be helpful for people at least it was for me when i listen to others journey over the last several years my introduction so to speak with what ill call the tms paradigm thats just the way i phrase it accurate i can pinpoint mine down to within the week it was the second week of march prior to that i was otherwise a physically very healthy no health issues nothing muscular skeletal nothing autoimmune i just was a healthy person it never had a serious illness or injury in my life i think thats important to say because the morning that i woke up in march of i went to bed feeling physically although i was dealing with some things which ill go into to waking up feeling metaphorically as though i had just been an automobile accident and hit sustained some upper body shoulder neck head and face trauma and that might sound extreme but thats what it felt like and so i knew intuitively well i hadnt fallen out of bed i hadnt been beaten with a baseball bat by an intruder i have a bachelors degree a bachelor of science degree in exercise physiology i only say that to let you know i have an understanding of the human body physiology and i have a good sense of my health and wellness and fitness that like something doesnt make sense sure but anyway and i didnt know what was wrong with me so before i get into okay now im hurting what was your hurting or not feeling good what was that what were the symptoms before i get to that let me say okay what led up to that that infamous morning in i guess i probably really set things into motion and maybe i was as the people in the community referred to masters i may have been hardwired for tms my whole life and not known it looking back on my childhood and some of the things i dealt with physically in i had gone through some life changes i had to shut down a business kind of oh wait when the economy went sideways i had owned a commercial coffee roasting company in oregon for a number of years it was large enough scale that my investors and i had agreed we needed to sell it it wasnt financially viable and i had shut down that business let go of a number of staff it was very stressful id add a serious relationship and at the same time and i was under a lot of financial pressure and i was at that time i was years old and then the next from to mid forties next years it was trying to figure out what am i going to do with my life now recovering from financial issues a lot of self loathing because of what i deemed failed business failed adult relationship a lot of personal issues that i think most adults deal with never never having it occurred to me that i was setting myself up for what led to and lets make it very clear that this is nothing you set yourself up for is there anything you did wrong its just where you ended up right exactly and i had no idea what was in store for me so im doing my best to cope with what life throws at you as an adult so the best i knew how with the support system that i had at that time but i think the takeaway is i had a good six well from nine to however many years that is being and what i thought was a pressure cooker of stress and anxiety that i had experienced before up to that point so for me january th of a month and a half before my symptoms had kicked in with tms my best friend of years a guy that i had gone from kindergarten literally we were in kindergarten together through graduating high school we were locker partners in high school we played football together is my very best friend a brother from another mother had left this world via suicide and i hadnt seen him which sounds crazy is him being my oldest best friend i hadnt seen him for years either prior to that nothing wrong with our relationship but its just the way life had happened and he was married at the time had a child he still lived in the mountain west in wyoming i was up in oregon and you know life see people so the day i found out about it that was the most unexpected thing i could ever imagine now i had lost family members and friends through more if you want to call it natural causes illnesses those types of things but having not been anybody intimately related to somebody who has either died from suicide or homicide its just my personal feeling on the matter and i believe that when you lose somebody close to you in either of those manners i think its unique not its harder but its just different its completely out of left field its a complete shock somebodys sick they eventually die youve got a little lead into it you can prepare for it he is out of the blue so i cant even imagine yeah so when i got the news i think for probably hours i was probably in shock but i hadnt broken down i hadnt cried i just was like i didnt feel anything i was just in awe yeah and i reached out to his parents i had talked to in many years as well and i had been very close they were like my second parents growing up i got all the particulars and for me that in my mind and i use it metaphorically its as though somebody turned over the hour glass or triggered the dominoes it said okay weve set into motion a set of experiences that you have never heard of couldnt conceive would exist this was just the way my mind was operating which was tms because about four or weeks later well a month and a half later obviously my feelings towards my friend dying were getting worse and it was multiplying the effects of everything else i was dealing with at that point what i had my personal possessions and storage i was living with an old college buddy of mine in a spare bedroom trying to pull my life back together in my mind i felt it should have been together im college educated at all the advantages and i was just i was falling apart and i didnt recognize how badly it was and then when i woke up that morning in march the symptoms i rolled out of bed i thought my jaw was broken i had extreme pain inflammation and joint pain in my neck and in my job my left ear felt fully clogged like it was clogged with wax plus titus or ear ringing i had deep burning sinus pain in my left nostril as though somebody taken a swab and jammed all the way up there and i had blurred vision in my left eye i have a pretty high pain threshold but i would say on a scale of one to i was at an eight like at a level of trauma like i just been through an accident i need to go to the emergency room and it almost seems unbelievable that i could have gone to bed feeling fine and then to wake up to that but that was what happened and i went through a day or two of that feeling talking to my buddy my roommate saying i dont know whats going on with me just trying to figure it out myself until i finally thought okay i need to go in to see my primary care doc and find out whats going on and this was my first step into dealing with the medical community on what was happening so i think anybody listening to this or watching this can you imagine how that conversation went and im sitting there my doctor came in the nurse came in told them my symptoms they did all the vitals everything and they asked me what was going on and it all welled up in me i ended up breaking down so much so that i ended up on the floor hyperventilating the nurse and the doctor consoling me making sure i can breathe all of that from the day i found out my buddy died in january had let loose and the doctor in this particular case wasnt too far off base he said hey john he goes this is clearly emotional because you didnt have any issues you didnt have no problem right he goes this is clearly emotional and i believe once you get a handle on that is going to subside but that was the extent of it i dont think this is an assumption im sure that doctor had never even heard of tms but this is the part where all of a sudden you know where this goes let me prescribe an antidepressant let me describe xanax and because by the time i got in there i had so much nerve pain in this upper area let me put you on i believe it was gabapentin i was on i believe zoloft xanax and gabapentin just like that and was told hey man you lean on your family and friends during this time this stuff will take the edge off until you get perspective and get your footing and it should self correct okay and that was it so i spent probably three weeks on that protocol and for me now this could have been imagined i dont know for me by the end of those three weeks i felt like the medication was morphing my symptoms into the symptoms were still intense they hadnt shifted yet it still that list of symptoms i outlined but now i have this despair that hit me that was more ominous than any ive ever dealt with now i had a history in my adult life of i never wanted to call it depression but it certainly was and i had had a history leading up to that of suicidal ideation prior to that friend of mine committee suicide or however you want to call that i was aware of that but i hadnt felt a real heavy presence of those symptoms prior to that and while i was on these medications and during that time there was definitely a shift in a three weeks of time i called my doctor and said hey i feel like this medication is making me feel worse im going off and of course he was adamantly opposed to that in a polite professional manner but told me his reasons why he thought it was inappropriate but i said im not going to argue with you how do i get off safely get off safely and he told me what to do and i made that decision i went in to see him one other time after that i promised to come in and see him a couple of weeks after id been off and told him i was adamant about staying off that but i did ask him im like im not convinced that this is emotional because now this job pain was in my molars my lower molars where i was convinced i had a jaw bone infection and so he suggested i go see my dentist and i had asked him i wanted to understand what was going on with me and he said to me and ill never forget it john it really doesnt matter what the root cause of this is our objective is doctors is to treat your symptoms so you dont suffer and so you can get better and that was just orthogonal to my belief system so i just kind of felt like were never going to be on the same page and thats the problem with the mainstream we treat symptoms we dont worry about what causes it we just treat symptoms which as long as youre doing that yeah and certainly a success is really small yeah absolutely and i get it hes not a counselor a licensed clinical social worker a psychiatrist so he never even made an effort to say hey ask any type of penetrating questions about what was going on other than this is obvious that theres emotional trauma you need to get it dealt with the only part im going to play in this is giving you meds to deal with symptoms and so from there i quickly over the next two weeks i should say frantically and im sure a lot of people who are new to dealing with this can understand i was in such a high level my level of eight now was at a im like i dont know if im going to survive this because i thought my body was shutting down its either that or im going to take my own life because im suffering at a degree i cant deal with this i went to my dentist told them all my symptoms in my job they took full sets of x rays no fractures no cavities no root canals needed i didnt accept that diagnosis and then i went to see an oral surgeon who basically said i dont know why youre here but i think to appease me more x rays and the consensus was there is nothing wrong with your jaw any of the hardware any of the teeth right so i didnt get into what had happened with me emotionally with them just the symptoms because i didnt want to cloud their diagnosis but it was basically youve got all this hardware pain but theres nothing broken right so now im like this doesnt make any sense then suffered in silence so to speak for another couple of weeks started talking with family and friends about planning my exit permanently thats how bad it had gotten and went and did the thing that everybody does i went down an obsessive compulsive google search rabbit hole right now look im not necessarily a proponent of that but its hard for me to knock it too much because had i not done that i would have never discovered which is the next step of my story dr sarno i was convinced after a few weeks from seeing the oral surgeon that i i had made a self diagnosis that i had an extreme form of fibromyalgia fibromyalgia kicked off all the boxes and im like okay and of course its perfect because nobody knows what causes it theres no known cure for fibromyalgia so i thought i had a death sentence is what i was telling myself keep in mind though as you know now fibromyalgia is tms exactly which i was going to get to jumping ahead sorry yeah no im glad you set it down because its so important when i came across dr sarno name heres the irony in it and you can take this however you want i had said at the beginning of this conversation i have a degree in exercise sense i worked in the fitness industry for nearly years in my first career a portion of that time i work as a consultant and educator with a corporate fitness organization based in portland it essentially works with large corporations and usually the head of safety for large companies to deal with work hardening programs on the job injuries joint injury prevention awareness et cetera so we dealt with a lot of industrial workers who deal with back pain and talk to them about how to stretch get in better shape so youre more resilient to those types of injuries in that progress and this probably would have gone back to the late during that time i unknowingly had purchased three of dr sarno books that were in my professional library because i had been referred to him as a back pain dock from somebody along the way but i never gotten around to reading them i never opened them whenever i grab a book draw it on myself and ill get to it so when his name came up and i read a couple of articles im like why do i know this guy and i started digging through boxes books that i had packed away in my storage unit and i had three of his books all along nice and i was like oh my goodness i read two of them and i dont know what order i read them i read two of them like non stop in two or days just back to back for me i was immediately convinced that that was what i was dealing with i needed no further convincing i get thats a big leap for some people i was one of those people in you dan no better than probably anybody what percentage of people might fall into that category i had acceptance of the information dr sarnos books were written in a way as a student an educator i could absorb and process and say this makes logical scientific sense and i had full buy in so i would say within days of reading those two books my symptoms and im making these numbers up so forgive me but i feel like i had a tent reduction in pain symptoms and anxiety symptoms you had an answer now at least you knew what was going on yeah so then you might say well okay you got a reduction in pain symptoms then what happened because now im into this thing maybe months this process but here was whats unique for me felt like i had identified what it was i was weary well whats the word i want to use i was aware enough to realize i should be careful who i share that information with its kind of like when you hear these memes or sayings where they say when you have good information keep it to yourself because outside energy contain things i didnt talk to my family about it didnt call my doctor because i didnt want any negative pushback from anybody saying well whos doctor sarno whats this about so i kept it to myself however when its a one sided book and you dont have a professor or a coach or other classmates to bounce ideas off and to drill down on the learning of the information the only thing i could do is re read the books so i spent the next few months rereading the three that i had multiple times taking notes trying to absorb and command the information but this is what i wasnt prepared for my symptoms then morphed within about three months all shoulder up pain gone as though it never happened woke up one morning and im like did i dream this gone i mean not even no trace im like is this the symptom imperative he keeps talking about it sounds too bizarre to believe i woke up with a different set of symptoms that were equally and im going to keep using the word insidious because ive broken some bones and i had a traumatic head injury when i was in college i got hit in the head with a brick i played high school football at a high level im only saying these things because im no stranger to get beat up and paint and this was the worst ever i started to have horrific lower back pain i had nerve pain that id never experienced in all my extremities that seem to be the worst or the worst at night when i was trying to sleep the nerve pain was throughout the day but it would amp up at night horrible low back pain where im on the floor legs up at degrees implementing all the therapeutic exercises i had learned in my fitness career and the nerve pain was both shooting stabbing snapping pulsing radiating my extremities and even in my genital areas male genitalia and anus which i mean thats never good right and im like what is happening and and then i started having what i would equate to what it must feel like to go through menopause for women horrible hot flashes and i would wake up in the morning in cold sweat having sweat through my sheets having to change my sheets over and over just soaking wet and these were the new set of symptoms that i had all at once happening simultaneously and that was my lot in life for the next couple of years and the symptoms changed to that from what they were initially i would say you know when i said that reduction in pain for a few weeks with the upper neck and head stuff after reading the books right went back up but in these new symptoms that i just tried to outline and those are the main ones that i can think of and so now im back up to living like an level where im planning my exit trying to re read and go over my notes dr sarno information im trying to get into my head to like relax and im going for walks and im revisiting my relationship with god i identify as a christian certainly a big part of my life i got real close to god because i knew that that was my only hope or at least thats what i believe in my core as a grown man if i dont get right with god i believe god brings people into your life i believe he brought dr sarno in my life im doing my best to deal with us but i had to go three years and the symptoms were pretty much those were my symptoms at that time i came across as i continue to study tms and do searches that time mr rosanna yes steve his name kept popping up and i came across another individual that seemed more hidden in the google searches but his name was monte huffle running an yeah and i had read steves book and im like okay it helped me psychologically but no change in my symptoms i reached out and talked to mandy one time and then he sent me a cd with with commentary and i would play that over and over when i would go for long walks and try to use some of his recommendations at that time i knew in my heart i was on the right path but i also knew in my heart i was talking right or i was connecting with two men outside of dr sarno that said hey you know we had long journeys with this and i had settled into the belief that if i dont die first by checking out not necessarily from the symptoms although i thought the symptoms were going to kill me that my lock life was going to be im going to be a year person if im lucky before i get out of this and i may never get out so as somebody who had a year journey with pain knowing about dr sarno and tms for of the years i can completely relate what i will tell you though is and for anybody listening i dont want anybody to get the impression that well some of these people have really long journey so i guess thats whats going to happen for me thats not true because these days not just me but theres so many other tms trainers educators doctors physicians legitimate clinical physicians podcasts youtube facebook theres a plethora of information out there that can fast start anybody whos learning about this stuff now i concur and we do have to take years to get better and thats primarily why im doing this ive been paying attention to this stuff since the years do i sit years to get better let me help you fast start it well and im six and a half years into it and i agree completely with you and i would want it for those listening i want to say the same thing and maybe i feel like im good at research so six and a half years ago i had not found dan six and a half years ago i hadnt found dr schumer it wasnt till i was three years in that i found mr rosanna and mr huffle sure and if i could have gotten all the way that i needed to just through the dr sarno books because as most of you know theres very few videos of him speaking theres some out there but theres very few theyre not comprehensive so short of what i was armed with with dr sarno there just wasnt the information out there and i admittedly at about the three year mark was trying to take some hybrid of recommendations from those three guys of dont make your life about this so i stopped doing research which i think was probably a good thing but i was still suffering and the pieces werent coming together and im going to get to the part where dan help me jettison forward ill call it light years and you can always say what would have happened had i had access and im not just trying to sing dance praises although theyre fully warranted but if i had had access to dans material in this format and this wealth of knowledge that youve amassed through the people that have come before you at that time who knows how long i would have had to deal with it and thats fine i mean we dont have to say phrase this year im just trying to you know capture as much of the story and give people a direction moving forward the whole long sarno journey i mean if you look at dr sarno books its like pages of what ms is and a page and a half of what to do about it and i think thats probably the most your brain thinks psychologically great the only conclusion i came to was i still have pain so i must not be thinking psychologically correctly or i must not be talking to my brain the right way yeah it was the only conclusion i could come to so i just kept trying to do more and more and more and its hard to do without im a big proponent of finding a mentor coach a leader right and i simply didnt have that after monte huffle information came into my life i felt like i turned a little bit of a corner and i started to see a reduction in overall pain but i was operating at a six to and i would have yeah and i would have a few days off and then a couple of weeks on of these flare ups and they were like waves and they were consistent they never stopped and it was the first time in my life i had ever had to live with chronic pain still dealing with the same symptoms i last outlined but now the symptoms were beginning to morph again now i was having tonight is both years i was having super dry irritable eyelids i started to have wasnt dan drove because i asked my dermatologist but it was almost like super dry skin to where it was almost like a dermatitis that i never had on my head before and i have it for a few weeks then it would go away for a couple of months and then a couple of old injuries that i hadnt had for more than years any issues with those i started having like phantom pain it was real pain but id call it a phantom pain because i had a knee injury in college all these years removed it started hurting in the same way as though i just had it and i hadnt even done anything but go for a walk i knew i had the symptom imperatives number i knew what it was so i could kind of laugh at it but it hurt like heck so now the symptoms are moving a lot and when i would at this point share that with my family a little bit namely my parents what was going on the shift of symptoms and the extreme of the symptoms and then the newest one was the ibs was so intense and so random thats where i lost everybody in a potential support group because then it almost seemed like johns theres some issues there and were letting you know hopefully hes getting counseling hopefully but maybe hes having a midlife crisis but my credibility at least i felt this way as a sane rational person started to erode over that six year period and i was in austin texas end of i just moved there and again living at this point is about a level six of pain and inflammation and discomfort and maybe my six is another persons nine i dont know but i was not doing good is my point and thats when i came across you for the first time on youtube and basically for a full year so all through end of all through im sure ive watched every youtube video you have and i just just absorb them i didnt obsess about them i would bookmark ones that really resonated with me and you and i are similar age and that was just important to me im like okay ive got somebody thats kind of like me that i can relate to and i finally decided q one of this year hey im going to book a call dan we had a call nothing you said to me was a surprise but it was like it was almost like being able to talk to dr sarno for the first time in my life it just was a big boost of morale if nothing else all the information was great you were generous with your time when i hung up the call with you you provided me with a lot of information that i could go through on my own time and you said dont pressure yourself with this and i slowly worked through a lot of it and i just kind of wanted to see im a big advocate of letting this information wash over you marinate whatever metaphor you want to use and lets see what happens well i would say within that first week or two i saw a drop in discomfort and im like this is great and i was optimistic maybe almost even cocky that im like this is going to be it this is the last bit that i need to push me over the hump and i bet ill reach out to dan in about three months and im going to be good i just have that kind of mindset about it about a month after we talked i know dive and it was like i was as bad as i had been before finding you a year and a half before and im like whats going on but the difference is i didnt panic and i really had to step back you know i believe that this whole thing operates on a macro and micro level the micro level the symptoms the pain the maladies that are hard to get past the macro level is for me the two things i have been guilty of that really fed this thing is the ruminating information that im telling myself and the catastrophizing and i once read a book many years ago after college it was one of my professional reading books a book written by an author named shad shad helmstetter what to say when you talk to yourself and i think a lot of thats in there about what am i saying over and over and god knows what my subconscious is telling me i say it often we believe the things we think and say most often and so i think my ruminating and catastrophizing were predicated on the two core emotions that i think for me that ive identified through everything ive learned from you dan and everybody else for me anger and fear were the two pylons or pillars that all of this is about and the subset of that anger and fear thrust me into sadness it benign in the most benign way but for me because i continued with illuminating the catastrophizing the sadness im going to go down to depression okay went to despair and theres a big i always say imagine being in the north atlantic in the middle of the night in multi thousand foot seas treading water with no life jacket thats the analogy i use for the despair and then the next level which ive walked that line which is hard for me particularly because i now have had two friends that have died from suicide obviously one of them being my best friend is the suicidal ideation and knowing that not so much that i dont want to live its that i cant live like this any longer and i could not get out of that loop and i was like you and i certainly was glad when you said journaling is not necessary and for you it didnt work i did very little journaling but i did a lot of talking to myself out loud and in my head in my daily walks and a lot of it was prayer format others it was just kind of like this format or venting and i verbally journaled my way out of it and i had to take a hard i had to do an audit of myself as an adult that was tms revealed me and i was not happy with what i discovered and i went through an extended period of low self esteem being thin skinned self loathing about things that i didnt know how far back they were going to go i thought i did a quick inventory of the past stuff that dr sarno talks about but i revisited some things and i think it was you dan that talked about it made less its likely not so much about some hidden thing that happened to you when you were five sure its whats going on in your life right now and in my case sure there were some things in my past but i was able to clean those up within a few weeks especially if youre an introspective person i know plenty of people that arent i feel like i had an advantage for me it was how it was my perception my paradigm of my day to day life prior to my friend dying and after my friend dying that was perpetuating tms in my case lasting as long as it has so thats essentially my story obviously you can go down a rabbit hole on the various symptoms that people have i certainly think theres maybe its an unlimited number of symptoms that can be associated with the symbol anything that can happen medically the brain can create as wise thats the case and i intimately experienced probably to symptoms at a level i just didnt think possible and there were times i thought i was possessed so where are you at now so this is the important takeaway like you were alluding to a little earlier about hey dont misunderstand where johns going in his story it doesnt have to be this long i had emailed you a few weeks back in my because you checked in on me and im like dan you know i went up just for a little bit and then i dropped and i was going to ride it out a little bit and i had booked another call with you and i had to wait a little bit because you were busy and i was fine with that because i was doing my thing and i wasnt freaked out about it and then all of a sudden it occurred to me i had had like three weeks of light hey man im like barely my thing now at this stage is the first to minutes when i get up in the morning im uncomfortable and its a variety of different things and then after about minutes and by that time i usually had my first cup of coffee and no its not the coffee things calm down right and i feel pretty good for the rest of the day and if somebody said well what your pain level at now maybe its a one i feel like and im going to use the phrase remission because i dont know what to say but if i were to think of it as being in remission from a horrific disease lets say im in remission theres some vestiges and maybe there always will be but i know what it all is im no expert but im an expert on me i know what it is i dont live in fear and the stuff that im working on in terms of my own thought and belief and emotion feeling life is stuff i needed to work on anyway i wish it wouldnt have been pms that would have led me there in some ways but i know youve said the tan and ive read it from others in some ways and its hard to believe this when youre when you feel like you need to be in the hospital but in some ways tms is a blessing it was hard for me to buy into on some level that my brain is my friend and not an adversary because it just felt like an adversary and theres an element for me that i thought i had to self parent and occasionally if i was sitting on a bench hurting i rub myself on the back of the head like i was a football coach talking to one of my athletes that was upset or a kid saying hey buddy you know i get it man but its okay and im here for you and its not silly but it doesnt sound silly at all because it helped yeah i mean when were dealing with this level of symptoms and pain and discomfort and fear and despair we need somebody to tell us its going to be okay we really do i mean its tough to come to that conclusion when youre in the thick of it when youre suffering that badly and you dont see a way out or youve been in it for so long so i dont know whats going to happen how am i going to get out of this and i think its really important to be able to go hey come here john alright bud youre going to be okay and not to toot my own horn but thats what those daily videos do i show up every single morning and say hey youre going to be okay heres another something to think about but you can do this youre going to be okay literally shot a video for tomorrow morning it says be the hero of your own movie a lot of what i do is accurate knowledge information tactical strategy what to do but a lot of what i do is offering hope and its not false hope its accurate hope its like you know if you can convince your brain that youre actually okay and that being uncertain about your financial or career future or being uncertain about your relationship status or where youre going with that like you know im i get it you know i just had a relationship end and so you know im sitting here going alright what am i going to get this right so you know i get it well i think the message of hope and that might sound cheesy but its true look i wrote you a personal letter that i sent to you email prior to this call a few weeks back and im sure you get a lot of those and i think anytime somebody reaches out to a mentor or what have you people will pour themselves out and i tried to do my best to express my sincere gratitude for all that youve been as a conduit of information and hope for people and i know if theres anybody listening to this that is where i was or god forbid worse in their own journey or wondering about this stuff like as i said earlier if dan if i had had access to dan when this started somebody to help me understand that this isnt a life sentence isnt and that things like fibromyalgia fall into that tms bucket and its unfortunate that mainstream medicine hasnt embraced this because not only are you hurting and suffering but then youre dealing with everything that goes with that maybe nobody believes you or that theres no obvious path forward i can get where people out there that are cynical that might just is too big of a leap of faith you know and i would challenge anyone to give real serious not put pressure on yourself but get real serious about showing up for yourself and remembering youre the prize and you need to know that you being happy and feeling good is what matters and there are strategies to make this happen and this this paradigm that is tms from my perspective the good news is dan talks about this all the time is youre not broken youre not sick and most importantly its not your fault it just happened and and you can overcome it you can survive it and and you will stay the course yeah so you made a statement a second ago you said a leap of faith and i try to clarify that because this is not false hope its not a leap of faith its a leap of accurate information absolutely sorry ill put this stuff out there years ago in the and theres been so much evidence that this mind body cause of pain and continuance of pain right we can learn to keep pain going or symptoms going just through fear and the attention we give it the catastrophic thoughts all of those things and so theres brain science theres clinical medicine behind this stuff so had however many decades of clinical experience one i think this just woo woo think your way in free this is legitimate how the brain works how the system works and when you have the accurate information what happens to your fear it starts to dial down and when you are no longer afraid youre able to kind of shift your attention back towards let me kind of design and create a life that i want and when your brain gets the impression that wow john is not focused on his symptoms as much anymore i guess look hes doing normal stuff i guess hes okay and the whole system can really settle down so its not a leap of faith its not blind faith its not just hoping a prayer its legitimate real stuff and i do everything i can to simplify it into the shortest half possible and the core message you said it a minute ago youre not broken right youre not broken physically mentally emotionally your brain is your best friend its not here to punish you or torture you it seems that way it certainly can feel that way when youre in the midst of it but when you realize the brain is doing everything it can to keep you safe and keep you alive and its operating flawlessly but just with bad data bad data is you cant handle your life circumstances failure of a business the loss of your best friend the loss of a relationship who am i where am i im a failure how did i end up here right and your brain says you cant deal with this stuff so lets give you something else to focus on and heres a bunch of really crazy scary symptoms yeah and when that was going on you werent thinking too much about all your life stress just trying to get through and figure out now how do i make it through the day yeah go ahead i think into your point on the leap of faith comment i think for me using that phrasing it would be speaking to myself to somebody like me in those first days if somebody would have said to me hey john theres an md in portland thats a specialist in this mind body imperative condition you need to set an appointment i said md so it was like its scientific or hey john theres college graduate level textbook written by a group of mds on this topic even with them knowing that the science is there the leap of faith if you will for me would have been more a leap of faith to go talk to people that can help you understand this scientific close to it yeah not that getting through tms or past tms is leap of faith type of thing i just want to be more clear on that thats fine the fact is that a lot of people hearing about tms for the first time are like im not listening i have a real problem what do you mean mind body what do you mean my brain is creating i got a real problem and thats my point because the first timers thats my point i read a lot of the comments in your daily videos so thats why im kind of speaking to those folks because i hear people say well then i get that this applies to these people but for me and i guess what i would just say if it was a live chat id say take a leap of faith and listen to dans information youll find out that theres a scientific reason for this the leap of faith is be open to listening to dan or doctor starter was alive listening to one of his lectures and reading one of dr shiners books thats the leap of faith and its not just me theres a lot of really good experts out there and i think the people who are coming upon this information now are blessed compared to me coming upon it in the late i tell you what man there was nothing no facebook youtube podcasts none of it there was sarnos books i think dr sofar had written a book there was a tms help dot com which was the old style bulletin board right was that the wiki thing no it wasnt even the wiki yet for the wiki okay and so there wasnt a lot when i was going through it so i just do what you did keep reading arno and keep daily reminders and its frustrating as hell because youre like i know whats going on how come im not better right and then you read in sarnos book you know the people who read the book and got better and youre like why not me and it can be really frustrating and what im suggesting is the more frustrated we get the more in despair we get the more we focus on it the more we spend time trying to fix it farther away were pushing it you know its like being underwater and seeing like a leaf floating underwater and you go to try to grab it and the water kind of scotches the leaf away from you or like a beach ball trying to hold it under what sometimes the harder you try the farther youre pushing it away because the brain is interpreting this desperate need to fix yourself as youre in danger and really what this is all about to me is consistent messages of safety im okay im not broken i need to calm sooth down and yes life stress will still happen people will be like oh danny how did you deal with this this and that and how do you get rid of all your stress well you dont so what do you do with your emotions you just push them to the site no you dont do that either the key is we just need to teach the brain that those things are not dangerous so i still need a very stressful life full of emotions but i dont have to hurt and that was the last variable if somebody said well what was the last nugget that you took from dan that kind of puzzle piece if you will i would say that was it for me and i watched a lot of your videos where you specifically talked about that im like okay im still dealing with some unique stressful things and im still not where i want to be in terms of certainly having lost my friend and some other people close to me how can i get over my tms stuff well thats still going on and is that possible and it was the reassurance and the repetition of your comments on that particular variable in the equation that i feel like were the final pieces for me for whatever thats worth life is not perfect and thats okay yeah stress is not dangerous unless you view it as because there are so many and youve seen the comments that people are saying but ive got this going on and this going on and how am i supposed to get better with these things still going on you dont have to change your life to get better you may want to reframe how you interact with your life maybe see things a little bit more from an acceptance standpoint right im just going to embrace i was going to ask you that because you you talked a lot about especially when youre having a flare up embracing or accepting your situation and for me it helps where you would say it might be more favorable to you to save yourself that im uncomfortable today then use other adjectives to describe what youre going through that self talk for me as a little say hack made a big difference im just like yeah im more uncomfortable today and i would sit with it and i would do that coach pat me on the head saying hey john but were in this together and youre fine buddy and that would calm things down youre parenting yourself youre basically soothing yourself as if youre scared four year old kid and i know that sounds really weird and maybe a little hokey but honestly when youre in the thick of those symptoms we are scared we are scared and we need somebody to go come here but i got you man youre going to be alright its temporary these are sensations theyre awful sensations they dont feel pleasant at all but theyre just sensations and i try to point out a lot i joke with people im like look as bad as the symptoms were you know all these weird symptoms in your hands and your feet you never woke up and once found your hands and feet on the floor we dont have things falling apart they are just sensations theyre horrible theyre stressful theyre scary but theyre not damaging you dont leave permanent things like dr sarna used to say theres no permanent damage as a result of tms we dont fall apart physically as a result of it we can hurt as bad as you could ever imagine and at the end of the day youre still okay so i like the word sensations discomfort those are better than attack im having an attack of pain well that certainly isnt going to teach your brain that youre safe youre being attacked yeah youre feeling these uncomfortable sensations and theyre temporary its a lot less scary than this attack so you have anything else you want to add no i appreciate i mean you had a hell of a ride what i will suggest to you i dont assume youre going to wake up with these sensations like you said the first minutes youre saying that its a little bit tough until i get my day going when you wake up instead of going alright just get through the first minutes start visualizing waking up feeling great comfortable start to teach your brain that thats possible because for right now its almost like theres this expectation that well the first minutes is going to suck but after that im doing good and given where you are thats amazing and youre saying thats awesome i can deal with that i can live with that what start visualizing what it would be like if you could wake up and feel good if you hit the floor and youre okay because thats still possible your brain just still believes and expects well the first minutes is not going to be fun but youll be fine and keep going which is great which is like a world of difference compared to where you were and would you call that thats a thought habit that ive gotten into thought habit its an expectation dr hubner uses the term predictive coding whatever you expect the brain can literally create it out of thin air its not because your body is needing to get moving and circulate some blood its not a body thing its the expectation that im going to hurt for the first minutes so why not set an expectation that youre going to feel great because if you look if you can feel great later in the day its not a body thing right body is fine and if you can get of the way better proof its tms and its also proof that you can get right dont set this limit that ill always have this little bit no dont make that decision in listening to these decisions that youre making and if youre deciding that im good with and im okay with it this way not to say you should get mad at it or get frustrated with it but just think of the possibilities wow i got rid of of these symptoms that means i can get rid of all of it thats the message of optimism and clarity that you want and start visualizing that positive outcome and so you know if you do experience discomfort tomorrow morning when you wake up okay so what indifference the less attention you give the symptoms the more the brain realizes theyre not significant we dont have to worry about them youre not in danger so hopefully that makes sense absolutely and i appreciate that thats a good reminder and to do good stuff for sure so im going to invite you to keep me posted over time drop me an email if you have questions hit me up okay the way i work with the coaching clients and we only did the one call right in april i think it was yeah because i ended up canceling that second call because i was feeling good and i did it well in a few weeks in advance no problem and you wrote me back and you were like hey john this is great news and keep rolling so it was all good stuff and you were great about it and so ive just been writing that and that was about four weeks ago so its been good thats awesome well for anybody watching johns a prime example of going from you know the deepest darkest pits of despair to getting his life back and it really seems like reading through your emails the first one the second one literally getting your life back and actually having a view that says i can start planning my future and start thinking about what does john want to be when he grows up as opposed to will i survive tomorrow hell of a difference man i dont know if you give yourself some credit for having the the courage the belief the sticktoitiveness right that just the commitment to yourself because you wouldnt have gotten there if you didnt think you could do it or if you didnt have the commitment to yourself and believing that theres a better future there for you so like kudos to you man i know i may have pointed the way but you were the one who had to take every step thanks so i really appreciate that and ive already said it before privately to you im grateful for you in my life and im very humbled man stories like yours are what keeps me going on wanting to shoot these videos and do the coaching and all that kind of stuff so for anybody wondering john hooked up with me through my website dan bogle dot com theres a coaching link in the get help menu but also for somebody who wants a little bit more help because the one on coaching is great but i also now have an online course like a video based course with weekly group coaching sessions where people can submit questions in advance and have me answer those questions on the group zoom call very similar to this but instead of faces on the screen there might be or and as i go to answer the question that was submitted early ill go okay susan unmute yourself and then ill talk to susan and ill answer her question well interact for minutes and ill go to the next one and it literally is coaching its not just me reading questions and answering and everybodys silent so thats an option as well you can go to pain free you com and look for the course a coaching menu item at the top and thats an option as well and well give you weekly support so for anybody who really wants a little more hand holding than a one off call thats an option as well john was able to benefit by the one off call plus i do send off an email with a number of resources which is kind of like an online course delivered an email but ive really had to because of my lack of availability in the one on calls i said how can i leverage this and help out more people so in june i started doing the group process and created that course and lot of the things that you and i spoke about on the coaching call are now encapsulated into a video course which certainly is a lot easier than having to go to the youtube channel and figure out which of the videos you should listen to for sure listen man i really appreciate you i am humbled by your kind words i am inspired by your results and your is your commitment to yourself to get better you probably realize it i feel better now at than i did in my early thirties and thats what your future looks like just know that your body is already fine you just got to keep your mind your brain that until it leaves you alone and i say that and i realize that had a negative connotation your brain is not attacking your punishing you i dont mean in the way that you need to get your brain to leave you alone you just you just need to teach your brain that youre okay and when it believes it its going to have you focusing on more important things like life so unless you got anything else you want to add john im good to go i appreciate that note and again thank you and i hope that for those who are listening if anything that i said resonates with you having people like dan in place to serve it as a conduit of information education mentorship i think is important and im always going to add a little bit with my spiritual belief however it is that your spiritual life works for me prayer along with this and just keep my mind and gratitude just made me feel better about the information i was getting that as long as i remained faithful and hopeful that the light would be restored in my life and for me that has been completely true thank you thats awesome john again thank you im going to go ahead and hit the stop here okay thank you i appreciate you you bet,1.0

shes a family for with little hearts ive been so lucky to have you as support throughout this journey firstly with your videos on youtube providing me with hope and a sense of empowerment then with our consultations that meant so much to me i remember you had the word hope in the background on our calls right there before i thought hope was a weak word as believing in something not very likely to happen but i realized it was the feeling my interactions with you provided and this hope turned into gratefulness when my desires came true i want to thank you for being an expert in the in these things and for sharing what you have learned with the world i hope i may be an example that you can mention if you come across other women with low amh warm greetings from rome so in this video im

use and so to find out if youre a good candidate youve got to apply use the link below to apply for my fertility program okay so lets talk about lina so im going to look down on my notes so that i can give you all the right information because i cant remember everything about her case without looking down at my notes so lena went to go see her gynecologist and she was told that she had low ovarian reserve or limited she used the word limited but im saying low ovarian reserve and her amh was low so what she decided to do was to freeze her eggs and so she did two rounds of ivf just to save some of her eggs so she had that as a backup and she had limited response because thats what often happens when your amh is low and so she only got three eggs per cycle her menstrual cycles were a little bit irregular to days we prefer them to be at days and she was dealing with a lot of stress stress that she put on herself because she was trying to achieve a lot through work and the stress normally that is achieved through working hard and so this caused some adrenal dysfunctions for her okay additionally she had spotted for two to three days prior to demonstrate her menstruation which we dont ever like to see and she was having uh frequent utis throughout the year and so aside from the ivf cycles we ran her lab so we know she has low amh she also had low vitamin d her homocysteine levels which is an inflammatory marker was a little bit elevated and so we needed to start making some changes so the first thing that i did is i ordered a dutch test for her because i wanted to dive deeper into her hormones and get a better understanding for what her hormones were doing and how we needed to influence those hormones to get better results for her so we started with a dutch test in the meantime i did put her on a few supplements to hopefully raise some of those levels one of which because her vitamin d was low was we gave her vitamin d as well she did mention before i go into more she did mention that her libido was low her immune system was compromised she felt like she was getting colds a lot she had cold sores and so this starts to tell me a little bit more also about her immune system and how her body was functioning and her overall health so i know all of you are always asking about what supplements you can take to improve low amh right and help out with your with your ovarian reserve and egg quality well a lot of my recommendations are going to be very very specific to your needs your specific needs and so im not going to go into all the recommendations i made with her because theyre not necessarily appropriate for you i will mention again that one of the first things i did was increase or add in vitamin d for her which i thought was very important for her overall health her immune function and for increasing her amh levels additionally i did put her on coq i do think all of you who have low amh and need some support there can be on some coq and should be because theres a lot of research around that this is my favorite coq its called neoq right here and im gonna put a link below so that you can check it out if thats something that you need this is a high quality highly absorbable coq and its my favorite one to recommend for all of you watching so you can go ahead and check that out with the link below so coming back to lina im not going to go into all the details about her case because wed be here for too long but after working with her three months into it she started to see results her cycles were more consistently days with much less spotting she reduced from three days of spotting to one day of spotting her energy was increasing she was feeling better and so we made some additional adjustments at that point and six months into working with me she emailed me with her first positive pregnancy test that shed ever gotten and she didnt have to use those frozen eggs that she had saved right so she got her first positive there she held that to full term and carried and delivered a healthy baby she reached out to me about a year after the birth of her first child and wanted to start trying for a second but as typically happens is your body is very different after a pregnancy and after delivery and certainly after caring for a baby for a year so we have to reassess her health and make sure that shes in tiptop shape and address what we see at that moment in time versus going back to where she was when she first started with me thats a common mistake that happens is we assume that the same issues we had the first time are the same issues we have now and thats not always the case so its important that you take a step back you reassess your overall health and treat what you see which is why we did another dutch test saw that her dhea levels were low some other variables and hormones were off we addressed those things and she got pregnant again with her second delivered november and thats when she sent me this email so i want you all to know that the potential and possibility for you to improve your health improve your amh levels are there so if youre looking for more information on amh i did this video right here in wow it was such a long time ago yes i do look a little bit different but the information is still very very important and this video is what does fsh and amh really mean so i want you to check that out ive also done several other videos on this topic of amh that im going to leave links for you below so that you can check them out as well how to improve ovarian reserve and get pregnant

why pete townshend s tinnitus success story is so important,unlock lasting relief from tinnitus schedule a free consultation with treble health today pete,who has tinnitus he has tinnitus ringing in the ears lets put an image up on the screen to see pete townsend today how he looks and now another image to show him back inhis prime rocking out thats much better i love that what im here to describe today is the importance of tinnitusringing in the ears loud music and concerts pete townsend has been strugglingwith ringing in the ears whats also called tinnitus what medical doctors and audiologists would refer to as tinnitus pete townsend has beenstruggling with that for a number of years in todays video illcover the back story why its important andwhether it will affect him for his future musicaltours and performances my name is dr ben thompson audiologist tinnitus specialist based in the united states and dedicated to the tinnitus community maybe you have been toa loud rock concert maybe youve been to a concertof any type with loud music and youve left that concert having a harder time hearing thats called temporary threshold shift and it happens when youreexposed to a lot of loud noise in this case loud music ive gone to many showsand right when you leave youre stepping out of the stadium or the auditorium and thenyoure having a harder time hearing people around you ive been there thats calledtemporary threshold shift and that means its atemporary hearing loss that can also come withtemporary tinnitus or ringing in the ears and the next morning most of the times that returns back to normal however if you repeat this over and over and over and over you can have a hearingloss caused by loud noise whats also called noiseinduced hearing loss one of the most common symptoms to accompany noise inducedhearing loss is tinnitus ringing in the ears tinnitus youve had it im sure pete townsend has it lets now read an excerpt from an article in the guardian after decades of playingand listening to loud music townsend suffers from bothtinnitus and partial deafness although his symptoms havereceded in recent months townsends problems reemergedafter the super bowl townsend said if my hearingis going to be a problem were not delaying shows were finished townsend told rolling stone magazine i cant really see anyway around the issue townsends medical fearshave already led the group to cancel their spring tourand scheduled appearances at coachella and the neworleans jazz festival now this is about a decade ago and for those of us who follow ringing in the ears and tinnitus we know that the symptom andthe sound itself can change it can get better it can get worse it can spike you can have periods whereyoure habituated to it meaning that itsessentially not a problem and you barely hear it in your life so where is he at now a article from the stpaul minnesota tribune had a few questions for mr townsend first question what do you hear on stage how do you deal with yourtinnitus in the context of playing with such a large orchestra townsend replied i dont suffer from tinnitus anymore this is old news that still goes around and round from and people forget i left the who in to with a few shows inbetween and gave my hearing a proper long rest and to the chagrin of guitar freaks stopped using my old veryloud guitar rigs on stage what do you recommend for people to do to protect their hearing for concerts recording studios and listeningwith personal devices townsend replied for workingmusicians and producers theres very little you can do if you wear protection orwork at very low sound levels you lose the vibe sorry thats my view we need to work at whatwould be illegal levels in industry or normal workplaces in order to feel what we do at least i do it inevitably causes damage then if youre me you get old and yourhearing deteriorates further i wear modern fancy hearing aids and life is grand for audiences where in factthe sound levels are far higher than on stage in my casethe decision is yours there you see in a year period pete townsend went fromsuffering with tinnitus having to cancel theirspring tour around including major performances like coachella out in california and the new orleans jazzfestival in louisiana and then nine years later in an article being asked about tinnitus and saying that he doesnt suffer from it anymore thats an impactful statement and it shows us that yourtinnitus can get better it shows us that this is not set in stone this is not a permanent forever condition that when its bad it will stay bad nothing could be farther from the truth if you have bad bothersome tinnitus and you have to avoid going to concerts if you cant go to work ifyou cant be around loud noise if its causing so much challenge that you have to take a break you can get back toliving your normal life even if you are a loud rock musician like pete townsend in pete townsend is back on tour as confirmed rolling stonewhich will show the image from the title of the rollingstone article right there his tinnitus has not causedhim to lay down his guitar hes back on the live music stage with maximum protection in ear monitors we hope all this to say in a year period pete townsend went from very loud bad tinnitus to much better tinnitus what happened in between was probably not a linear progression it was probably ups and downs good days bad daysgood months bad months some shows he probablywasnt bothered by it at all other shows it wascausing a lot of stress anxiety and emotional turmoil because the last thing he wants to do is cancel his tour or cancel his show now it was mentioned earlierin the article that from to with a few shows in between townsend gave his hearinga proper long rest and he stopped using veryloud guitars on stage now this is a good thing and it also brings upsomething thats sensitive and sometimes sad for the music community is that the very soundsthat bring us so much joy also can injure and hurt our ears and thats the nature of sound sound can damage and sound can heal what we see here with mrtownsend from the who is that hes being smart he understands that life is a marathon he understands thatgiving your ears a rest from loud noise has benefits he understands that he cango and be around loud music and it does not meanhis tinnitus will change and get worse and stay that way forever he probably understandsthat going onto a stage with loud music puts him at risk for a temporarily louder tinnitus and that usually would last between hours and days in our work we work via telehealth and we have relationships with patients we have therapy sessions we have appointments wherewere providing treatments were providing therapies for individuals with bothersome tinnitus one thing im proud toshow is that pete townsend is very openly explainingthat his tinnitus got better he doesnt suffer from it anymore he uses hearing aids to manage tinnitus he uses hearing aids as wellfor a hearing loss he has and he mentioned that he has these modern fancy hearing aids thats right because modernhearing aids are fancy and they not only providehelp for tinnitus as well as hearing loss but theres also featuresthat connect to a smartphone for bluetooth remote adjustments we work in the telehealth model for that and i agree that those devices are fancy and modern and quite helpful now whats next for petetownsend and other musicians like him who are aroundloud noise quite frequently who have a hearing loss who have tinnitus who are trying to figureout what they should do i want you to know that itsokay to be around loud noise whenever possible wear hearing protection being around loud noise will not make your

saving joe tempus als customer success story minutes,when yearold joe pelham set out from his home in surrey,i m joe i don t really remember anything from the day but i obviously know what s happened from what i ve been told and i was on my bike and it s quite late at night and a car came off and hit me from behind and the next thing i knew i was in hospital so yeah when we arrived on the scene with joe i just remember actually thinking that joe was the most unwell sickest child that was still alive after an accident i was really struck by the severity of his injuries when i first saw joe it was on the side of the road when he was being treated by the paramedics and obviously very concerned and upset and hoping for the best you know that he was going to be ok i did not think he was going to make it i knew that every second was critical and we saw so many doctors in that first hours but the first moment that i actually saw joe i barely recognized my son we need tempus to be able to deliver blood transfusions anaesthesia and these critical lifesaving procedures like joe had so without tempus patients like joe just would not be able to survive what they did on the spot i have no doubt saved his life it seemed like forever but they were obviously doing vital treatments with the equipment they ve got to put him in the best position to be able to get him to the hospital the hardest part of joe s recovery was the part in hospital so he d come out of intensive care and was moved onto a ward he had his own room on the ward but because he was unable to eat walk and do any of those things we had to really build him up to be able to be discharged because his weight was so low i recently met with the philips team and it was a great opportunity to say thank you for saving joe s life with the technology that was used to treat him on the day i realise that they do an amazing job and what they do saves people s lives and there s no doubt they saved joe s life on that night i m just really grateful that they saved me and brought me back up to scratch and now i can enjoy my life and move on,1.0

tms success story rebecca tolin cfs interstitial cystitis brain fog fibromyalgia,tms success story rebecca tolin chronic fatigue syndrome interstitial cystitis brain fog digestive issues fibromyalgia,hey everybody this is dan with pain free you im pleased to have yet another success story video for for the whole community ive got today rebecca tolin and rebecca is from the san diego california area and like me she had years of pain and im going to let her tell a little bit of what she experienced what that journey was like because the point here is even though she had years worth of and i had the same message here is it doesnt have to take you that long because youre getting a cheat sheet when i went through it this was before facebook youtube podcasts there werent that many books there werent that many coaches and experts and right now youve got so many resources available to you and its not going to take you years to get better so thats kind of my take on the whole year thing because people are like oh my god years i dont even want to listen to this ive been in it three years i dont have another ten to get better i just want to dissuade that fear right off the bat that youre getting a cheat sheet with me rebecca with the videos i put out rebecca is also a coach helps people out with the mind body type of symptoms so theres so many resources please dont fear a long recovery time frame it doesnt have to take that long so with that rebecca thank you for being willing to talk to my audience and share your story and kind of introduce yourself and kick into your story however you see fit is a free flow conversation yeah so great to meet you dan and i always tell people the same thing when you find this knowledge and information thats a turning point it took me years to get better because i really hadnt found it interestingly i had read healing back pain by dr sarno sometime during my year healing journey but i had chronic fatigue syndrome so my main symptoms were fatigue exhaustion weakness there was body pain but it wasnt specifically back pain brain fog to the point where i couldnt even remember a friends name or a colleagues name i couldnt concentrate there was a lot of digestive issues and just really inability to function so for me the symptoms did start after a really traumatic event i was in asia and i experienced an assault and after that time i got really really tired and it was hard to do anything and i went through about a year of trying to kind of push through the symptoms i did go to different doctors and they couldnt find anything i wasnt really in touch with the effect that this sexual assault had had on me i was still able to work i was an active tv news reporter i was still working full time but i was dragging then it worked out a year later so this would have been in i ended up going back to asia i already wasnt feeling that well now what i know about sort of learned associations i can see why this was just sort of a perfect storm for me went back to asia caught these three colds in a row and my whole system crashed after that i actually got a urinary tract infection on the long airplane back i had these colds and it was after that point i literally couldnt get out of bed for days then i got to the point where i could walk around the house but i really couldnt work i was a broadcast journalist and i couldnt go back to work insomnia was another really intense symptom so there was this sort of tired and wired feeling basically just everything went went haywire and so if you can imagine that was terrifying and like all of us i went on this quest to try to solve it to try to find the right pill or the right therapy and i do something real quick yeah please for the folks who are watching my very nonscientific nonmedical explanation for the fatigue i kind of joke that the brain goes holy cow life is way too intense go to sleep take a nap yes absolutely theres all sorts of physiology behind that but i think thats the case three calls in a row util when we are under a great deal of stress our immune system and our digestive system is massively suppressed which can allow things like colds and utis to take place when normally if we were not very stressed out the immune system would work better so these things all make sense given your prior trauma going back to asia and so like you said perfect storm kind of ripe to happen but i just wanted to throw those couple of things in for anybody watching that these are often what goes on when you are in this high state of stress trauma and perceived danger thats absolutely it and i do feel like my whole system felt like the world is unsafe the world is completely unsafe so im just going to keep you inside the house where you cant go anywhere the way this stuff works is mind body stuff your brain is your best friend here to keep you safe and protect you at all costs and sometimes the best way i can keep you safe is to keep you in bed thats it productive but you know thats the way your brain is not torturing you punishing you its here to keep you safe and sometimes a little maladapted because were saying this is not safe but yeah well exactly from a survival perspective it does make sense because our brain interprets physical threats the same as psychological threats and although the physical threat had passed it was perceiving all these psychological threats going back in the world the assault that happened to me happened to be with somebody that i had worked with even though it was in another country so work was associated with danger in my subconscious mind i didnt realize this all then and so instead i went to integrative doctors allopathic doctors naturopathic doctors and they all diagnosed it as chronic fatigue syndrome csme post viral syndrome epstein bar syndrome sometimes myalgia and then over the years they come up with all these ancillary diagnoses like leaky gut syndrome and candida overgrowth and all these things but i remember pretty early on doctor said to me there is no cure for this we dont know the cause and youre going to have to live with it and that actually really set the stage for me and unfortunately i i believed them even a family member even flew me across the country to pennsylvania to see even a natural path who specializes in cfs and he pretty much said the same thing and i thought if even a naturopathic doctor saying this im really just going to have to live with this now there was a part of me that always knew like theres got to be a way to overcome this but there were times i would really lose touch with that because i felt so sick i was scared and so then i went on just this odyssey for years of course like all the the supplements the diet i even did antiviral ivs in my veins which actually just put me back months vitamin is all kinds of erratic treatments enemas everything you can imagine i went to healers about practitioners over a year period and at some point i did start going to psychotherapist i went to a trauma therapist and i think that was getting a lot closer to the root of the issue that didnt really moved the needle either it was helpful to talk about the trauma and sort of unpack that but i think the dilemma there is that you have psychology and medicine and theyre not connecting the two this is actually the exact same thing and so the psychologist i saw werent helping me connect it the one point yeah the mind and body are not connected they are one system yes its not just that theyre connected its one system you cant separate them yeah absolutely its all part of the same theyre all these different parts of us are communicating and interconnected all the time yeah so basically i just went on like that for so many years i was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars i had lost my career after about a year they couldnt keep the job open and i knew i wanted to be a journalist from the time i was in th grade i loved it i worked for pbs at the time i covered science and nature so i lost that and i went on disability at some point actually it took years because i just didnt want to acknowledge i was disabled but i was losing my house i couldnt support myself what i realized looking back now is there was a lot of other losses that contributed to the symptoms because there were so many social stresses for close family members actually died during the next five years including my father who i was taking care of the best i could so all these things were actually exacerbating the symptoms because there is just so much underlying emotion and conflict but again i was still pretty much looking at it as a physical thing now i was a yogi even before the cfs and so i had practiced yoga so i did continue and all i could do is like restorative poses on the floor but i would stretch and i would notice i just feel like a little bit of relief and then some years in i started meditating i started practicing transcendental meditation and of course i thought that was going to be the thing because a lot of people get better from insomnia and things through meditation but it didnt resolve those symptoms but whenever i would meditate practice yoga i was listening to eckhart tolle a lot and reading different self discovery books i would just feel more at peace and i would notice thats interesting this is my favorite time of the day you know over the years sometimes i could go out of the house and do little things although i still couldnt work so i then got to this point and im kind of a slow learner and like you said this wasnt all readily available back then so it took probably about twelve years before i just kind of surrendered and i would say some sort of surrender happened to me there was so much angst associated with being on this roller coaster of going to the next healer the next person that was going to cure me or fix me that finally there was just this sort of surrender like im letting go and actually it did happen after this practitioner i went to this practitioner who was supposedly a shaman and basically was smoking her pipe and had asked me about the trauma i went through and i started telling her and i started crying and then she started talking about her cat dressing up her cat for halloween and it was just this very strange abrupt behavior and i kind of froze up i became really numb because he kind of opened up that wound and i remember she said its and i wrote out the check and i was just really kind of frozen and i left there and i just realized like nobody else has the answers this is ridiculous you know going to this woman acting this way charging me this money and that was you know i fake her because that was the last straw of really giving my power away you hit the wall and said i cant keep doing this i love that metaphor i love that metaphor i think of it as like i banged my head against the wall you know times and the hundredth time was like nope thats not working i hit the same no more i cant do this anymore had to fire a physical therapist that was trying to untwist me because i was very crooked and i finally had to say im done im sick and tired of being sick and tired i have to stop trying to fix myself im just going to do what i want to do whether i heard or not and i just started focusing on that and it got out of story mode because a lot of the journey was journaling and writing and expressive writing and all this emotional discovery and i was like let me just get away from the story mode and just feel emotions what am i feeling let me sit with the emotion not necessarily the story behind it getting out of story mode stop trying to fix myself and just shifting focus to living life i think its like an acceptance surrender acceptance same thing pretty much like okay this is where i am im not going to spend the rest of my life just being down on myself because this is where im at so let me just focus on living my life and over time i started getting better we had a similar timeline in trajectory because actually thats very similar to that sense of just okay im going to just enjoy what i can now i couldnt do much outside of the house i could do a little bit but it didnt matter anymore i would just go in the backyard or i could go to a local nature preserve and i would just stare at the leaves in the trees and i would listen to the water and stream and i started falling into this deep piece like i said i was listening to eckhart tolle a lot he was the soundtrack of my life and hes all about being in the moment in peace and something shifted before that th year where i felt completely okay in my mind there was peace of mind with my life and even with my body and dan what was so interesting was that went on almost a year where i still had flu like symptoms with cfs its like having the flu can be quite extreme but i was at peace with it and it was really fascinating and there was this realization that happened in that year that outer conditions even health relationships jobs they dont make us happy there is an inner peace there is something that you can find inside of yourself thats okay in this moment so i lived like that for almost a year and what i found that propelled me to taken off online writing class because again i wasnt really going out to classes but it was with a woman named martha beck and i love this class and i met this community of women it was all about expressing our inner truth so theres some of that emotional work but interestingly when i sort of gave up a fight gave up the fixing the frustration all of howard suner five s then what happened is i met this woman in the class and she said you know i have really severe cfs and i recovered through this work from dr john sarno do you want to set up a phone call and i was like you know i can talk on the phone for about minutes and then i get a migraine i was still there like if we can talk or if we can talk in a short bit hours later on this phone conversation i was just filling with energy because she was explaining the work of basically sarno and schooner but she was saying you know i know these symptoms are real but they are happening in your brain and in your nervous system these are just learn neuro circuits she explained she went through it for almost the same number of years and she fully recovered she talked about the science i love science because i was a science reporter for pbs and i got it by the end of that conversation she said rebecca you are not sick and those four words changed my life they somehow just sunk in on the deepest level i said i am not sick and dan i am not kidding everything shifted in that moment my body went into just energy i was pulsing with a sense of aliveness i actually got up this was in the winter of at night and i started running around the block now i had it ran in years i just felt like she enhanced me the get out of jail free card it was like wow i get whats happening and how this all happened and that i can unlearn it now that was not the end of the story so for people who say oh wait i dont have i didnt have a book here or talk to someone and get better ive had to work at it let me assure you i did have to work at it so then what happened is like for about the next week i felt miraculously good not normal but a lot better but then symptoms started coming back because theres all those lured neural pathways and my brain really did still think there was all these dangers in the world on top of the fact that all these doctors have convinced me i was weak and broken viruses had invaded my brain i was allergic to foods like id been hearing for so long you know that those were all kind of learned thoughts as well so i knew that this was the past though i was sure maybe sure for your recent video this was the path and i wanted to work with someone so i hired a mind body coach jim prusa okay we actually came right to this room for about eight months and hes wonderful and we really just worked on the knowledge a lot of somatic meditation so you talked about just feeling emotions and being with sensations and that was a huge part of my recovery so for me i would say it was the knowledge and really steeping myself in it reading sarno reading shovener alan gordon listening to you listening to podcasts and then really being with the felt experience of these really uncomfortable sensations and often when i would do that like fatigue is what is it its heaviness or like i had all this burning and kind of tingling in my limbs when i would be with that through this lens of safety it sometimes would shift into emotions and anger would come up and even some memories would come up and then it would start to dissipate and i felt like i am interacting with the raw energy of the symptoms the so called illness so i did that for months and i loved it i still practice somatic meditations before bed just because i like to come back into the body even though i feel really good in my body for the most part and then i started challenging all those triggers so that was tricky because i perceived everything is dangerous talking to someone eating working sleeping not consciously you would have met me and thought i seem like a well adjusted person i wasnt living in paranoia but subconsciously so i just started challenging all that and i would go meet a friend for tea and id have all these symptoms just from that but i was like great i can really train my brain that this is safe when symptoms come on its an opportunity to just be mindful be present send these different messages you know i was constantly talking to myself i am not sick i am not broken i couldnt quite go to i am healthy i am not sick i could believe but im safe my brain is just creating these sensations im okay my body is okay in this moment emotions are welcome here and i accept the sensations that im feeling right now and slowly but surely started moving out in the world again yeah the resistance to the symptoms keeps them keeps them going because were like the way and running away and all that does is keep you in that high state of stress fight or flight and you know the brain and nervous system is not going to really calm down if youre in that mode of resistance freak out fear oh my god i got to get out of here right and thats what causes so many people to say well that was a trigger that was a trigger that was a trigger so let me eliminate those triggers and before you know it you dont leave your house thats it and then you get to the point where its like what am i even living for if i dont leave my house whats my reason for being whats my meaning in my life and i think thats really key and i heard you say that dan that you started just living your life again and even though i was physically limited i started living my life again prior to the tms breakthrough and then after that breakthrough yeah i would even go out in the evening to meet a friend for dinner and i would have insomnia all night and then the next day i feel like i had the flu but i was like oh well i mean im on the right path it doesnt matter anymore im not stuck and i kept doing that and in fact its interesting because a really important moment for me was when i flew across the country to new hope pennsylvania to meet these women i had been in the online writing class with and i was so scared because everything was going to be kind of out of my control id been doing this work for probably four months but i was like im ready i hardly slept that whole time because i was spending the night in a house with twelve people id never met but i at the time of my life it was so worth it and i felt like that trip was like a reclaiming of my life and then just kept doing it to the point where i got back to really doing everything i want to do in life and the symptoms subsided i started sleeping well again in addition to tms there was a piece that really did help with my sleep that was a cognitive behavioral therapy theres a book called say goodness to insomnia by greg jacobs which i think is really consistent with tms theory and its just basically retraining your brain because insomnia a learned behavior too so you can just learn different behaviors to sleep so that was really helpful and then within probably nine months i was feeling great and not just physically great as you know this gives you back your sense of vitality meaning self empowerment was a big one for me to sort of take back because for me i think with the trauma you feel so disempowered so i was never going to heal through a state of someone else saying do this thing with your body that im going to tell you to do it wasnt going to happen i had to take back my power and say no this is through my thoughts my emotions i did a lot of work examining thoughts that were thinking i was maybe weak or fragile or things like that and just really turning them around into thoughts that were more empowering and that felt better i would notice how to thoughts make me feel and if they make me feel weaker or more contracted theyre not my truth ill let those go and find thoughts and beliefs that feel stronger in my body feel safer i like that phrase let them go because i talk a lot about becoming aware of the mental state and we can get into this mental state of a fearful mary go round of scary dark unbroken thoughts and like you said we can just choose to say i dont have to believe that or take it seriously im going to let them go and we have so many thoughts a day that we can literally just let the ones that are not empowering the ones that hold us down the ones that say were broke and we can just literally let them fly by at the speed of light because theres tens of thousands more coming today and so we dont have to grab on to the dark and ugly ones and hold on to them and ruminate on them and repeat them all day long but thats what i naturally do because again if the brain perceives that these bad things are true its going to kind of habitually stay there in an effort to keep us safe right we have that biological programming but youre right i also think of it like you do like kind of you see a bird in the sky you can just let it fly by and then when you start reconnecting to your emotions and physical sensations i symptoms in a safe way you can connect how thoughts make you feel and when thoughts are consistently dragging you down why would you want to keep thinking them so thats why for me like that somatic work and kind of becoming reassociated in my body i was pretty disassociated was so important and i think too like then we get much more in touch with our gut instinct in our own intuition and so many other aspects of life when were rooted in our body yeah i like pointing out how hana studley do you know her she has a nice group so shes always saying this which is we are always feeling our thinking right so i like to take that and twist it a little bit and say if youre feeling shitty youre probably thinking shitty use the language but its kind of true and thats why so much of the work i do with my coaching clients is geared towards just becoming more aware of the mental state the physical state the emotional state a couple of gentle suggestions on what to do when those things are going off the rails a little bit yeah exactly because i do find for some people it is more their thoughts maybe they have a lot of self pressure perfectionism and they keep beating themselves up and that sends signals to the brain youre not safe with other people i think with me i really did need to feel some of the the emotions and like i said just the symptoms in my body in the safe way to really retrain my brain that theyre okay and it doesnt have to keep amplifying the signal because im picking up on the signal but im sending feedback that im safe that its okay and that sort of breaks that symptom stress cycle that you get caught in for sure yeah i also as part of it when i say you notice your emotional state becoming elevated absolutely its time to feel them right lets not sweeten onto the carpet and try to make believe were not angry or sad or upset or whatever that also means we dont have to explode on the people around us because thats where a lot of us have learned that emotions are dangerous because last time i did that it didnt go too well so i better not do that again so we think theres only two choices so if i cant explode it to people around me i better sweep it under the rug and im like no theres a third choice deal it for yourself emotion i cry do it in your bathroom do it in your car do it in your bedroom somewhere dont because when you run away promotions they accumulate and i until they build up so much you do blow up at the people around you and then that doesnt go well and then it just reconfirm the brain rains belief that emotions are dangerous right because most of us didnt have a role model for healthy emotion we may have seen people either blow up or for press and so that becomes this habit and youre right what i found with myself is it so important to create space for emotions i was someone that grew up not really thinking emotions were very safe and thats still kind of in my programming every day i i create some space its usually just with some somatic meditation but just to allow any emotions to bubble up or if i am really angry thats when journaling really works for me especially with anger i would say journaling wasnt the main part of my healing but if im really angry and i just completely vent onto the page you get it out sometimes ill just dance or shake or kind of move my body and then you dont have to explode at the person you generally dont have to do anything with the other person but what i found is if we make space to feel and acknowledge our own emotions if there is an action to be taken with someone else like we do need to have a conversation or set a boundary were clear were in a state of empowerment and were not coming out firing at them which just complicates it i call those adult conversations yeah when you allow yourself like you just said to feel the emotion first that adult conversation is going to go a heck of a lot better as opposed to coming in ready to explode were already exploding so healing is always a really good idea even if you have to have that adult conversation you said it in just slightly different words but same exact message thats cool something i really liked i did learn along the way is nonviolent communication and thats telling someone how you feel so i think too as we acknowledge well im feeling scared or im feeling sad or im frustrated as we acknowledge that to ourselves it can be a way we communicate to someone else where were owning this is how i feel instead of just coming out you did this you did that everythings kind of coming from the inside out and it just it has such a positive effect on relationships everything you do in the world all side effects from this work are positive right yeah because it is a journey of self exploration i mean there are those people who read the book and get better but for the most part i think most of us really just need some self exploration and its really satisfying because i found whatever kind of got you into the symptoms will get you out of it in my case i was really detached from my emotions i used to live from the neck up i wasnt really picking up on signals that there actually was danger in my environment because i was really detached from my emotional self so for me i had to come back into that wholeness of being willing to feel emotions that were told or negative but theyre not theyre just part of the whole realm of being human right frustration anger sadness and then that makes room for more peace and joy and some of this other spectrum yeah so i found it was like coming back into the things that made me whole anyway that makes life so much more satisfying to live and that calms the nervous system right because its sort of like knows okay shes on board shes present shes picking up on these signals and sending back some positive ones yeah i talk a lot about creating consistent messages of safety so that the brain says theyre doing okay and i talk about the physical state so if youre like this the brain is not perceiving safety theyre perceiving danger so if youre barely breathing and youre tight brain is not going to think youre safe its not going to settle down its always going to stay vigilant you are running away from your emotions and afraid of them and i have heard people say directly to me i am terrified of my emotions yeah okay well were going to have to shift that lets reframe this makes you human not damaged and in my case the example i give is i used to believe that if i got angry i was a sleepy bleep like my dad yeah and i never wanted to be like it and so everybodys got these preconceived learned beliefs about themselves if they feel a certain emotion im a bad person out of control mental ill or whatever it may be and its not true at all motions are human theyre supposed to be felt so thats a big part of teaching the brain that this thing called emotions are actually safe how do you do it by actually feeling them not by running away from them and locking them in the basement so exactly thats what start me language just from different perspective so its great i love these conversations i geek out on this stuff say to people when sarno said dont repress emotions whats the opposite of that feel them right i do think with some people that can be a piece that theyre missing if they dont just respond to the knowledge and it can take creating a safe environment to feel them just with yourself with someone like you dan if people feel they want to work with someone but just find the right environment to sort of open up that aspect of yourself also when people say why cant feel any emotions what i found is just starting to feel like the pain the burning the tingling those different things in my body kind of like opened the door to more anger fear you know peace joy all those things and theyre very similar really symptoms and emotions are really similar ones more sensory one has more of an emotional quality but we feel them in our body right thats why theyre called feelings because we actually feel them im choked up ive got a heavy heart felt like a kick in the gut we experience emotions physically and if we get sick to my stomach i was on pins and needles its in all our language that we have a certain experience an emotion comes and then we have a physical response were embarrassed and we bless our palms get sweaty and you know what i think people can accept like if theyre upset maybe they get a headache or they have insomnia so its really the same thing thats happening with these symptoms is just we kind of can get stuck in longer cycles and then of course we have those learn neuro pathways fortunately our brains are plastic and we can learn new things all the time and become who were really meant to be we just have to give the brain better instructions yeah so it can give us a different output because as long as were giving it instructions that say oh my god im broken im never going to get better im sick i cant leave the house im going to lose my house i cant even work how am i going to pay for food and all youre doing is running around the house freaking out or laying in bed freaking out for that matter the brain is not getting any new information in which to make a shift so one of my strongest phrases is nobody ever got that or by freaking out nobody did because that reptilian brain just thinks youre in a state of danger and it creates symptoms to warn you yeah a lot of it too and im sure that youre doing this all day long dan and i just so appreciate the work you do its so consistent its so solid and you share it with so much love thank you for that now as you said im a coach too and so a lot of the people i work with have similar diagnosis because they can relate and theyre being told oh its high levels of epstein bar its high levels of lime all these things i was told come to find out those are incidental findings too just like a lot of the structural abnormalities ive recently found studies that show a lot of asymptomatic people have high titers of lime or epstein bar i think its happening with a lot more even than bulging disks or degenerative disc i really tell people i overcame it anyway even though i had levels of epstein barr that the doctor said theyd never seen before and all those scary things it crossed into your brain and its like didnt seem to matter i got better anyway so a lot of it is that education and kind of re educating people and youre right though through this different accurate information that is a different paradigm in healing and none of this is positive thinking and false hope it says accurate information about how the human body and the brain and the nervous system and the immune system the digestive system how it actually works and when you realize that the body is designed to function optimally it only starts to kind of go off the rails when its got an overload of stress tension emotions traumas and the perception of danger which you described earlier its just like when the brain is completely terrified its hard for it to operate optimally so its our job to use the accurate information to teach the brain okay look around were really not in danger were okay and we all have that innate well being inside of us one of the quotes that came out in one of my group calls recently was somebody said and they heard it from somebody else i dont know who to credit it to but they said my body is handling this i dont need to get involved meaning my brain doesnt need to get involved trust the body it knows what to do give the brain better information so it can calm the heck down and when the brain calms down what happens the nervous system calms down when the nervous system calms down all these symptoms that have been like static electricity for years can start to like oh were doing better yes thats what its about it learning deciding that youre actually okay youre not sick youre not broken youre not ill you know tms or this mind body stuff people will say okay great then so youre telling me my body is not the problem so that must mean i have a mental illness or im emotionally damaged no youre not that either none of this none of it is our fault its just where we ended up exactly its this brain and the nervous system i love how you put that because i really saw it as the brains the master controller and so when it gets the proper information and it can become aligned and regulated in the nervous system it trickles down to all the other systems of the body digestion starts working better hormones start working better cardiovascular starts working better its true that it has a trickle down effect maybe those other systems arent working optimally but not because somethings wrong with them or wrong with those tissues themselves yeah we just take in different information so you are talking about some of the gut diagnosis like leaky gut is that the problem or is that the result of this tms and i joke it tms is too much stress combined with tmt too much thinking of which is too much fear and that system overload that symptoms start happening but then we go get medicalized by the medical community and told were broken were never going to get better get used to it and that just makes the whole thing overflow more we just keep on turning up the flame on the stovetop and this pot called the nervous system just keeps on boiling over and so so much of the things that rebecca and i are talking about the accurate knowledge the application of that the consistent messages to the brain teaching the brain that the emotions are safe the body is safe that even our thoughts are safe is going past that stove and dialing down the flame and instead of heating up and boiling over this whole system can kind of come down to a simmer and then eventually cool off completely and so thats where rebecca is hes killed off completely and if you experience any type of symptoms i would imagine correct me if im wrong but your fear level is very very low absolutely if theres a lot of stress ill get some symptoms theyre miles but generally it either goes to the little bit of fatigue or what i didnt even mention yet was interstitial cystitis also became a really big issue for me during the same years and so maybe ill get a little bit of bladder spasming but i know exactly whats happening and if i dont i just say whats happening emotionally so that was actually a practice that i started during these healing months with tms is whenever i get a symptom or even fear or anxiety id ask whats happening emotionally whats underneath that because theres always something thats why the symptoms there and so now ill just ask that and ill try to carve out a little time to be with that sometimes all i have to do is say oh you know what the bladder stuff can be pissed off right when we have to pay all the time so yeah its very simple but its coming back to the emotional level so i dont go down any of those rabbit holes anymore i mean i havent been to a doctor in years at this point youd have to really convince me that somethings physical id probably lean on the other side and there are physical things with clients i do say you absolutely need to get checked and make sure its not physical but just briefly on the interstitial cystitis that one was tricky because i had had urinary tract infections for years through my twenties in my thirties and they were actual infections that had to be treated although i now see they also definitely had an emotional component they linked back unfortunately to a previous sexual trauma when i was a teenager and then i started getting utis and so at some point though in the years of the chronic fatigue syndrome i went to the doctor i thought i had a uti and they said no theres no bacteria and i was like no no there really is this is excruciating it was like a nine out of ten no bacteria so then they start calling it interstitial cystitis and want to put a scope up there and medications which i was going to have none of but i will say that that also went away with the tms work and also with some of the emotional work i do find a lot of women i work primarily with women that have had a sexual trauma or something in their pelvic area theres usually an emotional component thats linked to that and so it can take some processing that writing about that talking to someone and mostly like you say just feeling feeling whats present and then our body knows how to find balance so one of the things that i like to make sure people understand is while the emotions are absolutely part of it likely why it all got started many people have done therapy theyve done journaling theyve done all of the emotional work and theyre still not getting better and its causing them to doubt this whole mind body thing because theyre like ive been doing emotional work for two years im still no better why not and it goes beyond just the emotions emotions are absolutely important allowing yourself to feel them is important but we still have to teach the brain that the body is okay so if youre on the fence you still think there might be a physical problem or you know if youre still terrified of the symptoms if youre terrified of your emotions and your brain and nervous system is constantly in that freak out mode i dont care how well you journal and process your trauma with a therapist we still have other things that are really equally important and so yeah its a multi faceted problem and its a multi faceted solution and so thats why its really important to get all of it handled yeah and thats why sarno called it knowledge therapy because you have to have that first and then youre right then the other pieces you kind of see what you need do you need more working with your thoughts and affirmations do you need more emotional work more calming the nervous system was helpful for me through meditation and breath work but yeah you need that foundation and its very personal and i so appreciate dan that you talk about the same concepts through a wide range of subjects and diagnoses because ill find myself say your videos to clients its like he talked exactly what you were just saying and somehow when they hear it from someone else about whatever theyre grappling with whatever symptom or doubt you know its just its really helpful thats cool do you have anything else youd like to share with the audience because its a pretty big audience anything else youd like to share how can people get in touch with you yeah well the best way is through my website its rebecca tolen com so thats just rebeccatolin dot com you can sign up for a free somatic meditation on the website to sort of start to practice this if youre not already but really i would just say to you find your own sense of empowerment and so on this healing journey whatever gives you a sense of relief peace empowerment self compassion thats your healing path thats creating the grounds for healing if youre doing things as a means to an end like oh i have to eliminate foods that i like and take supplements a day just because this doctor told me but im so frustrated so just contracted about that those arent setting up the grounds for healing youll really know youre on the right path because youll feel much more hopeful and empowered and so with this tms work thats what it does but it can as you say a lot dan it can take time it can take practice so dont give up if its not working immediately keep going at it and see what that missing link is for you and it will fall into place and as soon as you start feeling safer and less scared of your body and your sensations they will turn down in their own time so we let go of the timeline and just let it all happen i always say that the goal is to turn down fear of the symptoms not to get rid of the symptoms yeah and its definitely baby steps nobody is going to listen to this interview and tomorrow be like im done no fear honestly i think the book cures are those freaks of nature who read a book and go im fine im not afraid and immediately get back to life and they like zero fear because okay heres an answer this makes sense yeah a lot of people seem to think that those people end up with a symptom imperative later they get their ten otherwise yes i think that definitely happens much of the time thats it and it can also be with people who didnt have a lot of stress or trauma in their life and they just needed a little bit better information clara yeah so listen unless youve got anything else this was wonderful thank you so much for sharing your expertise your experience your journey with my audience hopefully some people will resonate with you and reach out to you i dont know i kind of view you as a not competition but like friendly competition because the more of us that are out there the more people are going to be able to hear about this stuff and get better and its well just widen the entire audience even bigger and bigger and bigger so i love doing these calls especially with somebody whos so passionate about your own experience that youre saying this is what im down doing for a career because i am so passionate about helping people and honestly i dont know too many pms coaches experts therapists doctors even who have not gone through their own journey yeah absolutely not compelled to do this work if youve never had any chronic symptoms youre just going to find something else to do because it doesnt it doesnt draw you in for me yeah i dont feel like i have any choice in the matter like this is what i have to do and you feel the same like forget news im doing this this is what matters to me and i feel honored to be in the same community as you as a colleague i so appreciate everything you give and we are working together and it takes a village because i really see this as creating a new paradigm in understanding whats happening in our mind in our body and in many ways its sort of a grassroots effort but we take it back to doctors and family members and other people that we know and it spreads and youre spreading it in a big way so i really appreciate the opportunity to meet you and to speak to your people this has been great so thank you i appreciate it im sure people are going to love this conversation ill let you know when its up on the web but youll see it show up if youre just following along youll see it facebook and youtube and youll see it come up might take a few days to a week but for sure ill definitely get posted and thank you again i really appreciate your rebecca thank you dan likewise alright appreciate it,1.0
fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue success story pain free you,monica from nj shares her long journey with fibromyalgia if you dont think there is any hope for anyone with fibromyalgia or,everybody this is dan with pain free you and today im here with monica from new jersey monica has agreed to share her story with me and with all of you because shes had a real long journey a long one i think about years she said with fibromyalgia cfs chronic fatigue syndrome back pain leg pain and probably some other symptoms as well along the way and she wanted to share her story just to let you know that this stuff is a legitimate thing and there is hope to get better especially for the fibromyalgia folks who if you go to doctor google it says we dont know what causes it and there is no cure well there is a cure and shell prove that thats the case so monica you say hello introduce yourself and however you want to launch into your story its fine you dont have to start when you were three years old but kind of when things kind of started going sideways for you what happened and when you found out about this dr sarno tms guy and ill let you you tell your story thank you so much dan sure i was super healthy year old and i woke up one day and felt like i had the flu and i was just completely out of the blue im super sick body pain i felt like i had a fever and im like okay im sick and it got worse and worse and worse and started going to the doctor no one had any idea what was wrong with me i eventually tested positive for the steam bar so they said oh youre really high with upstream bar thats probably it but it never went away and then the fatigue was so bad i couldnt move i couldnt get out of bed i couldnt work at the time i was a a freelance artist doing graphic design i did website and catalogs for small to medium size businesses i couldnt get out of that i couldnt continue working it was horrible i went to a new doctor every month i went to um i went to every doctor in sectors that you could imagine and they did not know what was wrong with me and then finally they started to say you need to see a hematologist and a neurologist and they all kind of came together and said you have css and fibre and that they told me to overlap because i had so much fatigue and so much pain and they told me they didnt know what caused it that theres no cure some doctors told me theyve seen patients get better within five to years wonderful some doctor told me i will never get better which i think its been really common from what i hear from anyone that i speak to even google says there is no cure we dont know what causes it just because they dont know whats going on doesnt mean theres no way out right right at the time it all started in so to me that i didnt have a lot of information anytime i would just google css the symptoms came up and i checked for all of them and im like alright this is me and i started getting book some chronic fatigue syndrome i joined the help support groups and i suffered for at least three years years maybe it was interesting how like the first two years is mostly with the css symptom right and then it gradually got into super fibromyalgia where the pain increase but the fatigue wasnt as bad there was a noted difference which is weird right but that css is so real i would try and go to work and i would go and sleep in my car i would almost wanted to fall asleep under the desk i could fall asleep on the sidewalk i was it was just unreal and even when i went to the doctors i dont think they even believe me youre the hyper contract like everythings wrong with you but i was so determined to get better right this is not going to stop me oh i went to a holistic healer right she told me she tested me for everything i had so much blood work she looks for life bacteria my mitochondria she did experimental vitamin iv wow im getting goosebumps just thinking about it we dont create flashbacks like you know once our office you can leave some details out if its traumatizing and i was in this room with six people and she gave me an id of vitamin b vitamin c and then she called it like a cocktail and it was so strong i could smell the vitamin c oh and she also gave me vials of vitamin b okay like you dont have energy its going to help you you need this i did self injections every night of like whatever ccs and vitamin b nothing nothing absolutely no change at all there was one point we went to great adventure and my husband had to push me in a wheelchair i just couldnt use i couldnt walk i couldnt i mean at that time i was like thats crazy and youre like hey this is my life right and finally i was with a client i was building her website and i just was commenting on the body pain and she looked at me and i was telling her all these therapies what i was trying to do she just looked at me and said monica all you need is this handed me john sarnos book and a huge stack massager okay it was like this enormous thing it was like a dollars thing she says i dont need it anymore thats awesome thats all she said oh god my arm you get right oh my god my whole face is just like emotional when you start thinking back to what you went through so thats cool what did you do where did you go from there did you read the book so simultaneously as i was reading the book my uncle whos a doctor was trying to help me okay and he brought me to a hypnotherapist and the hypnotherapist is kind of like on the same track she just must have known and all she did was just say you need to keep telling yourself that youre healthy she says youre not sick thats sarnos core message theres nothing wrong with you to live your life theres nothing wrong with you you think you are broken but theres nothing wrong with you and its really a matter of teaching the brain youre okay at that point dan i stopped telling myself i was sick i took csx and fibro out of my vocabulary perfect i took the word pain out of my vocabulary every day i told myself over and over and over i am full of health im a healthy person i never said im sick ever again awesome its like within six months i had my whole life back and i went back to full time work and was exercising running like five miles a day got promoted went on to another career had like just fantastic energy and i just never looked back yeah thats unbelievable because we were talking before we actually hit record here and she was saying monica was saying that anytime she would tell somebody with fibromyalgia that i used to have it and im better they dont believe her and so thats one of the reasons were doing this call here is because this whole mind body concept is really really what causes the vast majority of chronic illness certainly fibromyalgia other pains other syndromes burning numbness tingling weakness migraines you name it all sorts of symptoms can come from the brain now just a quick question we dont have to get into the context of what was going on in your life but was it a very stressful time in your life when youre in your mid twenties its so funny because at the time you dont put the two and together well thats what i want to connect for the viewers here okay so why did this happen in the first place and dont share anything youre not comfortable with but could you see a connection now looking backwards i had a huge life event that happened three months before that flu came on where a good friend of mine stopped talking okay significant abandonment so i dont get to do some i guess its okay its the anger and the rage its complete rage so angry that someone would not want to talk to me she doesnt want to be my friend and she was my friend since we were like six years old she was my best friend she was my maid of honor and people change she went off to new york and met new people and we werent on the same track anymore and i kept like how come were not hanging out and shes just like monica im not on the same level of friendship as you anymore and i took that really hard i took it really personal also at the same time you know my marriage is failing the anger like when he talks about emotions like theres a lot of emotions but when you start just breaking everything down i really hone in on the anger and internal rage and you never think about it you would never ever think about im a happy person i got everythings going great but when you start just by setting things and youre like you know what i was really mad that she didnt want to talk to me i was really mad that i was in an unhappy marriage and i wasnt living my life right and dr sarno for anybody whos new to these concepts dr sarno speaks that its repressed emotions primarily anger and rage and what do we mean by that it means that these emotions are so overwhelming scary dangerous they dont fit with your own self image so what do we do with those emotions we go they dont belong thats not who i am so we believe its not there we swallow it and before we know it the brain its getting close to the surface and so no theory is that the brain creates this illness these symptoms as a way to actually protect us from these emotions which the brain perceives as more dangerous than crippling fatigue and so you end up getting sick go ahead it still the need sure so i became paralyzed i the king six i needed my husband to dote on me i didnt have to face the idea of having friendships and like oh well like all this relationship didnt work out im bed ridden nobody else can reject you now because youre not going out and putting yourself out in public yeah i like my whole life to shut down i was like no we cant do this anymore and that kept you safe from another crushing has no idea youre personal yeah right hes not going to divorce me now i cant move and i cant work thats what happens but again i know that sounds really far out there but the brains job is to keep us safe and keep us alive and in your case it sounds like and look monica and i just met for the first time tonight but it was truly keeping her safe from that crushing rejection and abandonment from other social situations and friends and even her husband thats wild and those things are so huge and devastating that hopefully anybody watching can start to see that that could result in physical symptoms and it often does very often even minor where like if youre going out to a party and then all of a sudden you get a headache theres something wrong with your head right you just dont want to go out go home before somebody makes you feel like you dont belong there right or you have back pain so you cant go to work your back on you just have any problem with warren now heres the point of all this i mean you know once you got through this and learned about the tms and the mind body connection and really worked to convince and sell like youre selling something your own subconscious brain that your body is already okay when the brain finally started to believe it the symptoms start to go away but unfortunately in monica case in most peoples cases you get traumatized by the medical system i mean could you imagine at years old saying youll never get better youre always going to be like this get used to it thats essentially what they told you which is devastating thats a man thing doctors god bless your client for giving you that yeah im not blaming the doctors but god bless your client for giving you the sarno and saying here good for you for saying i need to look at this and then recognizing and connecting the dots and then making the commitment to yourself to say these words are no longer in my vocabulary its fantastic and you literally convinced and sold your brain your subconscious on the fact that theres nothing wrong with me and your brain listened and eventually turned off the symptoms so that was a number of years ago i think you said years ago and the fiber and the fatigue kind of disappeared you hinted that theres been some additional hurdles along this journey so you want to share any of that stuff in my fingers started going to and it started with like my pinkie and then it went up out to my other fingers to like a point where almost my hands were just like tingling and like okay this is not right so i went to the doctor and he said i need to refer you to a neurologist makes sense and a lot of doctors looked at me and they thought i had enough so they did a brain scan and it came back they said we found two lesions on your brain so you might have brain cancer or ms so they brushed me to the emergency room at jackson in philadelphia right and they were starting to put needles and my legs and feet to see like what kind of pathways were like messed up and i could feel all the pins okay and i was waiting waiting waiting the neurologist was calling for a final tab and they were prepping me for that then all these offers came down and said monica we looked at your scams again and theres nothing wrong its just coming up as a they called it like a freckle on the brain they said its just completely normal these scans come up very highly sensitive youre fine go home were you relieved or were you like did you start to connect the dots to the whole tms mind body stuff again or were you saying theyre missing something i need to go see more doctors where were you i was very relieved having numb hands is a very real feeling of course and it sounds like super neurological i did everything i was supposed to do i went the doctor i got the testing and thank god whoever read the scan again it crack my soul open right but you did the right thing so for anybody whos watching it always is prudent to go rule out anything significant things like life threatening like potential brain cancer tumors aneurysms you know neurological she had to nerve conduction test to make sure that everything was working and it was so look were not saying blind faith just trust the fact that your brain is creating this to distract you and protect you from emotions rule out the life threatening but then you can rule in this thing called mind body syndrome and there are specific ways to do that so fantastic alright so keep going this is a hell of a ride it is crazy that was and then were you able to get rid of the symptoms once you found out youre okay you said okay its the same thing my hands are fine thats cool i got better awesome they also told me first it started out with corporal tunnel its right when you start researching people have been typing and sitting at desks for hundreds of years and were fine and they used to use the mechanical typewriters that were like and now theyre saying that these computers are dangerous which is ridiculous i did all the weird ergonomic stuff so then they said it wasnt carpal tunnel it was my one nerve that you have to stop putting pressure here and i got all the super testing everything they said you have a compressed nerve and youre fine so that was after that then my legs started to hurt so first my right leg cramped up and im like okay youre stressed out monica just show youre fine then my left leg cramps up and now both my legs are so tight i was seeing stars and for hours and hours and hours the muscle dont relax like a charlie horse tight and i would try and walk and my legs were so tight that it was like pushing my hips together so i had just insane hit pan and lower back team and the pain was just like at a level where i couldnt think straight i could barely walk again im like youre stressed out your legs your leg fine but it was so bad i went to the doctors and i show the doctor my legs and im like look at this like this isnt right like they were just like concrete like my muscles and my it bands were just unreal it was and again the doctor looked at me and theyre just like oh you need to stretch they gave me some pain meds they gave me some cream they told me to rule things out with this foam roller but one doctor was concerned and he stuck needles in my muscles to see like if there was a nerve thing and that was just so painful yeah they did so much blood work dan i found out really quickly i was really healthy well again ruling out the life threatening the serious make sure nothing horrible is happening okay so i want to connect some dots so in and then this leg thing you said okay youre really stressed out and you dont have to tell me the stories behind it but were you able to now looking backwards say yep these things were going on yes eventually in i got divorced and it was like a month after divorce i woke up with back pain okay and im like one morning like this is different like back has never hurt me my whole life right and it was just like center lower back pain and im like youre going to get through this this is a really hard time youre going to be fine but then it got worse and worse and and then when i ignored all that then thats when the said okay youre not listening to the back pain guess what you cant move your legs what do you mean cant move on they were so tight that again i was just almost a mobile and i would just walk and like you got to walk and i would just keep walking right through it but at that point i had to really do the work which it wasnt just reading the book and telling myself im healthy anymore it was the serious like i got to figure this out now because of that but by this time when you first found out about this stuff there werent that many resources out there right yeah facebook youtube podcast all that stuff wasnt there but by when was the back and like thing really kicking in later was when my legs cramped up and it took about almost a year year and a half for that to go away but again at that point there were more resources available online for you to start seeing other types of tms type of protocols i read the books again and then most recently in like so i was really good for like two years i was completely fine i was running i was in going to the gym i lost pounds of it was great and then i started a new job and i like started to hurt again stress yeah so at that point that is when i want to say the podcast totally saved me because i just listened to the success stories over and over again i listen to all the interviews of the pain doctors and the back surgeons saying how we recommend these surgeries they dont really help you right i read all the success stories where people have their back shattered from accidents mine and they heal so i i knew i had to do a quick turn around and i just i listen to anything i could possibly listen to and i feel just listening to that its almost different than reading the books because like youre hearing the word coming in from a different modality i have taken that in and also the community with facebook sure and the groups and just like i think through helping other people you help heal yourself too thats whats important to me which is whats keeping me pain free yeah for sure yes now im just like it was my mind a few people suffer and i just do want to help people thats fine just like the of the people that came in to him that didnt want to get no think they were not cured other that believed him saying okay please help me well thats theres no choice everybodys got to make when you presented this information and you say this could be whats going on but there are plenty of people that are not ready to hear that there are plenty of people that look at this and say youre calling me crazy youre saying its all in my head youre saying im imagining it which nobody here is saying that at all like monica and i both know beyond you know beyond many people that none of this is fake none of its imagine the pain is extremely real its not in your head its in our bodies we feel it the pain is very real its just created by the brain as opposed to a physical injury fall or abnormality but some people are not willing to accept this and i think theres a phenomenon where people actually say i cant accept this because if i do then that means this is my fault i brought this on myself and ive heard that ive had conversations with my mom and my sister has had some issues with neurological symptoms and my mom was like but you know its not her fault nobody ever said any of this was anybodys fault like you didnt bring any of this on yourself its just where you ended up based on your life up until the time youre based on all the stuff that was going on your nervous system your brain and all the experiences youve had prior you got to a point where it just happened it wasnt anybodys fault it just happens and the great news is if you can open your mind to this there is a way out i mean several of your experiences could have literally disabled you for the rest of your life and you chose to accept the fact that no something else is going on my body is okay im healthy im young im not like years old theres no reason for me to hurt this bad or be this tired or whatever and so kudos to you because you refused to accept the doctors diagnosis and prognosis for a lifetime of suffering and when youve got your hands on accurate information this isnt false hope this isnt like believe it and all sorts of woo woo stuff this is accurate knowledge of how the brain and the nervous system works but you took the leap and said this makes sense for me and so i give you all the credit in the world for doing that and then each time something new came up you just stood back up and said nope im not laying down on this im not taking this and you continued over and over again i dont want to use the word fight the fight but literally just continue to teach your brain that okay this is a new thing but its the same thing showing up in a different way thats fantastic good for you anything else you want to share yeah any more to the story or any words of encouragement or i mean whatever you want to share if anyones in doubt and they say this is just poke poke i believe its fine i get that a lot yeah it says science so the first thing that i connect was like my brain take my emotions and makes my hands let when im nervous my brain takes in fear and makes my face flush what im embarrassed my body controls all of my hormones making everything happen that needs to happen my body when its supposed to happen right so my brain is controlling my hormones and like my brain is able to control is happening if its going to make me sit or bring my immune system down or make you tired or it says science positive for something like its doing it thats just so real i think a key phrase is that emotional events cause physical events so when we cry we literally shoot liquid out of our face i mean its ridiculous like mike said you blush with palms a nervous stomach i mean people getting up to do public speaking literally throw up before their public speech you know you getting a near miss car accident what happens boom boom your hands are shaking these are physical events that are created by emotional experiences so why not pain why not fatigue why not muscle tension its all the same thing anything that the body can create due to illness injury whatever the brain can create is the brain is controlling the whole darn thing so yeah this is not who this is absolutely brain science physiology the interaction between the brain and the body and people say oh the brain and the body are connected no its one system it is one system theyre not just connected so that was a great point i also found fascinating in sarnos first book was he talked about notes that were invoked carpal tunnel he talked about that how like in the seventies everybody was having alters where they all go im sorry ill let you talk ill shut up connection its so its just amazing so theres a lot of things that i feel that as a society were absorbing these symptoms and illnesses and we pick it up i have the tender points as fibro i have you know just facilitating fatigue thats different than being tired which it is yeah that css was so real it wasnt oh im feeling sleepy like your home body just just down like its like a weight is on you well again if you look at it this way the brains job is to keep you safe and keep you alive and if the world is too intense and scary and dangerous whats the best way to keep you safe dont leave the bed dont leave the bed thats where youre safe were going to live in this little box called your bedroom and you dont leave and you can never be harmed again because you dont leave and thats the brains maladapted way to try to keep you safe it doesnt make sense no but it does make sense when you understand that the brains purpose is literally to keep you safe from all of these perceived dangers like the rejection and the social everything in a marriage that you were concerned with all that stuff so you brought some really good insights here this isnt just a story i mean youre connecting the dots from like the theory and sarnos work which is great because some people dont seem to understand it at the level you do and another point two is that when you think of that your brain is helping you and its doing its job and you think it and say thank you youre kind of like keeping me on track i know this really sucks and this is just so dumb but this is like what youre supposed to be doing is with your fight or flight syndrome keeping you but then theres also you know the thank you brain i know youre protecting me but youre going too far i dont need this much on but people literally have those discussions with themselves in their own brain and you can almost like negotiate with the brain and say look i can handle rejection social awkwardness a stressful job you dont need this much protection yes thank your brain because your brain is your best friend been protecting you since the moment you were conceived and it will tell the moment you die great point anything else you want to share some good stuff i feel that those major life events though has helped me just through my day to day to notice and just really understand like how my body works and reacts like i know a headache isnt normal but i also know i dont have a brain tumor im going to be okay but i am fascinated with how it does come up with different ways to present itself and its just its amazing but im just super thankful for everybody whos continued this work ive definitely seen an interesting shift in how things have progressed in the last years how theres more research theres more advocates theres its just going in the right direction but were still not there yet right so what i notice is many of the medical doctors who get into this type of practice are those medical doctors who have experienced these chronic pains or other chronic illnesses themselves kind of came face to face with the fact that the modern medicine didnt help them either and they were even doctors so they had to shift and then a lot of the tms coaches and therapists out there virtually everybodys got their own pain or symptom story which has compelled them to get into this work i mean that was me i had years worth of back pain sciatica and you know became fascinated with this stuff when i was in my you know early thirties took me to my mid forties to get out of it now im in my mid fifties and still paying free i dont think i have a choice my only choice is to keep on talking about this stuff because im fascinated and took me years to figure it out on my own and i dont want it to take years for anybody to get better because with all the resources that are out there you dont have to take that long that five years i lost of my life i described my house as like pompeo everything just stopped yeah and like after i came out of it after five years i was like finding stuff in my backyard that just for i just left it its just unreal and i really hope that no one has to suffer that one yeah thats great and i really think that this particular video will make a significant impact for people with fibro and chronic fatigue because those are some areas that theres so much resistance to this work in the community and primarily because mainstream medicine doctor google wikipedia webmd say there is no cure get used to it the best you can do is manage it and theyre wrong and youre not the only one theres countless stories of fibromyalgia success stories i had all the fiber i had all the css books and i would read them and just be a maze so im like oh my god thats me this is like my whole life they were describing my symptoms that just came out of the blue to such great detail that i was coming css fiber mine out right so what its real but then i was just searching im like whats the supplement whats the thing i need to eliminate from my diet thats going to help me i will do anything those things dont work i drove as far as i could to so many doctors that i could possibly find because i was just at the end of my rope and i tried and i listened to everything they told me i took everything he said and i got no release well again when youre going to people who say they dont know what causes it and there is no cure all theyre trying to do is patch things and help you quote unquote manage things right but sarno actually offered a cure a legitimate honesty god cure because he finally figured out the true cause of these symptoms and when you know the true cause you can resolve the cause because treating symptoms will never work because youre ignoring the cost so fantastic i love it great i think this was awesome thank you for coming on and thank you to personally theres some times where im really just not having a great time and just the rating and the feeling that like the affirmation it helps and i just made such a huge impact on me and able to like really yell me and im just completely grateful that i have an amazing life now and thats cool and a little shout out you did mention nicole sacks the calls work and her community and her podcast was very helpful you mentioned my videos you mentioned other podcasts were there any other podcasts that were like you listening to eddie durable podcast okay securable app really helps give me that break through when i was like my darkest hour with the leg pain i would just line into the app and i did it every night i listened to all the doctor interviews all the success stories i did so word swapping and has coconuts or whatever and literally with them i want to say three months

jonathans tms success story sports symptoms and fibromyalgia,yet another tms success story this time jonathan from new zealand speaks about his journey with chronic pain and recovery,hey this is dan with pain free you and today im here with jonathan from new zealand of all places the other part of the world and he agreed to kind of share his story a little bit hes had a lot of success with not just this mind body tms concept but also with implementing a lot of the things that i share in my videos and some of the concepts that i share and so jonathan was willing to get on here and share a story with some folks on the internet and ill be sharing this within my youtube channel facebook channel and my audience to hopefully help inspire people to say stuff is real and it works and i always say in my success stories i post im like this stuff works folks so jonathan is here to just kind of share what his journey has been like and so thank you jonathan welcome i appreciate you and setting it up if you would let me know kind of a little bit about your journey you dont have to start when you were a kid we dont have to get into childhood and all that kind of stuff but when did you really start running into some problems with some chronic pain and what was your journey through the medical world and all that kind of like lead me through it but it can be a higher level view if you dont want to get into all the it started in and what is so to but before i was born in so in plus twelve and until theyre not at no tms symptoms at all that i was aware of right and i was really into athletics and rugby which is sort of like football without helmets yeah cricket which is sort of like baseball with a vertical bat really into tennis table tennis and athletics and so i was super at that was me at twelve and i dont think this is a time to go into it but there was issues and so i think there was a fear well i know there was a lot of trauma that was in there for myself and my two siblings and so i think that laid the groundwork for and over reactive sort of emotional state or lay the groundwork for tens but anyway i wanted to get better at rug because that was sort of my nature and at twelve i started doing road work where i run for three to miles kilometers im buried in my shoes and after a month or two i noticed that my heels are a bit sore but i kept going because thats what you did and after six months i realized that each week it was getting worse and so i thought ill stop until it gets better and and it never did and that was the start of dms sure so you get around doctors and they were like no growing plates i dont really know and so basically this process occurred from twelve to years of age the where a new injury thing would then get entrenched as a new tms symptom so i went to my ankles into my knees name when as swimming i was a swimmer i line swimming middle of the back and again as i thought these were all injuries that were piling up that were physical and just wearing healing and nobody told me different so i just keep tracking along and removing things from my life to carry on and then at i played squash which i didnt play and strain something in my lower back and at that point the tms went into what sort of got called full blown fibromyalgia which im sure youve read off we no longer was intermittent and you know i could affect it by stopping doing things it was there all the time very painful and spread through my whole body and then started to affect my mind with brain fog and chronic fatigue started to kick in about ten years later as at the pain had gone into my arms or the brain loop or the tms i use slightly different language so what if i decide the team is the best way to know whatever you want to use thats fine okay iwi watched your interview with dr shrub whats how do you say his name hubner how he talks about neural loops or something he calls about neural pathways yeah you can just call it tms mind body syndrome neural pathways are the mechanism in the brain for how the signals for pain are sense overall the concept is generally known as tms okay dr sarno called it yeah so around the age of i finished i was a high school teacher for two years and i think the stress of being a high school teacher for two years in public school i thought i was doing well and people were telling me i was doing well but then i hurt my back and then it spread through my whole body the times stuff right and at the time i still thought it was just a physical thing but i was ready to most people who go to university in new zealand then go to england back in the eighties and work for a period of time because were allowed to and just travel around europe so i did that but it was at the same time that i had got my full blown tms symptoms where through my whole body but i didnt have product fatigue and i didnt have brain fog yet as any of my systems those things can come along so at what point did you finally learn about this dr sarno and tms the mind body concept for a long time so this was mid eighties then i was in london for four years went to meet a woman with went to san francisco supposedly to get married and do all that stuff that didnt work out but i met someone else and they were irritated by my tms it was all my relationships so you know people but everyone was retired above my team made suspiciously made and the girlfriend gave me dr sanos book and at first i was insulted which im sure is a common reaction of course you know its that whole shaming on the pain is not real do today you think its all in my head do but i read it this was a and i did want to see and it worked but i just couldnt believe it i just couldnt believe there wasnt serious tissue damage causing it and i just i got friday other things and i didnt have its not like it is now where i could go and watch you on youtube i think if you if you transpose that version of me to now being able to watch your videos i would have got better yeah well the difference is thats also when i was dealing with stuff okay and there was no facebook no youtube no podcasts no plethora of tms coaches and experts and therapists it was a lot less prevalent back then yeah and it was sort of a fringe theory i would imagine back in right like you would i wasnt getting a lot of intelligent people telling me yes this is the way to go back then whereas you do now sure and so it sort of fell off the map but i knew i sort of got the there was a lot of mind body connection involved in what i had and so i started doing a lot of the things you know like im a scientist and so i started meditating and doing tai chi using stress just noticing that like this is part of you know transforming myself with the mind body connection stuff when i noticed that i might be starting to overstimulate myself in a way that i know trigger some of my symptoms just slow down okay all right so that went on so i basically fell off that and i did various other things with some success but then and i i was teaching and i got a lung infection and two weeks after the lung infection was sort of jokingly called covert because i got sort of what might be called long covert now which turned out i think to be im sure it is tms thing where after the infection was gone still felt like my lungs were really sore and so i lost my voice for two and a half years and couldnt breathe well for over two and a half years from so i was in bed for two and a half years from to about six months ago wow and then i started to feel a bit better ninja started to randomly do things that were helpful started taking the dog to the dog park and started playing like getting in and interacting with the dogs and with the people and i think that was good for just sort of getting me out of the really entrenched tms loop that ive gotten i noticed symptoms were beta and then i used to do ocean swimming every day so i started going in the ocean and i do one to one tutoring but because i lost my voice i had to stop that but i started doing that again had a whole contact with human beings who didnt force me to talk to them started contacting people again and then i found out being in february this year so its not that long ago thats when i got i am did some hill work or something near the dog park i went up the hill it was a bit like the hell thing but each day it felt a little bit worse i mean after six days my kellys tendons felt like they were seriously damaged so i went to the physio and now i said whats up with my achilles and they said oh yeah a little bit a little bit we stop whatever gave me some exercises to do and then she talked to me a bit more and she said we need to watch a video and i actually wasnt dr sano it was another one theres a group and adela the noi group that do a mind body connection thing okay and it was an hour and that has included some because id seen this guy about three or four years ago and he convinced me that it was mental but he didnt but he didnt lie out i think the sort of person i was with the scientific training i needed it really clear like this is what happens in the brain this is how the neural pathways are produced and it was so clear and obvious that this was my life and finally i couldnt i couldnt i couldnt discount it in the way that i did and i knew a lot more was that laura mosley it was laura okay yeah hes a great pain scientist and hes all over the internet so its interesting he talks about a lot of the same stuff but hes not quite as optimistic as our ability to get rid of it he says it takes a long time and hes brilliant in describing what goes on but he doesnt seem quite as convinced that its easy to fix and thats where i differ because a lot of people get great results fairly quickly when theyre able to turn down the fear and take the attention away from it and he thinks its a much longer process the physio told me that she had to doubt she probably will see this sorry she told me she doubted that id be able to get fully well because of my age and because it must be very intrigued because i had it since i was twelve i was appointed by that i started watching it anyway so i just started doing the things and i came across your videos and thats like finally basically so youre about to get a we plug i had that were in america yeah so you got to get a we plug because its all very well and as a scientist i mentioned it a few times because its sort of how i have sort of functioned and navigated my way through this its all very well being told okay this is what it is and this is what causes it but what am i going to do right and then i really liked about your videos as very come and you just explained it really simply no judgment but it was really clear what i need to do so i and each month i got a little better and i started to say to friends gang you have dont count your chickens until theyre hatched in america yeah i dont want to count my chickens but i knew this was different and i got quite depressed when i was so sick and couldnt breathe for two years so i do it yeah it was understandable and ive been through various other physiological tests at the hospital going to emergency rooms i thought i was dying at eric to be honest i thought i was doing sure but i stopped my meditation practice so i started that back up i started journaling and the thing that really changed as i have at the moment im up to sort of not mantras but in my journal like things i come back to when i feel like im a bit stuck or when i meditate right and youre number from may alright attitude of indifference stand bood leo so i do my interpretation of what people say and in my meditation a phrase would come to me where its like this really clicks and this will this will change something in my brain and as there is no tissue damage energy deficit of brain deterioration i can do whatever i want yeah and that came from soreno too no he figured that stuff out decades ago yeah and so i got sans book again i reordered it ive been reading and ive been reading through it and its been great so every month i seem a little bit better it was one thing but i noticed like where the full blown developed was sort of my lower right back and thats always been painful when i drive and i wanted to drive to visit my family who equivalent of driving from san francisco to seattle i guess but on a really windy road and thats sort of like the scariest thing for my brain and my physio i got a special pain physio it recommended me to someone who agreed there was no physical damage and that it was all in my brain and how it was processing my sensations she says you cant hurt yourself drive to visit your family and i started driving and so im driving a lot and it hurt but instead of going into the felo loop that i would have gone into in the past and it would have got worse and worse and worse i went there is no tissue damage so i can just keep driving and i would sort of laugh at it and i dont know if thats in any videos where you sort of laugh at the sensations sure definitely go you know the brains trying to trick me and mostly has this idea that i think youve used as well where you take away some of the shame that gets embedded i think for people with these conditions its not your fault no fault with your experience this is interesting so theres even some emotion there because you know it can be quite a shameful experience for a lot of it definitely has been for me and ive had it for so long and thats been one of the great releases of this is that ive just lost all the shame no its got around my house and around the fact that i got my physics degree when i was but you know summarize i havent done much with it you know the deaf judgments the ways the war so how are you doing now so now each month so im not on the cat couch anymore now i get up at four or five in the morning bounce out of bed watch some videos its mid winter yeah so whats a normal day ive saved home a bit later so its am here normally i get out at the dog park im not wanting to go back in to teach full time im now i dont want to teach full time until im confident thats not going to push me into a clearer right i dont want to lose the game ive made so im not sure whats the concern about putting you into a flare up is it the stress level of working or is it the fear youre going to hurt your body where is your head because if its a fear that youre going to hurt your body then a little more convincing to do that cms is the case yeah i guess the thing with my body is that even now ive still got chronic pain in my body all the time every day but when i first came across this my dear and started working with it four to six months ago was my full body and it was really bad i was having to take narcotics its pulled back to my lower right hip and its sometimes there but i still know its not damaged sure and yeah im give me an idea where you are and where you are now like as far as were gaining functional movement activity your fear levels fear levels of damaging myself as zero so this was a forgotten i wanted to tell you and your viewers this is that as soon as i realized when i watched that video it convinced me there was no tissue damage that it was brain emotional mediated i was instantly cured of the fee pathway which was the most debilitating yeah and this all lives on fear this all lives on fear yeah but my guess is you know like all my tms symptoms just didnt disappear overnight theyre disappearing gradually a reasonably fast based on what the physio or what they would do the physio doesnt completely understand all that stuff no you know more about tms in this mind body process than any of the medical professionals that youve seen thats what they say too in fact a doctor is getting me in to talk to they run a teaching medical center and hes quite keen to have me talk to the final year medical students that come in because hes been very encouraging and when i got this realization i told him i said im going to tell you something youve probably known for a number of years that you didnt really want to tell me because you didnt want to alienate me or whatever i had the feeling that he knew and he did he was very happy for me thats great yeah so i got a good doctor as well which always helps thats cool i just feel like im getting a bit better every month im still swimming in the ocean even though its only degrees ive got a group of people on them whats that group im swimming with ive got eight students i work with one to one to build up their confidence in math chemistry and physics we page and she believes the pit bulls because shes twelve years old and shes got no teeth but shes got the moves and i feel like ive got my life back and i didnt really expect to be honest thats awesome so you got your life back you still have a little bit of discomfort still yeah but your fear level is down and i will tell you that if you can impact your pain levels from being stuck on the couch to where you are now you can get completely pain free yeah i have no idea im certain the more youre willing to be indifferent and say im going to do this even if it does hurt so i noticed that in one of your i noticed that the golf was it are you the golfer no someone was it golfing was it sure of not well i did back in my days when i was still in campaign im not golfing lately this name that you pushed it you pushed it and i was like oh i dont think thats a good idea what it ended there but i had to prove it to myself that i wasnt damaged so even if i had a day where i was stuck on the floor for hours nine days later i went to the golf course and i walked and i carried my golf bag and i played a full round of golf i heard afterwards but i just needed to kind of prove to myself my body is okay this is not a body thing that cure me that didnt cure me but it kept me moving on the tms mind body path so i forgot to tell you i went my pain physio also said the thing that i was terrified of doing was going back in table tennis because it has explosive motions to pull on my lower back and i do sort of like them what do they call it a rep team that not varsity where you play for your state you represent the state sure anyway so my teenage and early twenties like play a line its very explosive i wait yesterday and i played i didnt aggravate my tms because i knew there was no tissue damage so im going to go there so im starting to do those more athletic things tennis again all these things i noticed your talk this morning was about things like stretching and yoga i thought that was interesting but i think chasing the ball is better because it gets you out of thinking something to your body yeah i mean the issue is exercise and sports is all good if youre doing it because you enjoy doing it if youre doing the stretching and the exercise to fix your body because you think your body is the problem thats been causing your pain and you havent bought into this tms concept yet i just wanted to be clear about that i got a lot of comments is probably comments on youtube that i still have to take a look at and get back to you tonight but it was my feeling about it was that if the people who are still doing on doing a lot of those sorts of activities i do think theyd be better off doing some sort of ball sport or something with their mind is distracted so theyre using their bodies and getting themselves healthy but theyre not focused on their body and sort of obsessive way that a tms person can can be the issue is dont try to fix your body theres nothing to fix go have some fun and if you want to play tennis you want to play table tennis you want to go swimming do it because you enjoy those things not because youre trying to fix your body and thats why i went to play golf not to fix my body but because i enjoyed playing golf i wanted to get out with my buddies and play yeah even with the wood the woods but theyre so like because i played so much tennis and cricket i thought i should play golf but anything other than a five iron anything longer than a five iron i cant almost miss the ball completely off is definitely challenging youre trying to hit a little ball with a long stick exactly its not exactly an easy sport and for a while in my s and early i was very obsessive about and i practiced a lot and i got fairly good not great but good but then i stopped practicing and playing a lot and i got worse and worse and worse and eventually got frustrating enough that i said im done and i went back to fishing yeah fair enough so fishing is a lot less stressful well fishings meditation i would imagine oh just being out on the water on the kayak its awesome even if i dont catch anything yeah with the swimming like that in the ocean sure i just wear gloves and hood and boots for the cold yes and you just float out the right thats awesome so any thoughts or recommendations to anybody watching along here as to any encouragement you can offer any suggestions yeah and i think the fact that ive got better very quickly i think i have a lot of advantages in the sense that you know i havent been working so i have been able to focus almost full time on changing my brain and doing stuff that is you know in line with thanos teaching in line with a few of the other people who are in this sort of mind body field meditate every day for an hour or two im in the dog part so just sort of encourage people to know that and you said something in one of your other videos i watched today that was the august it was how to handle a pan symptom or flare up sure and what i would encourage people to do is to treat it like when i say to my students i went through at and this one there was a significant thing you said at at and i didnt write them all down but at i started writing them down you said after you get really angry be angry but then come back and come it gratitude sure what youve given people with your videos is a real holistic program of how to be real be yourself and express your emotions but you cant just stay in anger the whole time either dont live in them yeah experience them let them be felt and let them pass but dont live in them all day long yeah and the other thing and this is just one i just watched it just sort of im not actually looking for specific techniques im just like in general like for people who are sitting here watching this going is this stuff really real does it work i mean what would you say to somebody who was on the fence and moses video because i think he lays out you know and what i said to my doctor i said to my doctor should i have figured that more feel like im about to cry should i figured this out earlier well and he said no not probably not because until recently the functional magnetic resonance imaging that proves these theories are true didnt exist and didnt have the clarity and youre not going to hear this from your doctors even today most of your doctors wont tell you about this mind body concept of them dont understand how pain starts as a result of this mind body concept and they dont know how it becomes chronic and theyre not sure how to tell you to get rid of it like even mosley hes saying it might take six months to a year to get rid of it well then how come im seeing people get better in weeks or months im very optimistic that when you give your brain the right instructions and the right messages of safety yeah it can quickly go good his body is fine we dont need the pain and it can create these new neural pathways of not being pain in pain and its not like youve got to fix the old neural pathways that have been well worn for years you can literally just create new ones around it just like you can learn something new in a weekend right its really good because again i dont always remember exactly where i heard it from it might have been trubner you tell me how to say it thats fine he was saying youve got these old pain pathways and you dont have to do anything with them you can create some new ones where you feel good and happy and positive and they wont have time in them correct yeah and i did a video that says dont fix the old roads create build new ones and thats exactly what we just talked about so so i think at least my perspective is the stuff doesnt have to take years or decades it took me years but i didnt know what to do i was back in the nine there was no help theres no videos youtube facebook podcast none of that stuff existed i had dr sarnos book and it was pages of whats going on and about a page and a half of what to do about it talk to your brain think psychologically reject the physical resume physical activity and i was like okay im doing all that stuff why arent i better and you probably have had the same frustrations like what am i doing wrong why did you believe it though because that was my problem i got it about the same time as you and you believed it i got evidence that it was correct and i wouldnt believe it and they might just be bloody minded was there something that convinced you that it was real that it was the correct take or the take that was going to get you better well i did have some initial results yeah then the pain came back and then i got better and then it came back and i went back and forth a lot but i was like i came to the conclusion that if i could get better after the first time then it wasnt my body so i had some evidence for myself but i got more and more frustrated because i kept coming back and then it would stay longer and then i couldnt get rid of it and then it became more persistent and chronic and so it was a long journey and i made every mistake in the book not in his book but every mistake i know its you know it took me a while to kind of figure out accidentally all the things that im recommending and as i look back and go yeah i got here here here and here and so ill share with you and anybody else watching that this is not complicated we want to give the brain the right messages that were actually safe with our physical body our emotions and even our thoughts and when the brain feels safe these symptoms can fade away right and so if youre going throughout your day and youre having a lot of pain you can actually stop and go what are the messages that my brain is receiving am i worried am i panicked like oh god i want to get out on the bike and i might hurt myself and i might you know are you feeding it fearful messages or are you saying no im going to be good and even if it does hurt i dont care because i know im okay one is a message of danger one is a message of safety and if you give enough messages consistently that youre safe and that even if you hurt so what thats indifference your brain is going to go well hes doing okay hes not too concerned with it and so dont worry about neuroplasticity and brain rewiring and all that kind of stuff because the brain knows how to deal with all that stuff it knows how to handle all that technical stuff if you give it the right information and so for me its consistent messages of safety those four words am i giving myself messages of safety or am i saying well i dont know if i want to get back to work yet because i might hurt can i handle the stress can i handle the standing in front of a class can i hand not really the standing for me it was always more that i would two and two well even people without tms school teachers burn out is that is burn out me just define burnout but yeah where people just sort of go to and i find that with teaching is that i its hard for me to give but heres heres the deal people think i can overdo it and im not allowed to have too much stress in my life and people say well how do i control my emotions so i dont get more tms the issue isnt how can i eliminate stress from my life and how can i eliminate emotions for my life so that tms doesnt take over again the issue is how can i teach my brain that stress and emotions are perfectly fine i still need a very stressful life i still need an emotional life the key is that my brain hasnt associated stress and emotions to mean we should give him back pain again yeah thats interesting so we dont have to eliminate our stress and our emotions to get better we just dont because its impossible the only people with no stress or emotions are in the cemetery yeah fair enough and so i will encourage you to say thats my next day i can do more physically mentally graduated idea and look theres nothing wrong with moving into it gently and not overdoing it because you dont want to have your thought process be the thing that creates all the fear yeah right man if i do more than i did the month before sort of thing and i feel better than i did the month before and i guess i certainly dont want to die its like its going in the right direction i dont want to mess it up sort of a little bit right but evaluate what youre thinking might mess it up and if its fear of well is the stress going to mess it up well okay you can handle stress trust me ive got you know a group program ive got all sorts of individual coaching i also still have another business that i run with my son the desire and the need to publish a video every single day plus ive got family and social and relationship and all sorts of stressors in my life my life is not perfect but i dont have chronic physical pain yeah i dont want anybody to get hung up on the fact that i need to have a stress free life to get better thats not the message at all yeah that teach the brain that stress is not dangerous and that we can do based on how we respond to the pain if the pain happens you can say okay no big deal im hurting today whatever indifference ensuring so this isnt as much of a share your story its almost turning into a little bit of coaching which is very cool yeah no definitely no im definitely getting some pennies drop at the moment thats quite useful anything else you want to share weve been on about minutes try not to these sessions too long yeah no i think the only thing i would say sort of in relationship to that is i think having a daily practice were engaged with these ideas actively i think is important for most people to get better and so not just to think on it i feel okay so i can ignore it at the moment i do think its important even if its only a five or a ten minute or even if its just to watch your video and make a few notes so how can i implement one or two things from this today so you did one thing earlier that i just want to clarify you said well i can almost do this full time i dont want people to get the impression that you need to do this full time because the big message i have is youre not broken to live your life to have some fun do the things you want to do because this is not a full time job to recover yeah so the more time you spend on this the more youre actually convincing your brain that ive got a problem that needs fixing thats true but again one of the things i say often is youre not broken physically mentally or emotionally so theres nothing to fix its just a matter of teaching and youre an educator so teach your brain that youre actually okay already and how do we do that by resuming our focus and attention on living our lives and if the pain shows up okay no big deal how can you say no big deal because you know its tms you know your body is fine theres no tissue damage and so the whole thing works together beautifully that when you take away the fear and you take away the attention from the symptoms and you stop focusing on fixing yourself all day long the brain gets the message pretty quickly that wow look at this look at jonathan hes okay yeah and the whole nervous system and the brain can settle down and the symptoms can fade away so as youve gotten better its because your fear has continued to come down and down and down and hopefully as a result of this conversation and you know continue just watch that you know the daily videos are great because they are a little doses of safety messages yeah its like every day well dan just told me im going to be fine okay i believe him because ive listened to this and its worked for me and you know so consistent messages of safety the daily videos are perfect for that because every day you get to hear some guy talking with a calm soothing voice and smile and its saying youre going to be good where if you dont have that calming influence its easy to get caught up in our thought processes and worries and fears so thats kind of what i have to add to it i totally appreciate you jonathan for coming on being willing to share your journey its incredible that you can go from being completely bed ridden house bound not doing anything for almost two years and now youre swimming in your table tennis and regular tennis i just one to one you know but thats great like you said earlier youre getting your life back yeah just proof that this stuff does work when you can consistently reinforce that message with yourself and its not a thing where its like we believe in this mysterious so this is accurate information this is not false thats right believing in fairies and rainbows and unicorns this is believing in actual science and how things work and when you do and you send the right messages of safety of the brain the brain can go were good and the entire brain and nervous system can calm down and people can get well as youre doing so im thrilled to hear of your progress i think youre just going to continue to get better and better and better and at some point this stuff is going to be like a distant memory where youre not even going to think about it all day because right now youre still in the thick of it where youre like i got to manage my thoughts i got to manage my emotions i no you dont you just go live your damn life when im with other people its or i was always thinking about my pain when i was with other people before when im with other people now i never think about my pain and as a result you probably feel way better too oh yeah im sure thats not because youre distracting yourself with other people thats because youre actually engaged in living your life yeah so when you engage in living your life your brain goes look at that jonathans good hes doing normal stuff this is awesome and it leaves you alone the more you can do that living your life thing yeah stop figuring out how i can fix myself better and better so its going to happen yeah and that is that is what happened has happened or the more i do the better i get so jonathan listen man i appreciate you thank you for sharing your experience and your story and your message of help which is awesome just a little pitch before we sign off if anybody is looking for additional help i do have an online video based course which condenses all sorts of information into one video course and theres weekly group coaching sessions where ill talk to people on a zoom call answer

not youll find my youtube videos go search for pain free you channel and youll find all of my videos there so jonathan thank you again i appreciate you youre a rock star youre going to just keep getting better and better and at one point youre going to not even be thinking about this stuff youre just going to be so focused on sorry i got to show you one thing before we go whats that got to see the page this was the creature the twelve year old had that kept me sort of alive probably for those two years thats awesome your constant companion its great thank you so much and keep in touch

tms success story pelvic pain laura,in this interview laura shares her story of tms and success in using the tms approach to end her symptoms if she can do this,hey this is dan with pain for you today ive got another success story interview for you ive got laura araka here and we dont have just one symptom or one issue to talk about shes actually been diagnosed with up to different things and had a pain journey that lasted three and a half years or so so shes really anxious and eager to not anxious shes eager to share her story because its like so many people who go through this journey and come out the other side feeling great were very compelled to help other people so this is laura opportunity to do that give her an audience and so laura thank you for being willing to share im sure you will be inspiring many people by doing this so im going to shut up and im going to let you kind of tell your story a little bit as to where youve been when you found out about this mind body stuff what that journey looks like and kind of what some of the things are that made the difference for you take it away okay thank you dan i just want to say again thank you for having me here today i found it to be my mission to share my story as much as possible to help women and men with especially pelvic pain and i know we say in the mind body world it doesnt matter what type of pain but i do feel if you can relate to someone saying oh she had this and i have this maybe i can heal from this too so thats why i do this so my journey began actually and i know the date may two nd of because you seem to remember certain dates when youre in that much pain and i started the day just normally like any other day i went running i took my kids to school and then i came back and i went to the bathroom and no big deal and then five minutes later i had to go to the bathroom again and again and i started feeling not right so i said to myself oh you probably have a uti even though ive never had one before so i did what anyone else would do eat some yogurt drink some water and i went away two days later it still was there but it got progressively worse so i went to my primary doctor figure i get an antibiotic and ill be good in a couple of days i went to my primary doctor and he said there was absolutely nothing wrong with me i was completely perplexed like there has to be something wrong with me i must have a uti so the pain got worse over the next week or so and i decided to go to urologist and the urologist did cystoscopy on me which some of these tests that i had done on me were very uncomfortable procedures they put you in a very vulnerable state so i had the cystoscopy done and he also said there was nothing wrong with me my bladder look fine however he did because i was in tears at this point give me overactive bladder medication they did not help so i went back and they did a neurodynamics study which is actually worse than the cystoscopy i didnt think it could get worse and they said there might be some retention so they gave me medication for retention which again didnt work i went to see another urologist who did another euro dynamic study so i had to go through it again and he basically told me i was crazy theres nothing wrong with me and i needed to see a psychiatrist so which was awful because i was in pain something needed to be done so i just went to my car and i just literally stopped just so i didnt know what else to do so over the next few months the pain actually started increasing and i developed chronic pelvic pain and it became worse every single day and some days it was excruciating it actually hurts to sit stand or walk for too long i had a cushion wherever i sat i brought it with me into my friends car wherever i was and i couldnt wear jeans or any type of restrictive clothing and i didnt know what to do it was pretty scary because the doctor said they couldnt do anything however i was determined i was like im going to find the reason for this pain and i went searching for a diagnosis during that time i had a few mris as well so i went to the first doctor and which was a gynecologist and she diagnosed me with pelvic floor dysfunction and pad which was really awful and she gave me botox injections supplements and medications i think it was gabapentin basically i was on again that did not help either one of those conditions with my mris i also went to an orthopedist and a spine doctor they that i had a slight herniated disk they actually gave me a nerve block to see if that was the cause of my pain and it didnt help at all i actually even saw a surgeon for a hernia but he did not believe that that was the cause of my pain too i still have the hernia right now never had it repaired thats important to mention i also then went to a pain doctor in pennsylvania i traveled an hour and a half once a week to see this pain doctor and he then diagnosed me with intersest asitis and i also had urethral inflammation during that time i saw him i had bladder installations and injections during the bladder installations i had to be catheterized for them to put the medicine into my bladder so which was kind of awful and the other thing that i had to do he gave me kids so i had to do it once a week at home by myself so i learned how to do this i didnt get any better it was months driving to pennsylvania and nothing was working i had another mri and they diagnosed me with pelvic floor congestion syndrome and i went to an interventional radiologist to fix this and he said they were the largest varicose veins because thats what that is if you dont know what this is for anyone listening their varicose veins in your pelvis and he said they were the largest ones hes ever seen so i went in for a surgery where they went in through my neck and they metabolize my own bearing in veins they went right down my neck and they embolizes these tens and i have coils in these veins as we speak today unfortunately it didnt work and i will make note that i had this surgery and i was awake the reason i was awake was because i was on the doctors had given me canaan at the time so they didnt give me enough anesthesia so i was awake throughout the whole entire procedure so anyway when that didnt work i live in new jersey and i went to two different pelvic pain doctors in new york city there i was diagnosed with potential neuralgia so i keep getting different diagnoses every time i go to a different doctor and they gave me a nerve block and the nerve block actually i had some numbing but it really didnt work at all so i just was going to suffer was told i was going to basically suffer with potential neuralgia for the rest of my life and as you can see im sitting here right now no i also went to another pelvic pain doctor in the city and they gave me i went for two months getting a series of injections into my pelvis and i believe they were called ilio lingual injections and again they didnt help at all then i started going into pain management because i didnt know what else to do and this was my downfall the first pain management doctor i saw put me on oxycode so now i found myself a month later basically addicted to oxycode i couldnt stop taking it and as i found out later taking oxycodone actually its not letting the brains pain receptors work i needed more and more in order to make it work so i was addicted to that i realized i was addicted to that i saw another pain management doctor who put me on low do smell check stone i believe its called to try to help with the pain i realized i was in bad shape with this oxy so i weaned myself off of it and the clone in it wasnt good for me so this wasnt good enough though for me i then traveled to tennessee to see a predental neuralgia specialist and he had this experimental procedure that he was going to do and because i was in so much pain i wasnt thinking straight and didnt make wise decisions and i jumped at the chance to go so me and my husband flew on a plane went to tennessee had this experimental treatment done of injections and that didnt work either i also took a train to washington dc to see another pelvic pain specialist and all she did was give me medications supplements and creams and another mri so this mri that she gave me showed two tarlov sit oh great so i had two carlos on my spine and i called a tarlo is specialist in texas and it was going to take months for me to talk to him on the phone so i wanted an answer i jumped on a plane and i went to texas just so i can meet him in person and see what he said he basically did not want to do surgery he wasnt convinced that this was the cause of my pain so and i wasnt going to jump on another surgery after having the first one i went to one more doctor i went to another gynecologist in new york city and she diagnosed me with endometriosis so i had all these things i definitely did and for those of you that dont know the vomit studies thats what i am a victim of modern imaging technology you know all these things showed all these things that were wrong but they werent causing me pain they were just abnormal abnormalities normal abnormalities that they found in any year old person so i then knew that i wasnt getting anywhere i went and looked at holistic treatments so i did cryotherapy acupuncture extreme diet supplement race i did something called arc wave therapy which if you dont know what that is its like a unit but times stronger trying to get this pain to go away i also continued with physical therapy help explore physical therapy at the time and i had two great physical therapists however i stopped that once i learned about tms what was really the most difficult through this time was the relationship with my family and my children it basically deteriorated i was on all these different medications so it was making me kind of like a zombie and it took its toll on my body and it didnt even work it didnt stop the pain from coming the hardest part was i lost the connection with my children i couldnt even have like my youngest one sit on my lap and i could see the anger and like the resentment building up you know in them it was awful i felt so sad and i was overwhelmed with guilt or being sick and what i was putting them through emotionally i felt very guilty for not to mention the financial burden that i was putting on my family with all these trips to texas tennessee washington yeah there was a big financial burden there too so basically one day it changed i had all this pain i had basically giving up i said i dont know what else to do im just going to have to live with these conditions my year old daughter came home from work she worked at a snack bar at a local pool and she told me about a friend that she knew that used a hypnotherapist and i said what do i have to lose whats the difference i was skeptical because lots of doctors said they could help me in didnt but i said i would give it a try so in july of theyve been suffering basically for over two years i met paton peterson and shes in short hills new jersey and i didnt know it yet that when i walked through her door that she was going to be the one that was going to change my life forever she was different than any other therapists and ill explain that to you in a minute that i ever met her techniques were completely different she didnt care about the diagnosis that i had she said forget all about it and she didnt want to hear about my symptoms and i was like what do you mean i have to tell you about my symptoms they heard but thank god for her because i wouldnt be here today without her so this is what started these aha moments that were going to come i start did my first hypnotherapy session with her and for those of you that arent familiar it was basically just a deep meditative state that i went into and i was able to connect with my emotions a little more and during these sessions i worked on getting rid of my anger my guilt my fear my sadness and all these things i was repressing and i have many people clients tell me im not repressing emotions i didnt think i was either so even if you think youre not you really might be holding them all in and during our first session i was actually able to get the pain down which was incredible to me and i was confused because doctors were not able to do this the pain i will tell you did not stay down but it went down in that one session so that was my first aha moment that something else is going on here and from that point i started keeping track of other aha moments which was pretty cool and it was the first time i was ever aware there actually was some type of mind body connection even though i never heard of sarno yet i didnt know it yet so i took palin told me to sign up for this meditation class and i took a meditation class with this wonderful woman and sussman and she was calm and patient and she was really a great teacher and during the class i really was able to calm my whole system down all these emotions and stresses and traumas had caused my nervous system to be in this light and fight and the meditation for me was nice and common and i noticed the pain didnt go away but the pain was shifting it didnt go to another part of my body at the time but it definitely shifted into nerve pain it would be the reasonable pain one day the bladder pain so i was like theres something going on here and i didnt understand why i will tell you that this didnt happen overnight because i think people say oh i meditated i dont feel better this took time it didnt happen in one week of meditating it took over the course of three months but i definitely was disciplined and consistent and i also did it as much as i could i didnt put pressure on myself to do it but the main thing i did here i didnt do this to get rid of the pain it was really my first form of self care cause i find with people that have pain they really arent having any self care and thats what i gave myself self care and i continue to practice self care and self compassion for myself over time i was amazed with the shift that i had in the pain so i dont know if you can see behind me but this is my meditation room and its important to note this i created this whole room in my house just so i can meditate and i cleared the room out i had exercise equipment and junk and i both furniture that i had to put together pictures i had to hang up all different things and i realized as i was putting the furniture together and really concentrating on the directions my pain went down it went down so thats when i put it together there was another connection and that was a moment number two so now im not only meditated i actually did practice mindfulness and i did this a lot under caitlin and i would just go take walks i was i became a dog walker because i had to do something with my life i couldnt just sit here and feel depressed so i became a dog walker and as i walked i would pick something i could hear something i could touch something i could feel smell taste just to keep myself out of my thoughts and into the present moment i also repeated mantras constantly that im healing i am strong and you know how a song gets stuck in your head well these mantras actually got stuck in my head they were going off on autopilot when i wasnt even saying them i also tried to visualize myself healthy so i did that a lot and i repeated these mantras actually at all different times i repeated them before i went to the bathroom i would tell me tell myself im strong i am healthy going to the bathroom does not cause urethra pain and i did that continuously again not for a week i also did it with sitting down telling myself i can sit down that carlos is dont cause sitting pain that predental neuralgia its not causing my pain there was something there was a connection i was making to everything now this actually is my favorite story which was aha moment number three when i told you caitlin caitlin was different she was different i would wait for caitlin outside of her office and i was depressed i was anxious i was in pain and there was a long hallway she had to go down to get to her office but before she turned the corner she would start playing music and she would literally dance down the hallway so i dont know about how many therapists would do that but she danced down the hallway from me and it was the only thing that made me smile all week and i was very grateful for her and i couldnt even put it into words how grateful and there was no way to repair but this is why the story is important so for three months i learned steps to advance to do for her for her birthday and you say why three months months because im not bad dancer it took me that long to learn so i basically started learning the dance steps and as i was doing that my pain would go down and because i was concentrating on each step and this was something i wasnt good at either but i didnt know it at the time but i was creating and forming new neural pathways in my brain and weakening the old ones but again didnt you really realize that at the time i just knew my pain was going down and then i went to aha moment number four i went to florida for a soccer tournament and now just to mention im not on pain killers this time im not on any kind of medication and as the plane landed in florida my pain vanished it was the most amazing thing it literally went away so i had a great trip two days i was busy going on rides watching soccer and as we got on the magical express i think its called coming back to the airport all of a sudden my pain started creeping up and i turned to my husband and i said oh my god this is happening somethings happening caitlyn is the key to me getting better so i said i better start listening to her now i found i was just online and i found the book by dr schibner im a big dr hubner fan me to unlearn your pain and i read the book and this was a moment number five i read this book and i felt like i was reading just like totally about myself im like oh my god this is me and im like and now im feeling hope im like maybe there is a way to get better even though i was having these aha moments i wasnt completely convinced so i had the tms personality type i had symptoms tms symptoms that were happening in my throughout my life gastritis arthritis sciatica migraines ive had a ton of tms symptoms im like oh my god im the poster child for tms however i wasnt completely convinced so i found atms therapist and i think i found it in the back of his book actually i think theres a listing and her name was wendy newman and she also is a somatic therapist and she taught me tools that definitely greatly impacted my life and im grateful for her as well for this she showed me how basically energy moved in my body and how to identify the emotions that were stored in my body and when i was able to identify the emotion in my body i could sometimes get the pain to go down cool so that was a moment number six now it is very hard and i know because i see from what some of my clients that i talk to doubt its very hard to buy into this and i still wasnt there even with all those aha moments i wasnt there so she sent me to a doctor dr paul at who was in new jersey yet so he basically convinced me my pain was not physical at all and i think i needed to hear it from a doctor i did because i thought the doctors were the end all at the time i dont feel that anymore even though doctors are wonderful people and help people tremendously with different things but he had me just repeat and i did this on my dog walks actually my symptoms are not physical theyre my brains way of protecting me from and i named the things that they were protecting me from one of them was my fear of my daughter leaving for college i was very upset about that then there was some anger issues with some people in my family and i had to while i was walking the dogs i had to actually feel this in my body and then i never heard of you before i stumbled a crush crush you on the internet and i joined your facebook group and as i was walking my dog every single day i would listen to one of your videos and what your videos did was reinforce everything that caitlyn and wendy were teaching me so your videos were invaluable to make it was important to keep the fear down to get the doubt away so those videos helped me tremendously and like i said i listen to them every single day i also listen to books on audible because i could do that while i was walking the dog and i came across this book and im hoping it helps people too thats why i like to mention things that i did that help me the presence process great book i always tell people take out of things what you think help you you dont have to go into the full force so i took out some of the things that helped me and he had a meditation that he used in there and i did that twice a day for minutes but i had to build up to that i didnt just do it all at once but that did help me tremendously at that point i think i accepted this diagnosis i accepted it there was you telling me there was caitlin there was wendy there was dr quad i accepted it so i just started reading as many books as i could and i got rid of all of my pain groups completely totally took myself off the facebook group thats huge yeah huge the only facebook group i was on was yours so i replaced it i love your facebook group because its telling a message to people and giving people hope i also decided to start exercising when i knew even though i walked i was a runner and i stopped running so i decided to slowly get myself back into running i meditated every day i journal and i know theres a lot about journaling people dont like to journal but i did journal but then i stopped and i started using one of the methods you said in your videos i believe if im correct its like an open house for your emotions and i would do that and i said what am i feeling today is it anger and i see if i was and if i was feeling it i say where am i feeling it in my body and then i let anger go out the other door after i was done so i did that a lot along with journaling it was what i felt like that day i also became very conscious of the way i spoke to myself the thoughts that we have are very the thoughts we believe and we focus on are the ones that grow so i started and this is another book i use to the warrior hard practice by heather asamara and its a way to get through your feelings then go to the story and then go to the truth of the matter and your intention so that you can change the way you feel so its a practice that i use with my clients now today and it really really helps you get through your emotions and change your thought process on that when you said you figure out what the emotion is and whats the story behind it and then you look for what a lesson the truth the truth of the matter you name the truth what the truth really is its almost like youre combating those thoughts which is kind of like a lesson that youre learning from that experience the truth of the matter is that you know i wasnt really abused as a kid but i felt neglected exactly and you kind of reframe that experience i see what you mean yeah exactly reframing is the perfect word and what was the last step after the truth to set an intention basically maybe to have some compassion for myself from self love and then you actually go back through the process to see if you forgot any truths you rewrite your story and then your feeling an emotion actually changes where you can feel better about it so its a pretty cool process i also put a plan in place i decided that i wasnt going to i was going to take my power back i wasnt going to let these pain conditions rule my life so i basically had my plan i meditated i felt my emotions and i brought as much joy into my day as possible so i didnt spend the whole day working to get rid of my pain yeah i just thought i said im going to just live my life now im going to live my life regardless if i have team treating it within difference so as well yeah really huge just bringing as much joy back into life as possible and i stopped being hard on myself if i didnt have the time to journal or meditate i didnt punish myself and as you say more often than most see i did listen to your videos i know youre quoting i dont even have to say a word i can just one of the other things i did which was the biggest thing which caitlin had told me were going to stop talking about your pain so i stopped talking about my pain i told the people in my life but i didnt even want them to ask me what my pain was i say all the time yup just so we stopped talking about my pain for like days that was the goal which i did i also kept dancing for those of you that know tik tok i kept dancing and doing it with my kids and it kept reinforcing these new habits you know producing a new neural pathway and weakening that old one i stopped this is really important i stopped waiting to feel good to find joy in my life like i said i took my power back i did what i wanted regardless of the pain one last hurdle for me was forgiveness okay i had to forgive the people in my life that i was angry at and i had to forgive myself and another good book ive read is forgive for good by fred luskin great book if anyones looking needs to work on forgiveness so all these things i did what caitlin when you were teaching me what the things that you said in your videos the more i did the more moments i had so now i will make a comment that every time you put joy in your life it didnt always make the pain go down for me i dont want people to think that because it didnt sometimes i was in pain but what i did was i didnt say oh its not working because you dont want to say that even though its hard to not say that but i took it as an opportunity to treat it within difference and get rid of the fear to teach my brain that this pain hurt me but it wasnt harming me so one point id like to make there is that if youre doing something with the intention of im going to be happy so i can get rid of my pain never going to work your intention is always still about the pain which means youre connecting those pathways and youre using them so i like to say do something fun without any expectation of outcome exactly just do something fun without an outcome im going to just go enjoy a walk in the park because i like walking in the park period has nothing to do with did it fix the pain or not because if if youre doing it for the wrong reason youre always looking over your shoulder going is this pain still there right i just wanted to talk just touch on that yeah no thats important because thats what i did i just said im going to live my life and do it anyway and i dont want everyone to think oh she got better from dancing im going to try dancing no you have to do something you like to do do something you like to do just to get your life back to do what you want to do and put as much joy in your life as possible people ask me all the time am i out of pain and the truth is yes but everyone has pain in life everyone get a headache once in a while or something like that it happens and my body now notifies me when im repressing something or im too stressed out the difference is i dont fear it anymore im curious about it yeah im curious about it i say i talk to myself whats going on and when it does come the funny thing is this is funny sometimes like when i was getting my facebook page together and i wasnt having any more pelvic pain at this time before i published it all of a sudden i got trigeminal neuralgia in my face you had that doctors call exactly didnt get trigeminal neuralgia you had tms in the face temporarily right correct youre correct so i had this facial pain and i was like but i started laughing i literally started laughing i go im going to lay down for a minute im going to take some deep breaths and i connected with the fear that i was feeling because like i said my mission is just to get my story out there and to try to help people with pelvic pain if i can and within a day it was gone yeah because nicole sacks give her a shout out she says theres no cure for human pain but there is a cure for chronic pain and what aura really showed is that she had some significant pain appear out of seemingly nowhere based on how she chose to respond to it with insight knowledge curiosity and lack of fear it didnt stick around and it never became chronic or persistent and thats our greatest strength is choosing how we respond when we do feel a twinge a pain something going on is to say i think i know whats going on you check in emotionally you dont allow the fear to escalate you dont get in the catastrophic thinking and with curiosity you kind of say i understand this this makes sense exactly the promotion of your new page and the response is one of our most powerful tools to taking a symptom and not allowing it to become persistent or chronic great point yeah exactly most of my other tms symptoms since ive done this mind body work have disappeared and once in a while theyll flash back up and i actually start laughing because i think its funny what the brain can do and the more i laugh at it the less i have now a laser light show just enjoy the show exactly pop over there wow cool look at that and im trivializing it because it is can be severe and can be scary but what you learn through this journey is theres really no reason to be afraid exactly exactly so thats what i did i just was like oh thats interesting basically fantastic and it went away and i will tell you i very rarely have pelvic pain today hardly anything everyone i will tell you even before doing this i went to the bathroom three times but i started cracking up i go oh youre just nervous about doing the video i said youre fine and as im sitting here with you now i am fine exactly and you know i just want to point out too that a lot of good things came out of this as horrible as the paid was a lot of good things came out of it im more present with my kids than i ever was i learned to set boundaries i learned forgiveness most importantly i love myself the best thing for me that came out of this and making a joke but i can wear jeans again which is great so there were a lot of lessons i learned i also learned that doctors dont know doctors dont know everything and now i can use all these tools that ive learned in my life you know i dont get too stressed out anymore because i know i need to take the time for myself so it definitely taught me a lot and it also put me in a new direction in life i went and i took dr hubner practitioner training so that i could help people like i said im a big fan of dr shiner i also am halfway through my somatic experiencing certification because thats another tool i really use to help myself get out of pain so if it wasnt for this i wouldnt be taking this other path in my life and you know like i said i had a plan i didnt let it consume my day its hard but its simple it really is simple some of the tools we have to do but i do believe if you just bring as much joy into your life everyone can heal from this it definitely can to take your power back take your power back you know its difficult and i know how hard it is because i can empathize with every single one of you out there thats in pain but im sitting here to tell you i live my life i am basically free of pain just like i said everyones going to get something here and you know every now and again but i have my life back and im healthy and im sitting here today with no pain at all thats awesome so cool yeah it is so cool right sometimes i think its amazing that this actually happens thats a heck of a journey diagnosis to pain free and it really came about from you taking the responsibility for your own health back into your hands instead of delegating it from one specialist to the next from state to state halfway across the country and no offense to doctors but they just have not been equipped through medical school to deal with chronic symptoms right and they only know what theyve been taught and its not their fault theyre great people theyre doing everything they can they mean well but as it relates to chronic symptoms if youre watching this video youre in the right place right tms this mind body syndrome this mind body connection between stressors emotions life events and the onset of chronic symptoms its not a coincidence this is the cause of the vast majority of chronic symptoms pains illness and even things like autoimmune are digestive very much stress induced challenges so do you have anything else you want to share or add no i just want to give im hoping that my story gives people hope yeah i hope so because thats basically my main mission if anyone ever has questions or wants to message me im more than happy to answer anything i answer questions on messenger all the time on facebook for people is that page your name i have my personal page and then i have my business page what is that feel to heal what does it feel to heal yeah feel to heal thats my business page where i just post things you know that i hope can help people so if anybody wants to follow laura and perhaps connect feel to heal and her name again is laura araka haraka correct look her up reach out yeah shes got a great story and as it relates to elvick pain and despite the fact that theres diagnosis it seemed like all of your symptoms were centered in that part of the body exactly they work i think to say that this is a pelvic pain success story and the pelvic pain includes any number of those different potential medical labels theres a great pelvic pain success story thats probably how ill position it when we share it in the thumbnail image and all that kind of stuff because theres a lot of people that go and what about this what about that and does this work i heard tms is just back pain no no no its way more than just back pain it can be virtually any type of pain yeah thats why i mentioned all the different diagnoses because people will say oh i had is is that included in pelvic pain so i wanted to so people can relate to all the different things i had yeah so try not to get too lost into the symptoms medical labels just know that so much is included in this tms the mind body work and you know laura did not have to solve each of these quote unquote individual diagnosis one by she just had to teach her brain she was okay and she did that through not distracting herself with dancing but by actually engaging in life and doing something she enjoyed not to fix the pain but because she was having some fun and decided having fun is more important than fixing myself and at some point you got the aha that said holy cow im not actually broken exactly and you know when you start to get it from here to here it goes from knowledge to wisdom you know things can start happening so from the time you found out about this tms and dr sarno till the time that you kind of felt like you had this like how long was that well i saw caitlin in july of and even though shes not a cms coach or therapist she had the same agenda she knew exactly what to do regardless so i think by the end of definitely by the beginning of i was better yeah but i had a lot of good times once i realized the diagnosis there were times i had no pain for weeks so a year and a half being totally better but during that time it wasnt i had some good moments as well ill encourage anybody whos having some good times and then the pain comes back or it moves stay with it because this is absolutely the right path the fact that pin can go away for a while and then come back or move somewhere else doesnt mean this whole thing is hogwash it just literally means brain still hasnt settled down completely yet and its still doing its tms type of stuff to keep us distracted protect us from some perceived danger or whatever that may be so laura unless youve got anything else i think this was fantastic i think a lot of people are going to i love hearing your story get a lot out of it youve listed a number of resources and ill make sure to i can link up to your facebook page field to heal okay great and on there if you want to do you have like resources that you use i do actually on my website to heal live i have actually a tms resource ford where i have different meditations that you just click on them and some success stories theres a few different things that they can just look at if they like ill try to link those up when i do the posting of this so great i appreciate you if anything else well wrap this up everybody i appreciate you too thank you very much for all youve done for me everybody here thanks for watching leave some comments for laura tell her how much you appreciate or sharing her story and youll have to share your ticktock channel so we can go sure no problem alright thank you okay care bye,1.0
universe works in mysterious ways unexpected success stories manifestation monday,hi my loves in todays manifestation monday i share some success stories that came about unexpectedly if you love,in todays video i want to share somelaw of attraction success stories that show how the universe provides for us invery strained ways hello my loves and welcome back to mychannel if youre new im leo alexandra welcome to the baby elephant communitywhere we talk about the law of attraction spirituality selfdevelopmenthow to be our happiest best selves and so much more so today is monday and ifyou are now used to the new schedule where i post every other day that meansevery other monday we get a manifestation monday where i relate toyou guys law of attraction success stories my own stories my friendsstories my families and stories from the community which i usually get on thefacebook group the baby elephant facebook group if youre not part of thebaby elephant facebook group you could always join that its free to join wehave like almost members there and the link is down below people arevery active on there people are helping each other to manifest giving advicesharing resources its just a really really good little hub of spiritualityand high vibrations so you might be wondering where i am right now this isgonna be the first video i record here in hawaii im in hawaii for the firsttime ever in maui erin insisted that we come here on theway back from japan and im so happy that he did because this place isincredible im recording the vlog so youre gonnabe able to see our adventures here this beautiful airbnb that we got and justwhere we are right now youre gonna see my view actually illshow you my view right now this is what im looking at as i record thisthats incredible im really grateful im really happy and im taking allthese vibes and im transmitting them to you what ive been told is that maui isthe heart chakra of the world so im hoping to create a new guided heartchakra meditation kind of like the root chakra meditation i made if you haventdone that one yet its really good i will link that below for you so you cancheck it out i want to kind of tap into the energy here and transmit thatthrough meditation so im hoping to do that sotodays manifestation monday video i want to share stories about how peopleasked for something from the universe and it provided an interesting anddifferent than kind of strange ways i think that a lot of us might have someexperience with something like this happening where we set our intention andthen were looking for it to come in one way but it comes in a different waycompletely the thing is you have to be very open and very aware in order for itto come to you through other sources so this is how i kind of visualize how theuniverse guides us to our manifestation when we want to learn more here and wewant to be here right there are invisible doorways everywhere all aroundus okay when we limit ourselves to thinking that were only going to getwhat we want to manifest through one doorway we see a physical doorway likethe one i have right here were not letting the universe guide us throughall these different doorways that could lead us to exactly what we wanted sowhat we have to do is let go that physical doorway let go that one doorwaythat we see that we think that thats the only way we can get what we want andallow the universe to lead us through the correct doorway what that means isthere are literally limitless ways for you to receive what you ask for you justhave to be open to it and stop limiting yourself the way we limit our ourselvesis by thinking how am i going to get this when am i going to get this whywhere who thinking in that way limits us immediately our higher self you know whowe really are knows all the countless ways that we can receive exactly what wewant but our third dimensional physical mind is very limited but what byreference experiences it thinks you know i want to live an abundant life how cani live in abundant life i have to win the lottery thats the only way i canhave an abundant life by winning the lottery whereas the universe in ourhigher self knows that there are limitless ways of receiving what we wanti hope that makes sense and it might make a little bit more sense once ishare these stories so last week i was in japanand i really wanted to make a video every day or every other day while i wasthere but i wasnt feeling inspired for the first few days so im like five daysin japan and i still have not recorded a video and i was just like i needinspiration i need inspiration but i realized that when i push myself andwhen im like i need inspiration i have to be inspired right nowi usually just push i push away that inspiration those ideas even further soi decided to be easier on myself and like you know what if inspiration comesit comes if it doesnt it doesnt the thing is before i had this realization iwas looking for inspiration through books so instead of reading is insteadof enjoying what i was reading i was just skimming through books looking foran idea i was going through videos looking for an idea i was very aware inmy daytoday life in my daytoday traveling in japan to see if an ideacomes up but i was almost focusing too much and the fact that an idea wasntcoming up i was focusing on the lack of an idea therefore i was attracting moreof that lack when i let that go of course the universe provided in the bestway possible so it didnt come from another youtuber a video that came up onmy feed or it didnt come up from scrolling instagram it didnt come upfrom any of my books i have a lovely library of books that i often getinspiration from when im just reading for enjoyment but i didnt get that thistime what happened was i had this little breakthrough if youre on my email listyou might already know this story because i share my stories kind of likea diary in my email list and if you want to receive those stories you can sign upfor the free newsletter below the link is below just you get my heart chakrameditation and the daily emails for me are almost daily emails so what happenedwas i went through this sort of healing journey where i realized i alwaysthought of myself as the hero im not a victim im i dont like it when peopleplay into the victim mentality but i realized that i did have my own littlevictim story and that victim story is that people always want something fromme that my friends that people who are in my life are nice to me or come talkto me because they need some for me thats a victim mentality thatsalso just a story i was telling myself and when you tell yourself this storyyou perpetuate it you reaffirm it and that becomes your reality so what i didis i realized i have to stop affirming this victim mentality and i have tounderstand that people come to me because they value my advice they valuemy wisdom and they just want to talk to me they want to you know have me intheir lives and its not because i give them anything maybe it is because i makethem feel certain ways but its because of who i am as a personnot just because of because they need something for me and especially when itcomes to my friends and my family thinking that way its just going to getme into this deeper and deeper victim hole so anyways i went through thislittle healing thing where im like ok people love me for me its not justabout what i do for them and then the next day this was all in japan the nextday an old friend who used to be very very close to me we used to be likesisters she reached out to me and what she said was can you please send me avideo about self love a video of yours about self love or like loving yourselfagain and i had two things i had several ways i could respond to this i couldhave been like oh woe is me see she wants something from me again she needsme it i could kind of tell that she kind of wanted me to ask like whats going onso i could have gone into victim mentality been like see everybody alwayswants something for me or i could be there for my good friend who needed me icould step up for her so i decided to do that and i talked to her for a fewminutes thats all i really took to bring her back to a place of selfloveand to give her a program to do for herself a game plan a plan of attack toget back to a place of self love and you know what that did when i put myself tothe side for a second and decided to not be the victim and to step up for myfriend it gave me inspiration the second i was done with that i created of mymost recent video on selflove which will be out next week if youre watchingthis video when i was posted it inspired a nearly minute video that wascompletely channeled it was all about love unconditionallove of self and if i hadnt talked to my friend if i had just um incompassionately uncompassionate li sent her one of my videos on self love one ofmy older videos and i hadnt stepped up and been there for her i wouldnt havereceived that inspiration and just like that i got the inspiration for the videoand i started to get inspiration for other videos as well i was able to makethree videos in that day because of how inspired i was for my conversation withher so sometimes the universe provides in the most magnificent ways i want toshare a couple of stories from the baby elephant facebook group i actuallyreceived like stories but you know i have to pick and choose so that thesevideos arent minutes long so this is a very short one its shortened to thepoint but it kind of shows what the theme of this video is very simply veryplainly and very thoroughly so there one a baby elephant her name is giorgiashe wrote that she asked for the universe for more money to come to herfor about a week so shes been asking for a week for more money now like i wassaying in the example sometimes we think oh im not gonna get more money unless iwin the lottery or somebody just decides to give me the moneybut the universe will provide in several different waysgeorgia just got a second job and now shes getting more money so it happensin that way you set your intention if you stop attaching yourself to howyoure going to get it youre going to be able to receive it from all thesedifferent avenues and it didnt have to come as a as a second job it could comefrom so many other ways it could come from a new idea a new opportunity justso many different doorways are out there for us we dont have the capability ofcomprehending all the different ways in which we can receive what we desire thentheres this other story from a vector lecter one another baby elephant i likethis story because it goes to show you that even when youre thinking liketheres probably possibly no way for this to happen how could it possiblyhappen in this real things still seem to happen so im justgonna read this to you so in high school i was mostly the top student for myexams and subjects in my first year i had chickenpox and i couldnt go toschool to do my final examinations for two weeks i felt this appoint andfrustrated it felt like all my hard work from studying all went down the drainduring my time at home i just asked the universe if it could help me maintain myclass position and my grades i thought it wouldnt really make sense how cansomeone who didnt take any of their exams still be the top student but istill trusted the universe despite the odds very important to how about faithfast forward two weeks after my chickenpox were almost gone i receivedmy results and realized i was the second top student honestly it didnt reallyseem fair to my other classmates but my teacher said that my previous test andassignment grades were pretty good and they used my grades to judge how well iwould perform for my exams doctor had no idea that this would happen this was afew years before i knew about the law of attraction my advice would be never losehope because miracles happen every single day i also have trust in theuniverse and stay in a high vibe usually by listening to kpop to stay ina high vibe i feel you babe and i would love to have a shout out shout out todr lecktor i think thats

peer coach success story reducing antipsychotic medications,miami shores nursing rehabilitation center peer coaches share how they reduced their rate of percent of longterm,i am very excited to tell you about our antipsychotic reduction program our facility is beds and designated scale beds long term beds we took onthis effort in because we were one of the facilities that had the highestrate of antipsychotics and we wanted to do something about it the don and i met i met with the interdisciplinary team and our goal was to reduce our offlabelantipsychotic use when they first met on this for me personally i thought it was a crazy idea so i said ok its going to be easy i dont agree with itbut i would give it a try so when i buy into it then i have to go talk to my staff and its exactly what i said they said that its crazylets give it a try we have to try and that is how we came into theprocess of wanting to try the antipsychotic reduction we have beentrying to communicate with the specialist and the psychiatrist in order to reduce the use of antipsychotic medications by implementing various activities forthe residents in the national and we have been having the success rates byreducing antipsychotics and reducing the falls and other complications thatthey can have by using the antipsychotic medications this is a model that i guessevery other nursing home and rehab can follow you know in order toreduce the falls reduce other potential hazards the black box that we alwaystalk about it was more about individualized care and less aboutreducing antipsychotics so we were surprised to find out after six monthsthat our rates are suddenly our rates were below in the state and once werealized that we were having all these positive outcomes we started to pursueit even more because we knew the result was positive for all our residents what we found out was that taking them off the medications were not causing themto have more behaviors it was doing the opposite it was giving them more life tosee them participating more in activities to see them moreoutgoing to see them more engaged to see the staff more engaged with them soconsistent assignment was also one of the things that we implemented becausewe found out that when residents with dementia have consistency they tend tohave less behaviors we all knew our residents and its just a whole culture for the facility the family we noticed that our families were more satisfied when wecall them its more of a family they seem to care they care about him andthey care about us theyre very nice people here theyre very caring and they like him they like him they get along real well you are my sunshine my only sunshine oh he loves music he goes to church everysunday and they involve him in church he sings he loves to sing whenhe had his memory he used to sing happy birthday to everybody here that had a birthday out here in the front in the lobby ill think of you each day and when i dream when i am away but thats it thats his most favoritething he likes to do is sing knowing hes being taken care of i dont thinkhe wouldve been living today if he hadnt come here and got the care that he hashere the staff is just wonderful here i trust them with my brother i really doand he likes them and thats important too cause ill ask him you want to go someplace else no no no no no he likes it here i brought her here because of her dementia and that shes awalker and she disappeared a couple of times which scared me so i brought her here so shed be safeasked for her to be treated well you know for her symptoms for her to be happy and smile when i come in theyll involve you in all their activities the best thing was the staffing and how well they take care of her and how better she is from when she had first came here shes much better shes not medicated all the time thats a plus i had a special moment when she was heremaybe three four years and she was voted queen of the nursing home you had a king and queen i have pictures to show but she was voted queen and that was special to me that they liked her like that she loved it so this is what we started out to do in the beginning we had our quality assurance meetings we came up with a plan based on the plan we came up with goals for the residents based on our assessment and we implemented those plans the implementation of our interventions wasin place and then we followed through to see what worked and what didnt work but the common team that came back to us was individualized care,1.0

husband and i were watching a movie and all of a suddenringing in my ears started i didnt know what itwas about or anything so thats when my journey started and i visited with my enti went to two of them and all they couldrecommend was hearing aids and it was a pretty frustrating experience because i got the hearingaids and they couldnt offer any other counseling or anything else so i worked on that for a while and then i went to another clinic that specialized in reallypeople with menieres disease but through that i gotconnected with some gentleman who helps by hypnotizing people but that didnt work for me because im a verygogetter kind of person and i cant have a hard time relaxing and what i needed was somebodythat could kind of train me with cognitive behaviorskills or tinnitus retraining and i came across you guys through youtube and i just started listeningto some of your cast and then i signed up and it was just like it turned everything around my whole mindset of how to deal with this the fact that you knowalthough its not curable you can be taught how to live with it and thats so important when you are feeling very hopeless you know that this will never end and i just found it so beneficial the things that you taught me the skills that your audiologist taught me and its just opened upa whole new world for me and i just want thisexperience to share it with other people thank you lynn and tell us about over thetimeframe that you worked with us and over the timeframe that from when your tinnitusstarted to where you are now how much time has that been and how has the intensity of your tinnitus changed over time well you know initiallyill be honest with you it sort of i was reading a little bit on my own about cognitive behavior so it started in january and then in may of thatyear my home flooded we moved and my home flooded and it was a very stressfulexperience because you know it took us about almost ayear to get back in our house and we had some lovely friendsthat let us live with them but it was a very tense time plus i had a very stressful job and so the tinnitus came back and it came back with a vengeance and thats when i came acrossyou guys when it came back and it kind of you know you guys taught me how toget it back into perspective and get a better handle on it and so its almost been two years ill be two years in januarybut ive been better i think i contacted youall about four months ago and worked with you alla good almost two months and then i kind of felt so much better that i could kind of handleit on my own but yet i had the reassurance thati could call you all back anytime i needed any furtherhelp or instructions plus two you all givea lot of good tips you know through emailand i like your podcast too and those are the kind ofthings you need to have you know to continue on apositive journey with this yeah you really have showna positive journey with this and were happy to celebrate that and to showcase that tothe rest of our community because that hope thatoptimism that encouragement the motivation thats hugeto get over the mental emotional psychologicalblocks that can sometimes come with living with constantringing in your ears in your head right so you said that you learnedsome valuable skills you said that you gotsome tangible techniques skills things you can do what were those thingsthat you learned working with a specialist from treble health what were those tinnitus tools that you put in your toolkitto help you better manage this okay one i got a recommendation that i get sound therapyadd it into my hearing aids so and that works really good when youre in that quietarea of time sometimes you can turn it on thatyou know that sounds and that kind of takesyour mind off of it so that was a real goodpiece of information that i learned from you guys and then learning how to relax we did a session on that you know how to relax and bringing you know getting in a relaxed feeling that kind of lowers itand helps you manage it and then behavior the way you think and you deal with this is the major thing the thought patterns that i was coached on by the audiologist were justthose were just game changers i love that so what are those quietsituations for you you mentioned that thesound therapys very helpful when youre in quiet situations for you in your average day it seems like youre in anoffice setting right now do you work in an office is that the quiet situation that was most challengingwith your tinnitus yes i work in a office and you know its busy the phone ringsand things like that but there are periodsyou know length of time where theres not anysound and sometimes you know it might comeback and then i just click on the hearing aid andim fine with the sound yeah thats a common situation then im sure many of our listeners here are also looking for help in quiet places if youre watching this on youtube please comment below helpful so lynn and i know that this story this motivational success story with tinnitus is helpful for you lynn you mentionedthose behavior changes those mental strategiesnot reacting negatively but instead changing their reaction changing their response in a matter of months youve shown that your braincan habituate to tinnitus was it a impact of tinnitus did the volume also change tell us about yourhabituation over those months was it just the awareness and how much tinnitus isannoying you or impacting you and how did the volume if at all change during those monthsthe volume of your tinnitus okay with the thought pattern changing my reaction changed to it the body didnt get all upset you know how the bodyyou know like that fear like oh its backoh my god oh my god well once when you lookat it in a different way and you know its notgoing to be anything that youre not seriously ill you know just thinking about itin a different manner the volume of it just decreases to something that sometimesim not even aware of it you know its just themindset and how you react to it for me is more important than anything i love that and thats very in line with what the research supports as well that having cognitivebehavioral strategies is so important to promote habituation and in your case you pairedthat with sound therapy so our experience were a group of audiologists at treble health we work via telehealth nationwide and when someone comes to us those are the two majorthings that we try to get as your foundation for care because the cognitivebehavioral strategies those mental strategies forhow to live better with this they actually help you reduce the sound its counterintuitive some people might not understand but those mental strategies actually help get to the goal of improved tinnitus and then the sound therapy as well those sound therapies that we use devices on the ears that are programmed for tinnitus sound therapy like those that areoffered at treble health like those that can also befound at certain clinics when theyre programmedspecifically for tinnitus by a specialist who is an audiologist who works with tinnitus patients a lot then the success of usingsound therapy is very high and in your case youre showing that when you paired both of them together this tinnitus spike that was real and annoying and loud thatlasted a period of time you were able to retrain yourbrain after a few months and the sound has gottensofter too it sounds like so this is just a really good case study for anyone listening of the benefits of both of those strategies do you have any otherwords of wisdom lynn words of encouragement words of wisdom for someone else who may be inthe the position you were in back months ago when this was loud and bothersome and causingyou to really think about oh my gosh i need some help what should i do yes you know the fact is too whats more importantis that you get sleep because you know itskind of like a thing that kind of piles on each other if you dont get your proper rest and youre tired and itmakes you a little weaker so the most importantthing i worked on too was going to sleeptrying to get to sleep and i would take and put that music or wear earplugs and to have that sound which got me back intoa good sleep cycle too i was using sound again to sleep so once i was able to get mysleep patterns more concise you know i was a littlebit stronger to move forward with you know learning theother thinking techniques not letting my body get all upset and it all just kind of came together i mean its kind of strangewhen you start you know make sure you get your rest and then dont let your body get upset and you know that this tinnitus is not going to kill you you know and that you can learn tohabituate and live with it its a skill and its you know its not difficult to do butit does take a lot of work and reframing the way you think does that make sense absolutely that makes sense and to be clear for anyone listening those skills that come youcan learn some of them online at your own pace there isa selfhelp method for this but the premier way to gethelp which is what lynn used is working oneonone with a specialist and the truth is that therapistspsychologists therapists theyre the bestcounselors in our society theyre the best counselorsin the professional community but they may not knowthat much about tinnitus and most of the anxiety here in our community is about tinnitus so sometimes working with other therapists can be a challenge for tinnitus because they might notknow all the nuances of how tinnitus works andwhat can be done about it theyre going to provideexcellent care for anxiety sleep stress otherforms of talk therapies however sometimes you justneed questions answered about your tinnitus not so much anxiety in other parts of your life so an audiologist whos well trained in tinnitus can sometimesbe a much better counselor for someone whos strugglingwith tinnitus than a therapist now many of our patients use both at the same time and thats okay too im here to simplyshare some pros and cons and some consideration so anyone else whos listeningcan make their own decisions because thats all that we care about is providing high qualityinformation to help with your health literacyright with your health outcomes but lynn is that what you noticed here tell me if im wrong that an audiologistwhos very well trained in tinnitus can really answerall the questions you have and provide that targetedcounseling for tinnitus absolutely yes because im just goingto share this with you i live in a pretty large townand there was not anybody who was really specialized in tinnitus im serious till i found you guys and then it was just sogood to have a conversation with somebody who knew and understood this and could explain whythis is happening to you what you can expect and yes its not a hopeless thing like oh youve got tinnitusyou have to live with it well you have to getsomebody to teach you to instruct you how to live with it im sorry you do i mean and ive talked toso many people that have it and they said god iwish i could find somebody that could teach me how to live with it i said its easy andi give them treble health but thats the good thing and what i want to tell you this too after you have your sessionsyou were always so good the audiologist and sending you a summary of what we discussed so you know you didnt feel like youhad to just make sure you were grasping everything after the session wasover you got an email of the summary ofeverything that we discussed and also some alternatesources and resources so that was very valuable too yeah lynn you shared somuch and were very supportive of your continued health and success if you want to ask lynn a question or ask us a questionyou can do two things number one you can let us know by leaving a comment onyoutube underneath this video if you have any followup questions from this interview with lynn

type i diabetic childs amazing success story,get access to my free resources full success story here watch,i want to just get your story its just incredible i read it i literally cried so um i just wanted to uh get it straight from you incredible story about lilliana so um can you tell me just a little bit in your own words what what happened initially i know uh you told you know you wrote everything out but maybe you could summarize it sure um so liliana was seven months old when we both moved my husband and i moved to asia to become language students and we were very happy there things were going well liliana had been having a lot of you know crying as a young infant right after her inoculations and so i didnt connect any dots we just kept on vaccinating and things like that but when we got to asia things were going fine um but then we noticed directly after her inoculation for the mmr and the typhoid um she started losing weight dramatically she lost over six pounds in two weeks uh and she was very small she was only two and a half years old at that time shes four now um and so uh yeah i was really concerned i took her to the pediatrician and he misdiagnosed her with a virus without doing any testing whatsoever and gave me a um like uh what do you call that a um uh antibiotic and i decided i just felt really weird about that i didnt like the idea of giving her an antibiotic without knowing that it was a virus and shed had lots of viruses in the past but this was different it was just weird like the sudden losing weight the constant thirst i i didnt know the signs of diabetes at all and so i didnt know what to make but i just knew it was not a virus this is weird um but she kept on getting worse and worse and worse we were trying to feed her and she just could not move bowels that was the most horrible thing like to see her in that state where she was in so much pain crying and crying and her belly was just so big and i knew she needed to get that out but she couldnt and so finally i took her to the pediatrician again and he gave me a suppository and im like um it was so horrible just doing that to her and then she she went into seizures because it was so painful and um so she was able to pass a small bowel but still she was just losing all that weight and um so uh the day after that um i i you know i asked myself why now how how did i bring myself to actually go to a language lesson when she was in that condition but i i went to my language lesson i came home um and she did not recognize me she was just sitting on the chair like zoned out like totally glazed over her breath was labored um i started talking to her and she like looked beyond me she wasnt even looking at me it was just the most scary thing and she got up to walk and just collapsed and i just panicked i was like i i dont know the doctor is not helping us with this i dont know what this is so i took a video of her and shot it to um a really good friend of ours who lived like super close praise god he was only like five minutes away they lived in the same neighborhood and so he watched the video immediately he was a nurse um also um american and so he he knew you know when he saw her he knew something was awful so he rushed to our house and did a urine analysis of her diaper keep in mind she wasnt potty trained she wasnt talking like shes a baby but he brought whatever those little sticks are called with him and he stuck that in her diaper and immediately said theres sugar in her diaper she has diabetes and i i didnt even know what type diabetes was you know and he was like lets get in the car weve got to go get you know get her to the er and um my husband was sick that day he had the flu but we we piled into the car and i was like i was so stressed and zoned i it was like my head was just going slow motion i couldnt process anything um so praise god that that guy the nurse our friend was able to drive us to the the um emergency room and the doctors there in this asian country did not know how to take care of diabetes type one so he kind of coached them through you know bringing her blood sugars down giving her a blood sugar test um you know what other tests need to be run like that c peptide and the whole you know gamut of tests i think you said their blood sugars were was yes yes and of course me not knowing anything about diabetes we dont have a history of that in my family i didnt realize that thats lifethreatening i didnt realize that thats called dka i didnt know anything so when they told me that i would you know i was still zoned out i didnt know what was going on so to me you know all you know them sticking her with different things and it was just so traumatic i almost passed out like watching her go through that kind of trauma and shes screaming and you know like i cant even talk about it without i could imagine i could imagine then you what happened is um you probably got the blood sugars under control and the foods the doctors recommending were just all carb and uh youre kind of like whats going on yes yes uh there in the hospital she was hospitalized for days during that time the nurses would come in and give her the shots the the insulin and then give her this bowl of rice with chicken you know and a little bit of you know sugary tea or something and and i you know i i really trusted doctors i trusted people that said they knew how to take care of diseases and so you know we fed it to her and then her her blood sugars would shoot through the roof and this went on for a couple months of course we were discharged we came home we had to move back to the states all that happened and her her endocrinologist here in the states was telling us the same thing give her everything shes already used to eating you know and she was eating normal kid food like the animal crackers and cheerios and sugar bombs and ice cream and cookies and crackers pancakes and syrup and all that good stuff and so we it was i was literally in tears every day like i would check her blood sugars and they would be you know a couple hours after eating or even in the middle of the night you know because it was literally a roller coaster so i became so desperate and stressed out with this pattern i lost my trust in the medical establishment i thought this is not working its just not managing this disease and um so i found your channel and that i can say that was a a um a direct answer to my husband and my prayers um yeah we were begging god daily like give either a cure or a way to manage this thing like to help our child not to have complications because i was reading scary articles i was seeing articles like if its not managed whats going to happen when she gets years old right blindness the neuropathy all that stuff and it scared me sure so yeah so we we started looking i was looking like day and night and searching and i put in cure for diabetes type one in my search and somehow one of your videos popped up it wasnt a cure there is no cure that we know but wow um you were talking about i think you were talking about a cure for type actually the ketone intermittent fasting and so i watched that and i was like well if it can do that for type lets give it a shot and so shes been now in ketosis for over probably close to a year at this point i ive lost track a little bit but shes doing great and youre youre youre even going to the doctor saying what about this ketogenic diet and they probably werent they werent supporting it yeah no they still theyre still kind of skeptical but at first they were telling us oh youre gonna cause seizures youre gonna you know her brain is gonna go downhill her cognitive function is gonna be just zero and all this scary stuff but after i watched and watched and watched every day i was watching your videos and i that gave me the confidence to say to the doctor this is the diet we decided to do and we believe our child is going to be okay we think its going to be good for her and they said okay well just do it you know youll youll talk to us later youll be sorry and all kinds of things but but it you know that never happened shes only improved since starting this diet and even her ac right has come way down yeah its come way down yeah and then her blood sugars whats her blood sugars running um lets see when she gets up in the morning its around maybe to somewhere in there thats thats a lot better than yeah yeah its still hard to manage sometimes because she is a child she cant do it by herself so its me and my husband are doing it for her she does wear a pump and a cgm um you know which is helpful really helpful and shes the the cutest thing ive ever seen shes so cute yeah shes sitting here i told her we were going to talk to you and she was really excited oh ive got ive got your keto shake that she drinks here every day here she is oh dr berg that is so awesome hey that looks familiar ive seen that before yeah so here it is we love it oh wow every day i even put fresh kale in with it and mix it up with a little extra chocolate in there oh thats awesome yeah low low carb of course so um so she she even watches some of the videos and learning some of the organs and she loves your videos she she memorized parts of them wow when you start going into your ad about you know like the the the little ad at the end shes like quoting it with you because you say that same ad after every single video thats so cute oh shes so adorable and uh so shes four and a half right now right yeah and she has shes like what second grade level reading yes yes shes been reading for a year now oh my goodness wow so she i i think i i attribute the cognitive function to the keto and shes not doing intermittent fasting of course shes too little for that but yeah just yeah her brain function went up dramatically absolutely ive been shocked because im not like were not even doing official homeschooling yet this is like four years old wow yeah so amazing yeah because see the key you get that um like even our granddaughter lucy we shes doing keto not intermittent fasting and shes shes developed a very fast rate cognitive skills sharp i mean her moods up i mean its just a normal child right ive heard you talk about her yeah yeah so this is incredible incredible story so um well we have you to thank and of

sirpa success story tommy prostatitis pain,tommy was having baths a day to manage the pain from his prostatitis and became frustrated when his doctors struggled to,anyway welcome tommy and thank you so much for offering to tell us your experiences re your own recovery from working through the online program and i know itd be really helpful to other people and i know people on the online program actually interested to hear as well so theyll be looking forward to watching this video so do you want to tell us a little bit about yourself first of all yeah so basically ive always suffered with ocd obsessive compulsive disorder yep so snd then basically i suppose you know it gradually over they years manifested into tms which are i sort of associate with like the physical version of ocd because of the similarities and stuff ocd definitely and anxiety are all part and parcel just other types of symptoms yeah yeah obviously throughout growing up really ive suffered with all different types of stuff i mean the last few years actually really understood and actually realized that i do have some a condition that flares up from time to time but most of the time im pretty good at you know managing it like i say and i suppose thats why that last one my current like the pelvic pain thats why it hit me so hard because obviously it come out of nowhere and you know made me doubt what i actually knew it was all along you know so basically it sounds like from you took you started going down this approach when the pelvic pain came on and then you started using that and found that it was actually helping with the anxiety presumably and the ocd as well is that right yeah great so how old are you now tommy a young looking okay so you so initially obviously your journey you start suffering from ocd mainly and then it was how long ago when you developed the pelvic pain pelvic pain was september last year so coming up to a year ago now and what diagnosis were you given because i know you had the tests yeah i was originally diagnosed with prostatitis mmhmm which if you actually when you really look into basically prostatitis is basically what they diagnose when they really dont know whats wrong with you yeah is what i pretty much learnt from everyone and you know they cant say how long youre gonna have it how long youre not gonna have it and things like that but then obviously then ill try although i knew originally it was gonna be tms i still even now still had to do and find every other cure before i come back and accepted that i knew that this is what it was right so how long have you known about tms tms another one of them probably about seven or eight years you know andy taylor really well we was a yep one of our practitioners yep originally i had a really bad knee a few years ago id have every test going operations everything nothing workedcouldnt even run up the road and then obviously andy used to treat me and thats when he said spokeabout you and said you know why dont you try this and give this a go and literally with him for two years i was in pain with that and literally within three or four weeks i was running around playing football game pain free fantastic so obviously when it had every time i had little flareups after that i told myself it was tms and fine and you know a week or so and it would go away and stuff again thats why this time when the pelvic pain you know just you know and then you get told there is something wrong with you and you know just spiraled and you have to have anything ruled out anyway but then sadly for you andyretired didnt he and he moved away yes i mean i did actually go up and see him he did come down come down and see me so you know we talked it through and stuff again but the problem is when you suffer with ocd as well you have to find the you have to have the answer there and then you have to find it and keep searching and searching i mean i did everything tried acupuncture chinese herbal medicine injections you name it i did i did the lot and if anything it just basically fed the tms and this made the pain get worse and worse how was it impacting your life at that time basically work wise i literally could go work for about two hours come home have to spend an hour in a bath go back to work for couple of hours come back i was having about five or six baths a day just because of the pain and then obviously like its like the mental side of it you know just from the moment you wake up and youre like am i gonna have pain and were not gonna have pain and again obviously i just became obsessed with it and you know and it didnt help because i was getting married in a december you know and i wasobviously completely useless on the whole of the planning stuff obviously ive got three children as well so you know but i think thats probably one of the main reasons why i managed to be able to get up and go to work because you know never in all the pains ive had ive never experienced pain like that and then obviously when youre googling it and you know everything is going and you know and everyones saying ive had it for years youre never gonna ooph you know yeah crazy yes quite at least coming across this and help realizing or accepting that it was tms or stress induced it helped you realize that there was hope anyway yes light at the end of the tunnel yes definitely so i know we had we had a quick call i gave you one of my free calls to be able to just answer some questions look at whats going on and give you some advice moving forward and you decided at that point to sign up to the online program andwork through that yourself didnt you yeah while you were were doing that from what we talked about while you were doing that did you recognize what was the actual trigger for your pelvic pain at that point i had an idea and a few things that i was doing obviously i am ive got my own business i employ a lot of family members i had to do a lot of restructuring and which i wasnt comfortable because that was gonna affect other people in the family and stuff so i knew that that was one of them then obviously plus the wedding coming up and stuff it just all and i knew something i linked it as well because im very good at when my ocd starts getting a bit worse i know that you know theres pressure building and stuff im quite good at reading that into it but again this time it just didnt click until obviously a big bang and next thing i know im up london every week getting different diagnoses to making sure that i havent got any any diseases and stuff i just you know mad at least you did rule it out so when you started the program you were sure that this was stress induced oh definitely obviously ive read like every sarno obviously got every your book sarnos books on audio and like literally every night i was listening to the books over and over again and working through the worksheet and it can be quite hard getting an understanding obviously this is an educational and self empowering approach but just doing the same old same old is not always the answer is it no reading all the books but for many people thats what they do and they get better but if they dont then its important to recognize that actually that means that they probably need some more support or they need to do something differently and i know thats why you decided youve read all the books and you felt that you needed a bit more structured approach to recovery is that right oh yeah no no definitely i mean like i say again weve made certain things become ritual so before when ive hadpains its read the book a couple days or a week or so yeah youre fine and then obviously this week so you know obviously hes going so obviously with the help of those to its like know something ive got to make some sort of change in what im doing in my everyday life its you know it made me realize that you know something im doing my body or my brain it doesnt like so you know its now do something about it and were gonna keep reminding you that you know you need to do something about it yeah absolutely how would you explain that the online program helped then for example what were the main benefits you got from that again for me i like structure im going for all the points whether thats the right way to do or not but for me it was ive benefited from the structure of you know where im going to go through this section today im gonna go through that section and in going over it and over it and over it again till it was like set in my mind but yeah sorry and doing the worksheets presumably yes finding out gaining the insights and doing those working with them yes yes i mean i probably did the same the same question youre going through the same questions on the worksheet probably about five or six times over and over again so i would accept thats whative put down and stuff best advice i could give is just dont deviate the way if youre gonna believe if youre going to go with tms and you can accept that thats what it dont matter what anyone tells you that you know just keep going absolutely and it sounds like you did really well with that just reached that point of acceptance yeah i mean it took ive got to be honest it took it took a while and its this depression that goes with it that just knocks you you know because at the end of the day that i would do right im gonna do this and thats gonna work i mean im gonna be cured right then obviously as soon as it doesnt work straight away thats when the doubts come in thats when you think very common yeah you know and its just just everyone says like the worst thing you can do is try and put a timeframe on it you know right im going to be better within a set amount of time because theyre just you know its just i guess its different absolutely i was about to say that each journey its an individual one for each individual person and it it is about not putting pressure on yourself and allowing yourself to recover and working on the underlying causes and actually that the symptom is less important than actually addressing the underlying causes so the process is the same yes obviously can be slightly different with each individual but the process is the same and its about not just focusing on the fact well i havent got that symptom or and maybe thats not the same for me but having said that thats why i asked you if you would be happy to do this video because i work with so many people who have pelvic pain both men and women with various different diagnoses but because this they tend to be a bit embarrassed about it yeah theyre less likely to want to actually do a video recovery or write any recovery publicly which i think is sad because its probably one of the biggest conditions thats ive been working with this year theres no doubt about it its on the increase i mean i mean if this helps one person then ill think thats a success because obviously when i was looking it up and everything and you know ive broken bones before ive had back pain ive had but ive never experienced anything like it and obviously when you look it up i mean you can find a million horror stories and find that one that one proper one that you believe in where people saying youre gonna be fine dont worry you know hardly anything out there its amazing when you try and get in you know when i was seeing the specialist i said to him when youve got prostatitis i said so what is that then and he couldnt give me a straight answer and he knew once i obviously went through all the testings and everything that he did he said yep no hes its all cleared up theres nothing wrong with you know right now i nowneed to refer you to a pain specialist cause youve got chronic pain and i said well how do i get rid of that then he said i cant tell you go back see someone referred to someone else then they turn round and say youve got nerve damage okay what does that mean cant tell you well is there is there a fix for it and literally and these are the top specialists i mean i was quite fortunate that obviously i have like private medical dont want to see some of the top specialists could not give me an answer of why it happens or there basically is still in the dark with it so you know normally if you go with back pain they can go oh this discs out of line which could be the pain couldnt be the pain with pelvic pain they cant actually tell you what is causing the pain and because it obviously affects so many different areas so they cant even narrow it down to where the actual pain the only thing i like which looking up that ive got is basically obviously the brain telling you something and then the nerves and stuff you basically scramble your brain and you know in your brain picks up on it says right that is real were gonna keep with that and then obviously which is basically the tms and its just a case of retraining your brain that no thats no need for that pain so what are the things that your take away because youll youll have seen from this this is not a get rid of the pain approach this is a program this is a personal development program isnt it and i certainly follow it now more for maintaining my health and wellbeing and dealing with whatever is happening in my life but what are the big take homes for you what are they how has it changed your life now as far as how you look after yourself for example oh well literally every morning and night obviously i even do like yoga mindfulness just like at the end of every day so i i do minutes just reflecting on the day and you know calming basically calming the body down calming your thoughts down and stuff and you know and yeah just basically not letting life take over and anything if i think oh that could have been a bit stressful today id sort of talked through it or ill journal or journal down about your know that you know or that was quite a stressful day so rather than not thinking about it let it build on a daily basis now anything i thought might have been a bit stressful thing im literally writing down about it you know saying for instance if i had a particular bad experience at work or whatever id come home and make sure that i wrote that and how i felt about that experience rather than not doing anything and you know then the next one happens dont do nothing about the next one then all of a sudden yeah yeah its just been really mindful i mean i know that is a lot of people say thats the fad thing out at the moment i just think its not that its a fad i just think that is coming more to light now that we have to look after ourselves like mentally as well as physically absolutely and presumably each time there is an issue youre acknowledging it but youre looking at maybe how you could do it better the next time or looking at the positives that might come out yeah yeah yeah you definitely have to like because i mean also since this happened and obviously some of the forums and posts that i do as well is all about it i mean im ive talked quite a lot of people now about tms and stuff and you know how it can happen i mean theres still so many people that think im cuckoo when you talk about tms you know because like you can literally relate anything to but you know yeah i just think if you believe which theres no reason not to obviously the evidence and especially like i say when especially when youve got specialiststelling you they dont know theres a clue i know if they cant tell you then obviously then you think wellactually it is more of a mental mental thing so like i say im just living day by day i met with people that loads of people message me about stuff now and you know and see if i can give back great yes absolutely and thats wonderful its always wonderful when we have people who have gone through it themselves because youre the ones that people will believe as well when you are able to share tips and suggestions and advice about how youve done it as well so being able to do video recovery stories like this that we can reach more people as well is fantastic so thank you very much for agreeing to do this ya know no worries but like i say i think what ill regret now is obviously we had the initial talk on the phone i did wait too long to do it where is i i think if someone is believing in the tms approach i do believe straight on with a program straight away because i could ive learned such a good job of managing it i obviously the ocd and stuff like that i didnt want to accept that you know this had come again because you know like i say i saw when it happened years ago i said to myself now id never let myself get in a state like that again obviously i missed the warning signs and in the end its like youre ignoring us youre ignoring us so listen to mebut lesson learned and now i bet you really do notice any warning signs because we all then its normal to have physical systems that are messages from within its just a mindbody relationship so ive no doubt that you i and everybody else will still get the odd symptoms the odd signal but its dealing with the signals before they actually then go on and cause a problem mentallyfantastic thank you tommy,1.0
one of the greatest speeches ever steve jobs,steve jobs the exclusive biography steve jobs delivers an inspirational speech listen to the end for,today i want to tell you three stories from my life thats it no big deal just three stories music the first story is about connecting the dots i dropped out of reed college after the first six months but then stayed around as a dropin for another months or so before i really quit so whyd i drop out it started before i was born my biological mother was a young unwed graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that i should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when i popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who were on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking weve got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school she refused to sign the final adoption papers that a few months later when my parents promised that i would go to college this was the start in my life and years later i did go to college but i naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as stanford and all of my workingclass parent savings were being spent on my college tuition after six months i couldnt see the value in it i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out and here i was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life so i decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions i ever made the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the required classes that didnt interest me and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting it wasnt all romantic i didnt have a dorm room so i slept on the floor in friends rooms i returned coke bottles for the five cent deposits to buy food with and i would walk the seven miles across town every sunday night to get one good meal a week at the hari krishna temple i loved it and much of what i stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on let me give you one example read college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country throughout the campus every poster every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed because i had dropped out and didnt have to take the normal classes i decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this i learned about serif and sans serif typefaces about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations about what makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically subtle in a way that science cant capture and i found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life ten years later when we were designing the first macintosh computer it all came back to me and we designed it all into the mac it was the first computer with beautiful typography if i had never dropped in on that single course in college the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts and since windows just copied the mac its likely that no personal computer would have them if i had never dropped out i would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when i was in college but it was very very clear looking backwards years later again you cant connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the wellworn path and that will make all the difference music my second story is about love and loss i was lucky i found what i love to do early in life was and i started apple in my parents garage when i was we worked hard and in years apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a two billion dollar company with over four thousand employees we just released our finest creation the macintosh a year earlier and i just turned and then i got fired how can you get fired from a company you started well as apple grew we hired someone who i thought was very talented to run the company with me and for the first year or so things went well but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we did our board of directors sided with him and so at i was out and very publicly out what had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating i really didnt know what to do for a few months i felt that id let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that i had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me i met with david packard and bob noyes and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly i was a very public failure and i even thought about running away from the valley but something slowly began to dawn on me i still loved what i did the turn of events at apple had not changed that one bit id been rejected but i was still in love and so i decided to start over i didnt see it then it turned out that getting fired from apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again less sure about everything freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life during the next five years i started a company named next another company named pixar and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film toy story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events apple bought next and i returned to apple and the technology we developed it next is at the heart of apples current renaissance and lorraine and i have a wonderful family together im pretty sure none of this would have happened if i hadnt been fired from apple it was awful tasting medicine but i guess the patient needed it sometime life sometimes lifes going to hit you in the head with a brick dont lose faith im convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that i loved what i did youve got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking and dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it and like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking dont settle my third story is about death when i was i read a quote that went something like if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past years ive looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself if today were the last day of my life what i want to do what i am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row i know i need to change something remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life because almost everything all external expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure these things just fall away in the face of death leaving only what is truly important remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart no one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven dont want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life its lifes change agent it clears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be cleared away sorry to be so dramatic but its quite true your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drowned out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary stay hungry stay foolish,1.0

college,number one put god first put god first in everything you do everything that you think you see in me everything that ive accomplished everything that you think i have and i have a few things everything that i have is by the grace of god understand that its a gift years ago march was years ago just this past march i was flunking out of college i had a grade point average i hope none of you can relate i had grade point average i was sitting in my mothers beauty shop they still call it beauty shops now what they call it yeah ill sit in the beauty parlor i was sitting in my mothers beauty parlor and im looking in the mirror and i see behind me this woman under the dryer and every time she looked up every time i looked up she was looking at me just looking at me in the eye i dont know who she was and i said you know she said somebody give me a pen give me a pencil i have a prophecy march she said boy you are gonna travel the world and speak to millions of people now mind you i flunked out of college im thinking about joining the army i didnt know what i was gonna do shes telling me im gonna travel the world and speak to millions of people well i have traveled the world and

since ive been protected ive been directed ive been corrected i kept god in my life and has kept me humble i didnt always stick with him but he always stuck with me so stick with him in everything you do if you think you want to do what you think ive done then do what ive done and stick with god number two fail big thats right fail big today is the beginning of the rest of your life and it can be be very frightening its a new world out there its a mean world out there and you only live once so do what you feel passionate about take chances professionally dont be afraid to fail theres an old iq test was nine dots and you had to draw five lines with a pencil within these nine dots without lifting the pencil the only way to do it was to go outside the box so dont be afraid to go outside the box dont be afraid to think outside the box dont be afraid to fail big to dream big but remember dreams without goals are just dreams and they ultimately fuel disappointment so have dreams but have goals life goals yearly goals monthly goals daily goals i try to give myself a goal every day sometimes just did not curse somebody out simple goals but have goals and understand that to achieve these goals you must apply discipline and consistency in order to achieve your goals you must apply discipline which youve already done and consistency every day not just on tuesday and miss a few days you have to work at it every day you have to plan every day youve heard the saying we dont plan to fail we fail to plan hard work works working really hard is what successful people do and in this text

getting a lot more done dont confuse movement with progress my mother told me you can run in place all the time and never get anywhere so continue to strive continue to have goals continue to progress number three youll never see a uhaul behind a hearse ill say it again youll never see a uhaul behind a hearse i dont care how much money you make you cant take it with you and its not how much you have its what you do with what you have we all have different talents some of you will be doctors some lawyers some scientists some educators some nurses some teachers yeah okay some preachers the most selfish thing you can do in this world is help someone else why is it selfish because the gratification the goodness that comes to you the good feeling the good feeling that i get from helping others nothings better than that not jewelry not big house i have not the cars but its the joy thats where the joy is in helping others thats where the success is finally i pray that you put your slippers way under the bed tonight so that when you wake up in the morning you have to get on your knees to reach them and while youre down there say thank you for grace thank you for mercy thank you for understanding thank you for wisdom thank you for parents thank you for love thank you for kindness thank you for humility thank you for peace thank you for prosperity say thank you in advance for

give it to god stop worrying amp trust god inspirational amp motivational video,when we give our burdens worries and cares to god it will bring us peace trust and believe that god is for you he loves you,lets start in matthew jesus is speaking said i tell you do not worry about your life what youll eat or drink or about your body what youll wear who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life and why do you worry about clothes oh you have little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own and then in philippians do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus jesus said very plainly very repetitively do not worry im of the opinion that if jesus says not to do something he has our best interests at heart hes not being meddlesome hes not trying to limit us hes concerned about our wellbeing and weve missed something something has eluded us we have tolerated something in our lives in our thoughts in our emotions weve tolerated something allowed it to flourish that in reality is destructive that jesus has said dont do that that we are so twisted and tied up and and melting down in our own worries and problems and we forget that we have a heavenly father right there saying do you want my help and we just got to say i want your help and trust that he can do what he needs to do let him do the work that needs to be done look if youre counting on yourself to solve all of your problems then of course youre worried and stressed out it doesnt matter how strong or wise or capable how charismatic you are it doesnt matter how much wealth or influence you have you are not designed to be able to take on everything and handle everything you will have more problems come at you than what you are capable of handling when you carry the responsibility of everything then you have to do everything you have to find the solutions you have to choose the right direction you have to power through problems you have to plan for the future make adjustments and you have to do all of it at the speed of life yeah youre stressed out youre worried of course but god does not want you to do it on your own he wants you to recognize that he is there to lead you to walk you through to guide you through every step of the way and heres the deal he doesnt want to just give you every resource that you need to get through your problems he wants to be what you need in every situation its amazing the problems that are solved the moment that you decide to trust god in everything because when you trust god you dont have to try to figure anything out anymore as you lean on him then you take the pressure off of yourself because you dont have to try to figure stuff out you dont have to try to change things that youve already tried a million times to change and the more you try to change the more frustrated it makes you because you can just finally say well god im trusting you with this and if you cant change it then i guess they dont need to be changed the only way you can learn to stop worrying and stop trying to figure things out stop being jealous of what other people have is i just honestly think that in addition to studying the word i think that we just have to try it our way long enough to finally just get worn out enough to just say okay god i surrender you know that beginning you know the end and everything in between you know every flaw that i have every fault that i have you know every weakness that i have as well as my strengths i surrender so many times i have just said god i dont know what to do god im overwhelmed or god im in over my head and you know ive said this many times god help please it doesnt have to be long it doesnt have to be eloquent i dont have to have the answers or the solutions i just need to go to the one who does have the answers have you ever been on an emotional roller coaster i mean youre just up youre down youre this way and you know what god says ill take care of that you ever go to bed thinking about it wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it in the morning you get up youre thinking about it man it has captured your thinking god says ill take your emotion and your thinking through christ jesus first peter says cast all your cares on him because he cares for you and what that means is that we take all of our problems and our worries and we choose to place it in gods hands and say i trust that you will handle the outcome are you confident that you can take your problems and your worries and place it in gods hands and that he can handle everything worry is the anticipation of the negative in fact theres a relationship between faith and worry its inverse faith diminishes as worry flourishes or as your faith flourishes your worry will diminish worry is the negative expression of what faith in god is one of them would be i dont want jesus to ever look at me and use my name and person of little faith in the same sentence do you i want to be a man of faith worry are you saying i dont think god can handle this so im gonna pick it up and im going to invest emotional energy and my thoughts and my anxiety im not gonna change the outcome a bit jesus said you cant add one hour to your life god can add years god has the best solution for all of our problems he sees and knows everything he sees the future he understands every angle of what is going on in your life right now he understands how people are viewing it and perceiving it he sees the best solution to your problems hes incredibly wise when i worry i am basically saying i am afraid that my life is not going to be that i would the way that i want it to but when i trust that god has the best solution i am saying god i believe that you have the best way for me even if its not the path that i chose or that i came up with and we can trust that if we follow god and if we trust him he will give us every resource that we need every step of the way and that at the end he can turn that into something wonderful and beautiful and let me tell you if you have someone who loves you enough and who is strong enough and who has the best solution what do you have to worry about see the reason that worry exists so often is because we just think its normal its not normal its common but its not normal it doesnt have to be in our life and its robbing us of god its robbing us of our family it distracts me from god in people it robs me of my joy and it exists because i allow it to exist listen to what im saying worry exists and anxiety exist because we allow it we are in complete control of our lives god would never command us to do something that we dont have the ability to do worry is a choice and trust is a choice you cant do both at the same time you have to choose to put your trust in god put the full weight of your problems and your life and your future into his hands and let him carry it worry and anxiety means the devil has implanted something in your life thats just sitting there intimidating you and because of that you cant focus on god in the people that you love and thats the greatest problem with worrying anxiety it robs you of your ability to worship to love the people that you love so its an enemy the root of all fear worry and anxiety is an orphan spirit because orphans are on their own and they have to take care of their own problems and the devil wants you to feel as though that youre on your own and you have to solve your own problems you have the best father in the universe stop grieving over the father you didnt have and start rejoicing that you have the best father in the universe and he loves helping you process anything in your life nothing is too small nothing is too large he just enjoys the ride he just enjoys the relationship and as were sitting here obsessing about something what it means is were wasting the relationship he does see your problems and he wants to help you gods love for you is so immense and that means that you can come to him with anything and everything we dont have to lead lives that are defined by worry and anxiety and fear doesnt mean those things wont come and they may even come with justification but jesus said we dont have to worry about that he is my provider he is my protector he is my promoter he is the person that i longed for in every relationship he is the place that i look to to find home he is my professor to reveal beautiful new things to me he is everything that i need and everything that i longed for when i go to him the key to peace is not being able to solve every problem the key to peace is resting in who god is when we give god control theres a beautiful promise that he will never leave or forsake you man we can walk in that path in that promise towards peace he doesnt want you to be overwhelmed with worry and problems he wants you to be overwhelmed with his love for you and you may be saying look you dont understand how many problems i have how many issues and how much ive gone through well you know what god says no matter what you have i want to take all of your problems all of your worries all of your failures all of your sin all of your brokenness give it to me because i can handle it and the truth is only i can handle it,1.0
admiral mcraven leaves the audience speechless one of the best motivational speeches,us navy admiral william h mcraven one of the most decorated us commanders delivers one of the best motivational,what starts here changes the world i have a few suggestions that may help you on your way to a better world and while these lessons were learned during my time in the military i can assure you that it matters not whether you ever served a day in uniform it matters not your gender your ethnic or religious background your orientation or your social status our struggles in this world are similar and the lessons to overcome those struggles and to move forward changing ourselves and changing the world around us will apply equally to all so here are the ten lessons i learned from basic seal training that hopefully will be of value to you as you move forward in life every morning in seal training my instructors who at the time were all vietnam veterans would show up in my barracks room and the first thing theyd do is inspect my bed if you did it right the corners would be square the covers would be pulled tight the pillows centered just under the headboard and the extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of the rack it was a simple task mundane at best but every morning we were required to make our bed to perfection it seemed a little ridiculous at the time particularly light of the fact that we were aspiring to be real warriors tough battlehardened seals but the wisdom of this simple act has been proven to me many times over if you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourage you to do another task and another and another and by the end of the day that one task completed will have turned into many task completed making your bed will also reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter if you cant do the little things right youll never be able to do the big things right and if by chance you have a miserable day you will come home to a bed that is made that you made and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better so if you want to change the world start off by making your bed music during seal training the students during training the students are all broken down into boat crews each crew is seven students three on each side of a small rubber boat and one coxon to help guide the dinghy every day your boat crew forms up on the beach and is instructed to get through the surf zone and paddle several miles down the coast in the winter the surf off san diego can get to be eight to ten feet high and it is exceedingly difficult the paddle hook through the plunging surf unless everyone digs in every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke count of the coxon everyone must exert equal effort or the boat will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously dumped back on the beach for the boat to make it to its destination everyone must paddle you cant change the world alone you will need some help and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends colleagues the good will of strangers and a strong coxen to guide you if you want to change the world find someone to help you paddle over a few weeks of difficult training my seal class which started with men was down to just there were now six boat crews of seven men each i was in the boat with the tall guys but the best boat crew we had was made up of little guys the munchkin crew we called them no one was over five foot five the munchkin boat crew had one americanindian one africanamerican one polish american one greek american one italian american and two tough kids from the midwest they out paddled out ran and out swam all the other boat crews the big men and the other boat crews will always make goodnatured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little feet prior to every swim but somehow these little guys from every corner of the nation in the world always had the last laugh swimming faster than everyone and reaching the shore long before the rest of us seal training was a great equalizer nothing mattered but your will to succeed not your color not your ethnic background not your education not your social status if you want to change the world measure a person by the size of their heart not by the size of their flippers several times a week the instructors would line up the class and do a uniform inspection it was exceptionally thorough your hat had to be perfectly starched your uniform immaculately pressed your belt buckle shiny and void of any smudges but it seemed that no matter how much effort you put into starching your hat or pressing your uniform or polishing your belt buckle it just wasnt good enough the instructors would find something wrong for failing the uniform inspection the student had to run fully clothed into the surf zone then wet from head to toe roll around on the beach until every part of your body was covered with sand the effect was known as sugarcookie you stayed in the uniform the rest of the day cold wet and sandy there were many a student who just couldnt accept the fact that all their efforts were in vain that no matter how hard they tried to get the uniform right it went unappreciated those students didnt make it through training those students didnt understand the purpose of the drill you were never going to succeed you were never going to have a perfect uniform the instructors werent going to allow it sometimes no matter how well you prepare or how well you perform you still end up as a sugar cookie its just the way life is sometimes if you want to change the world get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward every day during training you were challenged with multiple physical events long runs long swims obstacle courses hours of calisthenics something designed to test your mettle every event had standards times you had to meet if you fail to meet those times those standards your name was posted on a list and at the end of the day those on the list were invited to a circus a circus was two hours of additional calisthenics designed to wear you down to break your spirit to force you to quit no one wanted a circus a circus meant that for that day you didnt measure up a circus meant more fatigue and more fatigue meant that the following day would be more difficult and more circuses were likely but at some time during seal training everyone everyone made the circus list but an interesting thing happened to those who were constantly on the list over time those students who did two hours of extra calisthenics got stronger and stronger the pain of the circuses built inner strength and physical resiliency life is filled with circuses you will fail you will likely fail often it will be painful it will be discouraging at times it will test you to your very core but if you want to change the world dont be afraid of the circuses at least twice a week the trainees were required to run the obstacle course the obstacle course contained obstacles including the foot wall a foot cargo net a barbed wire crawl to name a few but the most challenging obstacle was the slide for life it had a three level foot tower at one end and a one level tower at the other in between was a foot long rope you had to climb the three tiered tower and once at the top you grabbed the rope swung underneath the rope and pulled yourself hand over hand until you got to the other end the record for the obstacle course had stood for years when my class began in the record seemed unbeatable until one day a student decided to go down the slide for life headfirst instead of swinging his body underneath the rope and inching his way down he bravely mounted the top of the rope and thrust himself forward it was a dangerous move seemingly foolish and fraught with risk failure could be an injury and being dropped from the course without hesitation the students slid down the rope perilously fast instead of several minutes it only took him half that time and by the end of the course he had broken the record if you want to change the world sometimes you have to slide down the obstacles headfirst during the land warfare phase of training the students are flown out to san clemente island which lies off the coast of san diego the waters off san clemente are a breeding ground for the great white sharks to pass seal training theyre a series of long swims that must be completed one is the night swim before the swim the instructors joyfully brief the students on all the species of sharks that inhabit the waters off san clemente they assure you however that no student has ever been eaten by a shark at least not that they can remember but you are also taught that if a shark begins to circle your position stand your ground do not swim away do not act afraid and if the shark hungry for a midnight snack darts towards you then summons up all your strength and punch him in the snout and he will turn and swim away there are a lot of sharks in the world if you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them so if you want to change the world dont back down from the sharpest as navy seals one of our jobs is to conduct underwater attacks against the enemys shipping we practice this technique extensively during training the ship attack mission is where a pair of seal divers is dropped off outside an enemy harbor and then swims well over two miles underwater using nothing but a depth gauge and a compass to get to the target during the entire swim even well below the surface there is some light that comes through it is comforting to know that there is open water above you but as you approach the ship which is tied to appear the light begins to fade the steel structure of the ship blocks the moonlight it blocks the surrounding streetlamps it blocks all ambient light to be successful in your mission you have to swim under the ship and find the keel the centerline and the deepest part of the ship this is your objective but the keel is also the darkest part of the show where you cannot see your hand in front of your face where the noise from the ships machinery is deafening and where it gets to be easily disoriented and you can fail every seal knows that under the keel at that darkest moment of the mission is a time when you need to be calm when you must be called when you must be composed when all your tactical skills your physical power and your inner strength must be brought to bear if you want to change the world you must be your very best in the darkest moments the ninth week of training is referred to as hell week it is six days of no sleep constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the mud flats the mud flats are an area between san diego and tijuana where the rough water runs off and creates the tijuana sloughs a swampy patch of terrain where the mud will engulf you it is on wednesday of hell week that you paddle down in the mud flats and spend the next hours trying to survive this freezing cold the howling wind and the incessant pressure to quit from the instructors as the sun began to set that wednesday evening my training class having committed some egregious infraction of the rules was ordered into the mud the mud consumed each man till there was nothing visible but our heads the instructors told us we could leave the mud if only five men would quit only five minutes just five men and we could get out of the oppressive cold looking around the mud flat it was apparent that some students were about to give up it was still over eight hours till the sun came up eight more hours of bonechilling cold a chattering teeth and the shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything and then one voice began to echo through the night one voice raised in song the song was terribly out of tune but sung with great enthusiasm one voice became two and two became three and before long everyone in the class was singing the instructors threatened us with more time in the mud if we kept up the singing but the singing persisted and somehow the mud seemed a little warmer and the wind a little tamer and the dawn not so far away if i have learned anything in my time traveling the world it is the power of the power of one person the washington a lincoln king mandela and even a young girl from pakistan malala one person can change the world by giving people hope so if you want to change the world start singing when youre up to your neck in mud finally a seal training theres a bell a brass bell that hangs in the center of the compound for all the students to see all you have to do quit all you have to do to quit is ring the bell ring the bell and you no longer have to wake up at oclock ring the bell and you no longer have to be in the freezing cold swims ring the bell and you no longer have to do the runs the obstacle course the pt and you no longer have to endure the hardships of training all you have to do is ring the bell to get out if you want to change the world dont ever ever ring the bell it will not be easy start each day with a task completed find someone to help you through life respect everyone know the life is not fair that you will fail often but if you take some risks step up on the time through the toughest face down the bullies lift up the downtrodden and never ever give up if you do these things the next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today and what started here will indeed have changed the world for the better thank you very much,1.0
trust that god is in control hour powerful christian motivation inspirational amp motivational,keep trusting god he is always in control even when your circumstances may seem out of control so when you are feeling,when you look for the word first in the bible you find this teaching you go first to god with your problems we dont take our problems first to the bar we dont numb our fears with narcotics we dont deny the existence of our struggles no we take our problems first to christ he said seek first the kingdom and his righteousness and look all these things will be given to you as well would you like some advice to take into this year that will save you from a month of heartaches go first to god with your problems the moment a problem surfaces is the moment you take that problem to god dont take it out on your friends dont take it out on your family dont try to solve it yourself you take that problem first to god seek first the kingdom and see if all these things arent given to you as well take it to him first you see when gods people put god first blessings begin to flow i want to challenge you to let this be the year you put god first keep first things first he promises and then everything else will fall into place actively seek gods direction in other words gods strategies are better than ours the prophet isaiah said his ways are higher than my ways his thoughts are higher than my thoughts gods strategies are always better so ive got to seek him ive got to ask him for direction and how do i do that i do that through prayer why because we dont want our plans to prevail we want gods plans to prevail we want gods wisdom in our life thats why we seek him thats why i get up in the morning and pray and talk to god what i need gods direction i cant live life on my own impulses my own strategies my own gut instinct no i need the spirit of god giving me wisdom and thats something that can only come to pass through prayer but heres what ive noticed many of us in the body of christ churches and christians we go to god with an already made up mind like we know what were going to do and then were just asking god to bless it but gods saying i wasnt in it to begin with and youre asking me to bless something that i didnt ordain in your life i didnt want you to make that choice you made that choice and i believe god wants to help you no matter what the situation is but gods not here just to give to you he wants to guide you not just give you things he wants to guide you in psalm it says i will guide you along the best pathway for your life how many of you are thankful that god has a best pathway for your life but we have to seek his direction well josh i dont know i dont know how this all gonna work out why dont you just read proverbs chapter three verse five and six it says trust god from the bottom of your heart and dont try to figure out everything on your own listen for gods voice in everything you do and everywhere you go hes the one who will keep you on track god will keep you on track dont plan first and then when youre out in the middle of doing what you want to do pray for god to make it work now first we pray about everything acknowledging god in all of our ways and he will direct our path but there are times in our lives where our actions arent necessarily in obedience to what gods told us to do why because we want to do something else or what gods asking us to do doesnt feel good or what gods asking us to do doesnt align with our plans our actions are inconsistent with what we say that we believe so what do we have to do we got to get the right habits habits are powerful they create our future the habits that we live with and our actions that we do every day create the future that were going to experience today i would dare say that many of us are sitting in the middle of a life that weve created by our own habits by our own actions and when were experiencing difficulty in life and when were tired of it its then we got to say you know what i cant keep doing this thing anymore its bringing pain into my life and its not working out so what habits does god want to help you drop this year what habits does he want to help to establish on the inside of you you see for some of you i believe that god wants to help you establish a habit of prayer a habit of prayer in your life where you start seeking god in the morning in a fresh way you start knowing gods will for your life some of you he just wants you to be faithful to come to his house more make church a priority in your life and i know the kids sports are important i know that things come up and im not saying that all that stuff is bad but if you dont make parents if you dont make church a priority in your kids life dont to be surprised that when they move out of the house its not a priority to them it takes faithful consistency in our actions to get breakthrough i believe breakthrough people do consistently what other people just do occasionally most christians i know who grow cold in their faith or who who grow unproductive or unfruitful or unhappy in their lives do not do so out of a moment of rebellion but do so as a result of minute by minute or day by day just drifting off course the book of hebrews the writer of the book of hebrews says we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard lest we drift away from it let the discipline of the first fruits recalibrate you every day every week so you can stay focused and you can stay on target now one of the saddest scriptures in the bible is jeremiah says my people have forgotten me days without number but i love the net translation of jeremiah does a young woman forget to put on her jewels have you ever forgot your cell phone and went back home to get it says will a bride forget to put on her wedding dress but my people have forgotten me for more days than can even be counted well go back home if we forget our cell phone but has anybody here ever forgotten to pray and thought oh im going back home to pray before i start this day im suggesting that you no longer try to work god into your schedule but you work your schedule around god he would like to guide you and lead you through life and literally let me say it again be involved in everything you do in every decision you make god wants to be part of it be patient be patient and wait dont give up dont give in james one says consider it a sheer gift when tests and challenges come at you from all sides you know that under pressure your faith life is forced out into the open and it shows its true colors in other words you really in it or not it says dont try to get out of anything prematurely let it do it its work so you become mature and well developed not deficient in any way one translation says that youll not lack anything if i dont give up on god then i know on the other side of my faithful obedience and patience then im going to be im going to be stronger than ive ever been im going to be more mature than ive ever been my marriage is going to be better than its ever been im going to not be lacking anything that i need in my life if i dont throw in the towel and give up when times get hard im going to trust god and gods going to bring a breakthrough you know how youre going to get through the attack youre facing friends you know how youre going to get through the trials and the tribulation that you feel like youre facing today youre only going to be able to get through it with gods help many years ago god finally got this through to me and he simply said this you cannot do this and by this he meant life ministry whatever your this is were talking about youre this rather youre this is raising four kids whether youre this as being a single parent you cannot do this unless you put god first in your life that means i cant do without him how do you keep going when times are tough its because you believe that your breakthroughs right around the corner my breakthrough is on the way i may not have it yet but im closer today than i was yesterday quit tying gods hands and take the limits off of him your situation is not too big for god what youre dealing with its not like god havent seen it before hes done it before he can do it again theres no sickness that god having healed theres not a soul that he cant deliver theres not a marriage he cant put back together but you got to trust him and take the limits off of him limits are something that bound or restrain or confine something or someone who cannot do something or have reached their limits but i want to tell you that there is no limit in god hes able to do whatever you need him to do he knows that whatever your problem is he knows the solution to your problem the bible says ephesians and now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh in us you know there is no limit in god hes able to do whatever we need him to do and know this theres nothing too hard for god but when you take the limit off of god you will see miracles take place if you trust him take the limits off of him expect the great awesome things will happen in your life god dont give you what you want he gives you what you believe see the howto is none of your business you keep getting in the way of the blessing cause you all up in the howto part of it show me the scripture where he tells you to figure out how to do anything he dont ask you to how to nothing you just need the word you need to know what its saying applied to you you know why because its a promise of his he never lied he always come through psalm verse he says yes they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel they limited the holy one of israel now how is it possible that we can limit god isnt god limitless isnt god bigger than than we ever could think or imagine doesnt he want to do exceeding abundantly above all above and beyond all that we can ask or think anybody got an answer to that absolutely hes bigger than all that but yet they limited him but we do put limits on god sometimes in our mind we have a version of what god is capable of we have a version of what god is like we have a version of what jesus is like we got to get rid of a small god we gotta let go of a small jesus we gotta stop worshiping a small savior he is the conquering king he is the king of kings and the lord of lords he is bigger than you ever imagined he is greater than you ever imagined god is able to do so many things but we limit him we limit him because of what we hear other people say we limit him because of a human natural experience we limit the holy one of israel god is unlimited amen in matthew chapter jesus came into the house the blind man came to him and jesus said to them do you believe that im able to do this do you believe that im able to do this do you believe no i didnt say do you believe you can see but do you believe jesus said do you believe that i am able to do this our faith is not in our faith our faith is in him it is not your faith it is who you have your faith in a lot of times people are limiting their own lives in what they say about themselves being down on yourself feeling like youre not good enough like youre less than and this voice can come to us in a lot of different ways the world is going to tell you what you cant do satan is going to tell you what you cant do you dont also need to be in agreement with those voices instead you need to agree with what god says about you if god approves you then approve yourself if god chose you then choose yourself if god believes in you then you should believe in yourself we got to learn to stop the negative voices and start to recognize im still a work in progress so often we look at the mess and we dont look at the progress david had a different kind of voice he said this in psalms chapter and verse because of god i can run through a troop because of my helper the lord i can leap over a wall you see because of god i can do you see that we need to take on that same uh that same kind of phrasing in our life that same kind of belief system because of god i can not i cant ill never be enough im not smart enough i got rejected i had a bad start pastor no david didnt do that david said because of god i can you know people are going to say stuff about you to try and limit you but dont limit yourself youve got enough against you for you to be against yourself if god is for you then why would you want to be against yourself take off the limits of what other people try and put on you they said you cant do it but that doesnt mean that you cant do it they didnt create you see god will take the unique things about you and use them to promote you and elevate sometimes the same thing you dont like about yourself is the same thing god wants to use to show you greatness and promotion whats our job to stop being mad about ourselves and putting ourselves down stop being so hard on ourselves quit telling yourself all the reasons you cant accomplish your dreams what you dont have what you didnt get its not going to happen just by your ability your talent your connections its going to happen by the spirit of the living god hes breathing on your life right now his favor is surrounding you in a greater way there are breakthroughs already enroute healing promotions contracts the right people theyre already headed your way now dont talk yourself out of it receive the blessing now take the limits off of god and take the limits off of yourself most people have kind of a fatalistic theology that things just happen and its fatalistic and it theres nothing you can do about it and that is absolutely untrue god has a perfect plan for every persons life in here and god has good thoughts for you his plans for your life are awesome he never made a piece of junk he never made a dud he never made an average person every one of us have something special that god wants to accomplish but most people are ignorant of this and they have bought into the lie of this world that theres nothing special about them every one of you are special every one of you are unique every one of you can do something that nobody else can do god has a purpose for your life and most people are limiting what god can do because they just arent challenging themselves god made you for something great god has taken ordinary people what the world calls ordinary people and time after time after time after time after time has just transformed their life and then use them to touch other people and change things but when you put god first i guarantee you he will transform your life while i wait god works this is not a a nice little christian sentiment to get you through a hard season this is anchored in the unchanging word of god he promises us if you wait on me ill work for you if you wait on me if youre patient if you have expectation if you dont give up if you dont cash out if you just keep following me i promise you you may not see what im doing you may even be tempted to think im not doing anything at all but all the while im orchestrating things for my glory and for your good god works while we wait even when i dont see it and even when i dont feel it youre working so grab hold of that and cling to that truth it doesnt mean your circumstances change in a minute it doesnt mean youre going to wake up tomorrow to uh to a bed full of roses it just means that while you wait heaven works gods always working no matter what the crossroads youre at in life when you are forced to face the trials and tribulations of life when you are at the point not knowing what to do or where to turn you can trust in god every one of us go through valley experiences every one of us are faced with these valleys these are part of the experience of life but every time we go through these valleys we need to know that hes there god may not he may not do what you think he may do the total opposite of what you think but hes still going to do something so many times we think god what have you done why have you left me out no man apathys not in that brothers vocabulary and he aint never late he made time he is time he has infinite wisdom he has all the information that could ever be known hes the alpha the scripture says in the omega so he stands at the end and makes decisions about now where we stand in the now and go with all the information we have we dont know why god youre not doing this and gods going oh thats because you dont have all the information yet theres a lot of things you dont understand yet and im navigating all those pieces to make sure what we do isnt fast but is right and is good and is noble lamentations says this the lord is good to those who wait for him to the person who seeks after him you have to know today that we are serving a god who is other than us its not a better version of you bigger version of you cleaner version of you his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts is what isaiah says so when you cant hear his voice speaking trust that his hands are working trust gods timing while you wait trust gods timing while you wait theres a reason for your delay see theres a reason for every season that we go through and if well not get bitter and upset well start to trust god in the middle of the season see i like a and i like z im not a big fan of l m n o p im not a big fan of the middle i like the beginning and the end but god says if youll trust me from l to m to n to o to p ill take you to z and youll be grateful because what im doing in you is more important than where youre going to what im going to do in you is more important than what ill do through you ive got to do something in you at g h i j k before you get to z you think youre ready for the blessing but im still preparing you im still working and its a process trust gods timing hes got a plan for you hes got a plan for your life in the season that youre in no matter how big your problems are if if you can spend time in the presence of god and you know that hes walking with you it overrides everything else thats going on in your life because you just know that hes going to take care of it some way somehow you just make sure that you stay in faith that you keep believing and let me work as long as youre believing god is working and ill tell you what we need to be saying more of and ive ive ive been doing this for a good number of years and its really really helpful when im waiting on something and then i start to think about how long its been and you know my mind starts to go negative i say out loud god is working god is working and it helps me because he is you know when you get a breakthrough god didnt start just working on that a second before you got it gods working in your life right now hes heard your prayers hes working in your situation but especially when youve prayed prayers for other people you have no control over how long it takes them to listen to god you work hard and youve believed god and youve been waiting what seems like forever for that kid to change or for your finances to change or for you to change or whatever but im here to tell you ive been there done that still go through it in different seasons at different times and i am telling you by the word of god and from my my experience and the experience of many others that god is faithful and i dont know how long you will have to wait but i do know that god will come through and i do know that you can enjoy your wait if you will just improve your attitude how we wait is possibly more important than what were waiting for if were going to spend all this time waiting why not wait with the right attitude why not live our best days even while were waiting for the destination you dont have to wait till you get to the destination to live out your best days you can start living out your best days even while youre waiting thats what god wants for us and i feel like god has this this thought with us he says listen theres a right way to wait and theres a wrong way to wait some people wait with impatience they wait with anger frustration twiddling their thumbs when are you going to be ready when are we going to get there are we there yet uh some people wait with anger why why have i not reached to where i want to be why have we not sold the house yet why why havent we moved into a house and sometimes we can get tired while were waiting on the next season of life and hope begins to wane in the waiting doesnt it because you begin to think okay well maybe tomorrows going to be the day well after so many maybe tomorrow is going to be the day the enemy begins to have a playground with your mind and go no yesterday wasnt the day and tomorrows not going to be the day im waiting here we as a people dont like to wait so at the end of the day what do you do when you feel like his voice is silent we trust that his hands are active his ability to work does not hinge on my perception of him working he is god almighty and paints on a bigger canvas than i can imagine this is who he is hes never missed a call hes never done something he wished he could take back hes never been so busy figuring out something that he missed you over here while you were doing your thing never one time has god failed and today wont be the day he starts and you wont be the person that he starts with this is the hope but remember what is hope its a positive expectation that something good is going to happen to me to have hope and expectancy is the hebrew translation for the word wait so hes not saying just wait like you know maybe this is going to happen or id kind of like throw you know throw a coin in a wishing well i hope this i wish this would happen no he says wait with an expectant heart that gods going to bring this to pass wait with great expectations and this is what isaiah says he says if youll wait upon the lord and youll wait the right way he will renew your strength you will mount up with wings like eagles you will run and not be weary you will walk and not faint thats gods promise to us that if we wait the right way were not going to get burned out were not going to get exhausted were not going to get impatient and settle for something less than what god has promised us to wait on were going to be able to hold steady in the middle of our waiting and not fall off not quit church not quit believing in god not give up on the promises sometimes when were waiting for a promise its easy to get exhausted while were waiting its easy to get impatient to feel burned out to just say you know what whatever im not going to church im not going to believe it im going to stop reading my bible when the promise comes to pass then ill believe that gods for me weve got to learn how to wait with expectancy that even while were waiting for the promise to come to pass gods with me hes for me hes working behind scenes it will happen god im believing that my best days are not behind me lord im believing the promise will come to pass whats in front of me is going to be greater than whats behind me lord what youre doing in me is greater than what is happening to me lord im standing on your promises i will not quit i will not give up im expecting a harvest in jesus name gods saying its time for you to wait with great expectations this season is important dont get bitter while youre waiting for the promises of god to come to pass while youre waiting for that family member to get back to church while youre waiting for that that loved one to give his life back to jesus while youre waiting for a house to sell while youre waiting to to to do that next season direction from god whatever youre waiting on god says wait with great expectations put your hope in the lord james chapter verse says that were called to wait like a farmer waits for the harvest a farmer is confident hes not stressed out hes not worried i dont know if the harvest is going to come no he knows harvest is on the way ive done my work ive planted ive done all the watering its just a matter of time before the harvest gets here see were called to wait with that kind of confidence god the promise is coming to pass what ive been praying for lord ive been sowing the seeds lord im expecting the harvest is on the way let me ask you a question when are you going to start thanking god for the miracle in your life you know that thing youve always wanted to happen that prayer youve always been praying that dream youve always had when are you going to start thanking god for you say well after it happens when you thank god after something happens thats called gratitude when you thank god for something before it happens thats called faith the highest form of faith is thanking god in advance before you get the answer but while you make the request what do you do while youre waiting you thank god say god you know that request i made the other day i thank you that the answer is already on its way its not here yet but i thank you that the answer is already on its way and you just keep thanking and thanking that is the highest form of faith you dont keep saying please give it please give it please give it please give it please give it you say god heres what i need now thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank that is faith thanking god in advance say thank you in advance for whats already yours its how i live my life thats why i why i am one of the reasons why i am today say thank you in advance for what is already yours true desire in the heart for anything good is gods proof to you sent beforehand to indicate that its yours already ill say it again true desire in the heart that itch that you have whatever it is you want to do that desire that itch thats gods proof to you sent beforehand already to indicate that its yours jesus said this in mark chapter anytime you ask for anything in prayer believe that you have received it and you will receive it now i really want you to get this notice the change in tense here believe that you have received it thats past tense and you will receive it thats future tense you say wait a minute ive got to believe ive got it in order to get it yep thats called faith i believe that ive got it already in order to get it youre saying you mean i got to believe a thing is so even though it isnt so so that it will become so yes thats called faith we all have dreams and goals that gods placed in our heart things were believing for situations were praying to turn around these promises start off like seeds they dont come to pass overnight theres always a period of waiting involved and from the time we pray till the time we see it come to fulfillment thats called the trial of our faith this is when many people get discouraged and give up they start believing the negative thoughts its never going to happen its taken too long now that seed is lying dormant its still alive it still has potential but you have to do your part and start watering the seed the way you water it is by thanking god in advance you cant wait till you receive the promise you have to thank god that the answer is on the way maybe youre struggling in your health the medical report doesnt look good dont talk about how you feel say father thank you that im healthy thank you that im strong thank you with long life youre satisfying me thats not just being positive thats watering the seed in your finances maybe youre struggling business is slow all through the day father thank you that whatever i touch prospers and succeeds thank you that im coming out of debt thank you that your favor surrounds me like a shield when you thank god in advance for the answer it not only waters the seed but that strengthens your own faith so often we think ill give god praise after the problem turns around ill thank god after business picks up after i see the solution now if you dont learn this principle to thank god in advance you wont have the strength you need to wait for the promise what keeps us strong is getting up in the morning saying father thank you that my dreams are coming to pass thank you that this problems turning around thank you that youre bigger than this obstacle giving thanks to god removes the anxiety you can be anxious and worried about anything you start thanking him praising him focusing on him and it is amazing how the anxiety disappears next thing you know you think well what am i worried about ive got holy almighty sovereign god on my side taking care of me why am i down in the dumps listen living in the dumps isnt gods plan and he can get you out real fast you start thanking him and praising him the devil runs and god gets you out youre rejoicing and praising the lord before you know it because anxiety and fretting over things is not the will of god were thanking god before the battle were thanking god in advance thats verbalized faith thank you god youre taking care of my bankruptcy thank you god youre taking care of my pain thank you god youre taking care of this conflict thank you god and im thanking god in advance once you pray and ask god to bring the promise to pass you ask god to heal you you ask him to restore a relationship from then on you dont need to ask god one more time he heard you the very first time now every time you think about it you should thank god that the answer is on the way one time daniel prayed and asked god to help him day after day went by nothing got better it looked like that god didnt even hear his prayer but on the st day an angel showed up and said daniel the first day you prayed god heard you and dispatched me with the answer but it took me days to fight through the forces of darkness what i want you to see is the first day you prayed god heard you the first time you asked god set the miracle into motion the very first day the answer was on the way thats why you dont have to keep praying about the same thing begging god asking again and again the answer is already on the way the promise is already in motion the breakthrough is already in route the right person is already in your future the victory is already up ahead of you you prayed about it now switch over into praise start thanking god that is coming start thanking him in advance for the healing the restoration the promotion the vindication the dream its headed your way you only need to ask god for it one time but then in all your future prayers you thank him does that make sense so you dont have to keep going please give it to me please give it to me please give it to me please like youre begging god no you just have to say god i want you to give this to me and then for the rest of the time until it arrives you just thank god thats faith some of you have prayed about the situation long enough youve got to switch over into praise get up every morning father thank you that my dreams are coming to pass thank you that healing is coming thank you that promotion is on its way thats whats going to keep you strong not begging not praying again and again no remember like daniel the first day you prayed god heard it and set the miracle into motion its already on the way as you keep giving god praise hes going to keep giving you strength to believe when are you going to start thanking god for that breakthrough in your life youve wanted it all your life but you havent been thanking god for it in advance you just been begging like you have to bargain or bribe or pressure god to say yes god wants to say yes hes waiting for you to show faith when are you going to thank god in advance when are you going to put the choir before the army in your life right now that many of you listening to me are just barely holding on its been a rough year and i want to tell you dont give up dont dont dont dont you dare give up hold on this too shall pass the tough stuff that youre going through it didnt come to stay it came to pass its not going to last the problems not going to last so dont give up on god dont give up on your marriage dont give up on your church dont give up on your dream dont give up dont give up look up look up jesus christ the son of god who created you who thought you up who loves you who has a purpose for your life who died on the cross for you who rose again and is coming back one day whos going to take you to heaven one day jesus christ is the secret of strength to make it to the end of your marathon and end well when we go through a bad season of life those circumstances that are oppressing us theyre very real but theres another reality and that reality that god is in the heavens and he is controlling and watching and all powerful over every circumstance in our life we have a choice are we going to focus on our circumstances or are we going to focus on our god things will start looking up when you start looking up in other words your circumstances will improve when you stop looking at them start looking to god let me say it again things start looking up when i start looking up you know in the bible theres a phrase thats used over and over and over and it is the phrase lift up your eyes said many many times in scripture its just one way of saying look up get your eyes off yourself and off your problems and off your circumstances and on to god refocus look at him things will start looking up when i start looking up when we look up and we see how big god is it naturally shrinks the size of our problems they just dont seem to be as big or as overwhelming when compared to the greatness of god i dont know what burdens youre bearing i dont know what grief or fear or anxiety or confusion you may be feeling right now but i do know this you need to look up instead of giving up dont give up look up in your disillusioned heart in your angst youve got your eyes focused on the wrong place until your eyes are fixed on the lord you wont be able to endure the days that go from bad to worse thats the key until your eyes are fixed on the lord you wont be able to endure the days that go from bad to worse the bible invites us over and over and over fix your eyes on me god says fix your eyes on me fix your eyes on me hebrews calls us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and the perfecter of our faith are you in the middle of a of a discouraging season fix your eyes friends fix your eyes back on jesus in a in a season of emotional pain fix your eyes on jesus do it once do it twice do it multiple times a day do it constantly throughout the day remember and rehearse who he is remember who he is remember what hes promised to do so when your schedules press when your prospects thin when your hope burns low when people disappoint you when events turn against you when dreams die when the walls close in when the prognosis is grim when your heart breaks because when life is crushing we dont have anywhere else to go because of who he is he will always do what is best for you now sometimes we have to talk ourselves off the ledge we have to remind ourselves of important truths like god knows what hes doing he doesnt make mistakes his timing is always perfect whatever is happening he is choosing to allow for this moment its challenging to trust and keep trusting but we have to because he is who he said he is and he will do what he says hell do this is the difference between ordinary people and great people great people never give up they never give up they keep on in the marathon of life even when theyre fatigued even when theyre frustrated even when they feel like failures and even when theyre fearful dont you dare friend give in without a fight fight back fight back against your discouragement fight back against the devil fight back against those who want to discourage you you got a great dream and at some point the devils whispers in your who do you think you are attempting to do this wrong question you should build your life not on what you think you can do but what you think god can do you let the size of your god determine the size of your goal its not about do you think i would have tried to do all things ive tried to do in life because i was depending on me not a chance in my flesh theyre dwelleth no good thing i know that i cant do certain things jesus said apart from me you can do nothing so thats pretty clear now how do you react when your plans take longer than expected when what you thought was going to take be done real quickly when you have a project and you go man this has taken me a long time to get through school its taken me a long time to get this thing built this has taken me what do you do you give in to selfpity you start complaining you start blaming other people friends if at first you dont succeed youre normal youre normal okay nobody succeeds at first the only way you actually succeed in life is by failing a bunch and learning what doesnt work failure is the stepping stone to success nobody ever succeeds without having failures success heres the difference between successful and unsuccessful people successful people see failure as a temporary setback unsuccessful people see it as a mark on their character well im a failure no no nobody succeeds at everything nobody has an unbroken record of success refocus on god stop listening to the negativity and resist the discouragement dont you give into it resist it fight it and who will give you the energy to fight it your lord and savior jesus christ so focus on him not on the problem when were at our worst gods at his best the stage is now set for god to work his will his way you see over and over again in the scriptures over and over again the stage is set for god to do his most amazing work when the situation looks the bleakest to us when you and i are fresh out of options when you and i are fresh uh uh at the at the end of our rope when you and i are at the end of ourselves and were full of fear and were full of uncertainty thats when god steps back rolls up his sleeves and starts to wow us again the challenge for us is not giving up too soon you know a lot of people start off great in life but even before they get to the halfway point in their life theyve already really messed it up and theyve given up which is worse than messing up here let me say it again giving up is always worse than messing up everybody messes up why do people give up in the marathon of their lives because they got discouraged choose to change the channel of your mind dont keep replaying all those discouraging images in your mind instead remember the lord choose to think about god and what hes faithfulness his love his mercy his compassion choose to think about god because your thoughts always determine your feelings do you want to stop being discouraged then stop thinking the way youve been thinking you know when bad days come into our lives we want gods to do something big something miraculous dont we our miraculous cure to the illness the immediate return of a prodigal the overnight breaking of a destructive addiction the erasure of the financial problems were suffering we want god to act dramatically and instantaneously sometimes he does that but usually thats not how it works its not in the big things instead its in that still small voice that god comes to give us courage to face that illness or the grace to accept that prodigals departure from god the ability the wisdom to handle the financial difficulty were experiencing thats how god speaks most often and when the waves are crashing and the winds are howling around us it is important that we learn how to listen to gods real but sometimes small voice in the midst of our bad season of life bad days are inevitable but they dont have to be paralyzing those who live a significant life learn to expect bad days and learn how to refresh themselves physically emotionally and spiritually you know i found that going through a bad season of life is a lot like traveling through a dark tunnel the bad news is in that tunnel it is dark you cant see in front of you you dont know if youll ever make it out but the good news is once youve entered into that dark tunnel with gods help youre already on the way out all of us run out of hope at some point am i right or wrong i think all of us do even that cup is half full sanguine soul who always goes around singing the sun will come up tomorrow even that person on occasion will reach up into the shelf for a can of hope and find there is no hope maybe thats where you are today maybe youre here more out of desperation than inspiration is there any hope are you asking that question youre running out of hope are you the single mom whos running out of hope are you the elderly person who has buried someone you love and your hope has left you are you the businessman who looks professional on the inside but its been a long time since you had a good nights sleep and you cant find peace are you running out of hope are you feeling like giving up are you close to despair dont do it dont the blackest moments we live through will last only a little time its pretty easy sometimes to to feel beaten that doesnt mean give up in fact it means the opposite it means its time for you to fight harder and im gonna tell you right now it wont be easy it will be hard because life is hard thats what life is and these challenges these challenges that you face theyre gonna do their best to take you down do not let them stand up dig in line up those problems and confront them face them fight them do not let them bring you down in fact in fact let those challenges raise you up let them elevate you let their demands and their trials make you stronger let the adversity you face today turn you into a better person tomorrow so so in the future you look back at these struggles and you say to them thank you you made me better you cannot keep a person down who wont stay down its one thing to be knocked down but the problem is you wont stay down there are already witnesses in this room who will testify its not that i havent been knocked down but god keeps giving me the strength the energy the wherewithal the anointing the power to not stay down that every time something or somebody knocks me down god keeps raising me back up see ladies and gentlemen life is not about not getting knocked down life is about not staying down you cant quit you come too far to quit now today i refuse to quit today i refuse to give up ive come too far to look back now amen has anyone else came too far to look back again we have come too far god has been far too good i refuse to quit no matter whats going on in our world today no matter what is going on in my temptations today no matter whats going on in my family with my friends at my job in my health i refuse to quit im not going to give up your situation may have changed your circumstances may have changed it may feel like its bigger it may feel like its greater but friend today our god has not changed he will never change the same god that helped you back then the same god that was with you in the beginning the same god that showed himself strong in your situation before is with you right now dont get this far down the road and turn around dont come this far dont overcome all those challenges and addictions and trials and what the world has thrown at you and then at this point in your life turn around its not worth it someone needs to hear this youre facing challenges youre facing addictions youre facing that affliction that temptation you need to refuse to quit you need to refuse to give up today some of you need to remember the history of victory that god has in your life do you remember all of those times where you said im not going to make it through this and look where youre at today i remember some of the darkest times of my life i would lay on the bed in tears i would lay on the bed sometimes without even words to pray and satan would whisper and say this is it this is the big one this is the last time youll ever have to go through this because your lifes going to be ending or this is going to ruin your entire life but guess what here i stand today but by the grace of god he delivered me time and time again and even when it seemed tough even when it seemed rough my god was faithful but see for some reason we go through a new storm we go through a new trial and we tend to forget all of the past and all of the times that god delivered us church today you need to remind yourself of the goodness of god there were things in my life that should have taken me out there were things in my life where i was going the wrong direction there were afflictions in my life that should have killed me but by the grace of god here i am today and you have the same story today church i want to encourage you theres been things in your life that should have taken you out but here you sit today breathing alive able to see able to talk able to walk because of the grace of god thats something to get excited about today we have a history of victory if god says you can make it guess what you can make it and you will make it no matter how negative it looks today youre going to come back its time to get up off the mat if youve been knocked down if youve been through something if youve been through financial setback or some kind of terrible thing has hit you in your health and or somethings happened to your family we need to believe that its time for a comeback its no time to quit its no time to give up its no time to moan and groan we may be down but were not out because we serve a comeback god and i want you to know the attitude of our god is im not going to give up on anybody im preaching to some people who have fallen behind and the enemys whispering to you give up the devil wants you to think its gone forever whatever it is that he stole from you its gone forever but it is not gone forever because god is planning you a comeback that if theres breath in our lungs hes not finished with us yet no matter how old you are no matter how bad youve missed it no matter how bad things look dont worry gods not finished yet if you havent seen the breakthrough gods not finished yet if you havent seen the miracle if things havent turned around for the good dont worry gods not finished see gods not setting us up to leave us halfway finished hes not setting us up to not finish what he started no he wants to bring us to a flourishing finish which means that our best days are right in front of us some of us in this room maybe weve had failed businesses failed marriages maybe weve made some bad mistakes and we think to ourselves gods done with me god cant use me hes not going to use me in ministry again hes not going to give me another business i declare bankruptcy you need to stop accepting those selflimiting beliefs those selflimiting lies those god limiting lies we serve a god whos never finished when theres breath in our lungs god can turn things around he can get you on the right track and i think many of us in this room have accepted limits that god didnt put on us we put on ourselves weve accepted caps that other people have said over this you cant do that youre too young youre too old gods done with you you messed up you screwed up you missed it youll never get out of this weve got to break those limitations off because weve accepted that we cant we wont and because we wont well never realize that we actually can today is the day to stir up that hunger to say with god all things are possible i can do all things through christ who strengthens me,1.0

beckett say ever tried ever failed no matter try again fail again fail better the world is yours treat everyone kindly inthe light of the night audience applauds you know my mother had me when she was years old and i used to sleep on the floor and i had eight uncles in that same house and they they dideverything under the sun you know going in and out of prison and my mother she worked at wendys

thats what builds character and he said i need youto understand the concept that theres anotherperson on the inside of you because one day in yourlife you will face something thats a lot tougher than

and immediately i got and so when my life changed not only did my football career end i got a paralyzed right arm and hand life changed overnight but i was extremely grateful for because the whole time i understood that you have to tap into in order to get through one ofthe darkest toughest roughest moments of your life theres another person on the inside upbeat music this was my shot i cried a lot it was so embarrassing i got fired from frasierthe one everyone knew was going to be a hit and it was this time it was really hard not to think that it wasnt meant to bemy career as an actress a couple of months later i was almost completely out of money then i got a call from afriend the actor richard kind who said and this isexactly how he sounds i heard what happened i dont know how youget up in the morning audience laughs how do you even get out of bed get dressed walk out thedoor and show your face audience laughs i was getting up in the morning and leaving my apartment so maybe i was coping betterthan i was expected to thats a good sign and i understand that because the s they areat that time in your life when youre really gettingacquainted to selfdoubt when theres so much seemingly at stake so let me reassure you itsnot supposed to be easy youre supposed to havemoments of uncertainty about which path to take because the s are full of crossroads and when one door closesanother door always opens it really does thats what i would tell myself to keep those momentsof doubts only moments and it worked i kept going then it all changed after many auditions i was the second person cast in the pilot called friends like us which would later be changed to friends jim burrows also directed this pilot and the first episodes of friends one day the six of uswere talking with jimmy exchanging the time i got fired stories and jimmy told them mine well shes got the worst one of all she got fired from freddie jerk well its a good thing you got fired or you wouldnt have been on this show he was right and it was a good thing ididnt get saturday night live and that romy and michele that that pilot didnt work out and every otherdisappointment that happened they were actually more like guideposts that kept me on my path oh and after i got fired from frasier i went to a birthday party and feeling like i had nothing at all to lose i flirted with a guy whowas way out of my league we dated and on thursday michel and i will have been married for years and well celebrate with ourremarkable twelveyearold son so thank god i got fired there is a reason for everything upbeat music i had a lot of failures i feel for funny things that i failed at a key primary school tests for two times and i failed three timesfor the middle school you know for three years i tried failing the universities so i applied jobs for times got rejected i went for a police theysaid no youre not good i went to even the kfc when kfc came to china come to our city people went for the job people accepted i was the only one guy and we went for police fivepeople four of them accepted i was the only guy did not receive it so to me being turned down rejected oh by the way i told you that i applied for harvardfor ten times rejected audience laughs i know ill be rejectedi just wanted to say that i think we have to get used to it were not that good even today we still have a lot of people reject us i dont think in thisworld a lot of people be rejected more than times if we you know the onlything we never give up the only thing likewere like a forrest gump we keep on fight wekeep on change ourself we dont complain whether you aresuccessful not successful i find that when peoplewhen they finish the job if they make a mistake and they fail if they always complete the others this guy will never come back if the guy only check himself yeah something wrong with me here something wont be there this guy has a hope upbeat music i said yes when i wanted to say no i dont want to do that he became physically violent with me id never been in anabusive relationship before i felt as if i didnt havethe profile of a woman who would ever be abusedverbally emotionally and sure not physically and i remember when thatrelationship finally ended and i was grateful thatit ended and i was alive because there are some days when my life was in danger i had so much guilt and anger and blame and more than anything shame how did i get here and the bigger questionwas how will i get out how do i move from this place i remember sitting in the doctors office sitting on the table and she asked me a myriad of questions she left the room and came back with a piece of paper in her hand and she said lisa youare clinically depressed and i need to give you this prescription and i looked at the piece of paper and it said lisa nichols prozac i didnt see that level of sad coming i think when sad comesyou dont know its coming its a little one little circumstance another circumstanceanother missed moment where you dont speak your mind another moment when you dontsay whats on your heart another moment when you say yes and you really wanted to say no another moment when you just put everyone else in front of you and here i was in the doctors office clinically depressed i asked my doctor couldi do something before i fulfilled the prescription could i try something else because when she said iwas really really sad what i realized was that i had just forgot who i was that i had become jilanismom thats all i was id become his fiancee thats all i was and then i was the woman that he abused and then i was the daughter trying to hide the abuse frommy father and my mother and then i was the motivational speaker trying to hide the fact thati was sad from everyone i just forgot who i was and so i asked her can i have days tojust discover me again and i did three things one i put affirmationsall around my house reminding me who i was you are an unrepeatable miracle you are beautiful in your own right you are you deserve healthy love you are a child of god everywhere i could look at my house was postit notereminding me of who i was i read scriptures and i read words that showed me my birthrightand then every day i got in the mirror and icompleted three sentences i looked in my eyes and i said lisa im proud that you and i found seven thingsto celebrate lisa for and the second sentence was lisa i forgive you for and i found seven different things to cut the shackles of blame shame guilt regret and anger around and i said lisa i commit to you that and i made seven differentcommitments to myself every day for days andwhen i went back to the doctor i was completely readyto take the prescription and fill it if i needed to when i share it with hershe asked me question after question after question again then at the end she goes i have two questions for you lisa i said what she saidwhat have you been doing for the last days and can i use it with other patients because i found my way back to me and another moment that imsuper super grateful for was when my daddy tookme on my first date i was years old and he took me out to a restaurant on thepier in marina del rey and he ordered my drinkand ordered my food and open the car door and all the things you would do on a great date that i didnt know anything about at and at the end of the evening i went to walk in the house and my father was openingholding the door open for me and he closed the doorso i could not get in and i stopped and i waslike daddy whats wrong and he said i want youto know something lisa tonight i took you on your first date so you get to see howyou get to be treated i wanted you to see howyou get to be treated now sweetheart how youchoose to be treated thats gonna be on you the big moments in your life are made up by the littledecisions you make i didnt make a big decision to get in an abusive relationship i made a little decisionto lower my integrity bar i made another little decision to stay when i saw the first signthat he didnt honor me the way i deserve to be honored i made a little decisionwhen i crossed over moved past that moment of discomfort and allowed his words tomake up for his behavior it was my job to fall madlyin love with me first that no one was going to show me how to love me that i have to show not only me how to love me but i had to show otherpeople how to love me that you are the first example of what loving you looks likein the way you love you is the way the worlds gonna love you so when you say i dont needrest then we believe you when you say no dont worry about me im fine we believe you when you say no i dontneed help we believe you when you say im fine bymyself we believe you so heres what i realized words are power words words speak life words your life as aphysical manifestation of the conversation going on in your head and its a physicalmanifestation of the words that are falling across your lips and if you want to create a better life design a better conversation if you want to designa better conversation think about a thought not about them but first about you and ifyou can feel it right now something stirring in your soul just that little somethingyou cant even describe it then youre still in the game it aint over yet its never too late at at at at at it aint ever too late to press reset and fall madly in love with the life that youve been givenand then youll look up and your life is barely then you look up and yourlife is barely recognizable im a girl from south central la living between the harlequin s and the rollin s had three fights a weekto get home from school got kicked out of college i was considered academically challenged im functionally dyslexic still i wear everything as a badge im fine with it im not successful in spite of it my success is beautiful because of it im that woman who was ongovernment assistance okay im that woman who got out ofabusive

woman before im a daughter im a woman first all things im not a hero i want to be a shero and i want to give her a chance and i say to you as your sister you dont think you get to press reset you better think again it is not over matter of fact it just begun upbeat music i was born with a silverspoon in my mouth i know i was born in follansbee west virginia audience laughs and i went by where i wasborn last night about i was born in a cellar athome delivered by dr mcgraw we had one bedroom for mysister myself and my parents we had a half bath and a kitchen seven half years we lived in that place there was no welfarethere was no food stamps there was no safety net buti always had plenty to eat cause every time i asked for seconds my dad would say no you had plenty audience laughs but the reason i wasborn with a silver spoon my dad had only gone to the third grade thats all the education he had but why was i born with asilver spoon in my mouth because i was taught by my parents that lifes a matter of making choices wherever you are good or bad because of the choices you make dont blame anybody else but if you get an educationyoure willing to work and overcome problems and difficulty in this great country youcan amount to something thats why i was born with a silver spoon i was in this country and i was taught personal responsibility for choices you make when we talk about acommitment to excellence thats a choice you make what do you want to do having hopes and dreams and ambition see i think that is absolutely critical dont make the mistake i made ive done a lot of dumb things but let me tell youthe one thing i regret we went to the university of notre dame we took a program on the bottom we took it to the very top and for nine straight years we went to a january one bowl the sugar the cotton theorange and the fiesta nobodys done it beforenobodys done it since we put it on top and we maintained it thats the thing i regret the most see theres a rule in life that says youre either growing or youre dying the trees either growing or its dying so is grass so is a marriage so is a business so is a person doesnt have a thing to do with age my birthday

void see everybody needs something to do number two everybodyneeds someone to love number three everybodyneeds someone to believe in and in my case is jesuschrist our lord and savior but the fourth

upbeat music i was years old when i got married i belonged to a very conservativefamily a baloch family where good daughters neversay no to their parents my father wanted me to get married and all i said was ifthat makes you happy ill say yes and of course it was never a happy marriage just about after twoyears of getting married about nine years agoim in a car accident soft music somehow my husband fell asleep and the car fell in the ditch he managed to jump out saved himself im happy for him buti stayed inside the car and i sustained a lot of injuries list is a bit long the radius ulna of myright arm were fractured the wrist was fractured shoulder bone andcollarbone were fractured my whole ribcage got fractured but that injury that changed me and my life completelywas the spine injury many people came to rescue they gave me cpr theydragged me out of the car and while they were dragging me out i got the completetransection of my spinal cord those two and a half monthsin the hospital were dreadful i was at the verge of despair one day doctor came to me and he said well i heard that youwanted to be an artist but you ended up being a housewife i have a bad news for you you wont be able to paint again next day doctor came to me and said your spine injury is so bad you wont be able to walk again i took a deep breathand i said its alright next day doctor came to me and said because of your spine injury and the fixation thatyou have in your back you wont be able to givebirth to a child again that day i was devastated i started to question my existence why am i even alive so what kept me going was one day i asked my brothers i knowi have a deformed hand but im tired of lookingat these white walls in the hospital andwearing these white scrubs bring me some colorsbring me some small canvas i want to paint so the very first paintingi made was on my deathbed where i painted for the very first time what an amazing therapy it was without uttering a single word i could paint my heart out i could share my story people used to come and say what lovely painting so much color nobody could see the grief in it only i could and that day i decided that im going to live life for myself i am going to be thatperfect person for someone i am just going to take this moment and i will make it perfect for myself that im going to fight my fears so i wrote down oneby one all those fears and i decided that im goingto overcome these fears one at a time you know what was my biggest fear divorce but the day i decided thatthis is nothing but my fear i liberated myself by setting him free and i made myself emotionally so strong that the day i got the newsthat he is getting married i sent him a text thatim so happy for you and i wish you all the best and he knows that i pray for him today number two was i wont beable to be a mother again and that was quite devastating for me but then i realized there areso many children in the world all they want is acceptance so there is no point of crying just go and adopt oneand thats what i did audience applauding and cheering i gave my name in different organizations different orphanages and i waited patiently two years later i got this call from a very small city in pakistan i got a call and they saidare you muniba mazari there is a baby boy andwould you like to adopt i could literally feel the labor pains yes yes i am going to adopt him i am coming to take him home and that day nael was two days old and today hes six you know when you end upbeing on the wheelchair whats the most painful thing people think that theywill not be accepted by the people because we in the world of perfectpeople are imperfect so i decided to appear more in public i started to paint i have done a lot of modeling campaigns i decided that im going to join the national tv of pakistanas an anchorperson i became the national goodwill ambassador for un women pakistan and now i speak for the rights of women children i was featured in bbc women for im one of the forbes under for so when you acceptyourself the way you are the world recognizes you it all starts from within we have this amazing fantasy about life this is how things should work this is my plan itshould go as per my plan if that doesnt happen we give up i never wanted to be on the wheelchair never thought of being on the wheelchair this life is a test and a trial and tests are never supposed to be easy so when youre expecting ease from life and life gives you lemons then you make the lemonade and then do not blame life for that it is okay to be scared it is okay to cry everything is okay but giving up should not be an option they always say thatfailure is not an option failure should be an optionbecause when you fail you get up and then youfail and then you get up and that keeps you going embrace each and everybreath that you are taking celebrate your life live it dont die before your death real happiness lies in gratitude so be grateful be aliveand live every moment soft music if you want to change the world start off by making your bed if you made your bed every morning you will have accomplishedthe first task of the day it will give you a small sense of pride and it will encourageyou to do another task and another and another and by the end of the daythat one task completed will have turned intomany tasks completed making your bed willalso reinforce the fact that the little things in life matter if you cant do the little things right youll never be able todo the big things right and if by chance you have a miserable day you will come home to a bed that is made that you made and a madebed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better to pass seal training thereare series of long swims that must be completed one is the night swim before the swim the instructors joyfully brief the students onall the species of sharks that inhabit the waters off san clemente they assure you however that no student has everbeen eaten by a shark at least not that they can remember but you are also taught that if a shark beginsto circle your position stand your ground do not swim away do not act afraid and if the shark hungry for a midnightsnack darts towards you then summons up all your strength and punch him in the snout and he will turn and swim away there are a lot of sharks in the world if you hope to complete the swim you will have to deal with them so if you want to change the world dont back down from the sharks over a few weeks of difficult training my seal class which started with men was down to just there are now six boatcrews of seven men each i was in the boat with the tall guys but the best boat crew we hadwas made up of little guys the munchkin crew we called em no one was over five foot five the munchkin boat crewhad one american indian one african american one polish american one greek american one italian american and two tough kids from the midwest they out paddled out ran and out swam all the other boat crews the big men and the other boat crews will always make goodnatured fun of the tiny little flippers the munchkins put ontheir tiny little feet prior to every swim butsomehow these little guys from every corner ofthe nation in the world always have the last laugh sailing faster than everyone and reaching the shorelong before the rest of us seal training was a great equalizer nothing mattered butyour will to succeed not your color notyour ethnic background not your educationnot your social status if you want to change the world measure a person by thesize of their heart not by the size of their flippers the ninth week of trainingis referred to as hell week it is six days of no sleep constant physical and mental harassment and one special day at the mud flats the mud flats are an area between san diego and tijuana where the rough water runs off and creates the tijuana sloughs a swampy patch of terrainwhere the mud will engulf you it is on wednesday of hell week that you paddle down in the mud flats and spend the next hours trying to survive this freezing cold the howling wind and the incessant pressureto quit from the instructors as the sun began to setthat wednesday evening my training class having committed some egregious infraction of the rules was ordered into the mud the mud consumed each man til there was nothing visible but our heads the instructors told uswe could leave the mud if only five men wouldquit only five men just five men and we could getout of the oppressive cold looking around the mudflat it was apparent that some students were about to give up it was still over eighthours til the sun came up eight more hours of bonechilling cold of chattering teeth and shivering moans of the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear anything and then one voice beganto echo through the night one voice raised in song the song was terribly out of tune but sung with great enthusiasm one voice became two and two became three and before long everyonein the class was singing the instructors threatenedus with more time in the mud if we kept up the singingbut the singing persisted and somehow the mud seemed a little warmer and the wind a little tamerand the dawn not so far away if i have learned anything inmy time traveling the world it is the power of hopethe power of one person a washington a lincoln king mandela and even a young girlfrom pakistan malala one person can change the world by giving people hope so if you want to change the world start each day with a task completed find someone to help you through life respect everyone know the life is not fair and that you will fail often but if you take some risks step up when the times are the toughest face down the bullieslift up the downtrodden and never ever give up if you do these thingsthe next generation and the generations that follow will live in a world far better than the one we have today and what started here will indeed have changed

opportunity that id been given my life got startedit was a little rough it was a little rough start i was born two months premature my mother was walkingup a flight of stairs and she didnt know this at the time but a woman shed hadan argument with earlier was standing above her holdinga pot of boiling water as my mom made her way up those stairs that woman dumped that water onto my mom and sent her tumbling down the stairs and into premature labor she received thirddegreeburns to over of her body and when we were finallyallowed to leave the hospital as you can imagine my momwas in a great

everything in the bottle when they found me theyrushed me to the hospital and my heart would stop andeventually i went into a coma but because of that accidentbecause of that incident the state of

that has to be the worst thing that could happen to somebody i have scars on my bodythat you cant see i have a burn here on my hand that she put there with an iron but all of that pain went away the worst thing thatmrs alexander would do is she would open the closet door she would stand over me and she would say youre stupid and you aint gonnanever amount to nothing and that hurt me more thanany of the physical kicks or the physical pain becausei believed it for a long time i believed that i wouldnever amount to anything just like she said i didnt know this at the time i found out a little

working toward that dream but that dream that youre holding in your mind that its possible that some of you already know that its hard its not easy its hard changing your life that in the process of working on your dreams you are going to incur in a lot of disappointment a lot of failure a lot of pain there are moments when youre gonna doubt yourself you said god why why is this happening to me im just trying to take care of my children and my mother im not trying to steal or rob from anybody how does this have to happen to me for those of you that have experience some hardships dont give up on your dream the rough times are gonna come but they have not come to stay they have come to pass greatness is not this wonderful esoteric illusive godlike feature that only the special among us will ever taste its something that truly exists in all of us its very important for you to believe that you are the one most people they raise a family they earn a living and then they died they stop growing they stop working on themselves they stop stretching they stop pushing themselves then a lot of people like to complain but they dont wanna do anything about their situation and most people dont work on their dreams why one is because of fear the fear of failure what if things dont work out and the fear of success what if they do and i cant handle it these are not risk takers you spent so much time with other people you spent some much time trying to get people to like you you know other people more than you know yourself you studied them you know about them you want hang out like

the greatest love story ever told powerful billy graham speech inspirational motivational video,the whole bible is gods love story toward us at the heart of the story we find the cross we see jesus willingly going to his death,the whole bible is a love story its gods love affair with the human race you see god has all those billions of planets out there all those hundreds of billions of stars and its all gods but of all the planets in the whole universe the whole universe stands in awe at the love that god showers on this little planet called the earth we are the only planet in so far as i know that are in rebellion against god and yet in spite of our rebellion in spite of our disobedience in spite of our sins god loves us thats the thrilling thing about it and god loves every person in the whole world with a love that is beyond our comprehension and god proved his love by giving his son on the cross if you ever doubt that god loves look at the cross because god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself thats the greatest illustration of love in the whole world is the cross because god is saying from the cross i love you i love you i love you you and i was saved by the cross our lord loved us so much that he gave his only son to die on that cross now love is not feeling you say i feel i love him its not feeling love is doing love is a verb god did something god gave his love god commendeth his love taught us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us the apostle john looking at that cross said behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us and when you look at that cross and think about it that the romans used the instrument of execution on a colossal scale and they put nails in the hands and spikes in the feet and spat on the people and mutilated the bodies broke their legs to help them die quicker and all sorts of terrible things the most cruel death in the whole world is the death of the cross and our lord was hanging there with the mocking crowd making fun of him and he hung there for you and you and you and god was saying i love you jesus laid down his life for us and thats the reason the scripture says theres no other way to heaven you cant be saved any other way you cannot find life with a capital l any other way you cannot gain entrance to the kingdom of heaven without coming to the cross because if god could have found another way he would have found it its gods love its so deep and so wide and so high and so great and has such dimensions to it that no words in any language can describe it its a love that god has for you that in spite of the fact that you were rebelling against him in spite of the fact that you were a sinner in spite of the fact that you broke his laws he gave his son to shed his blood in spite of everything weve ever done god loves and words cannot describe it and god says the moment you receive his son is savior he gives you the spirit of god to live in your heart and the spirit of god produces this love in you and through you thats the reason jesus said thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself its a supernatural love for your neighbor you may not like your neighbor but you can love your neighbor gods love in our hearts produced by the holy spirit supernaturally produced no i cannot love everybody but god can give me the capacity to love everybody and maybe your wife is youre irritable maybe you are irritable god can take you and change you and transform you and transform that relationship until you can fall in love all over again god can take you young people here tonight and forgive your past sins every one of them think of it every sin forgiven and make your heart just as clean as it was the day you were born and resensitize your conscience which is in danger of becoming hardened and give you a new tenderness and give you the real meaning of love let jesus christ come into your heart let him forgive your past sins let him change your life and say from this moment on i want him to be in control of my life i want him to sit in the cockpit of my life and run it and direct it i turn my life over to him tonight,1.0

life is short live every day for god billy graham inspirational amp motivational video,the bible says that your life is like a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away life is too short and eternity is too,time is short what is your life its even a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanishes away if someone had told me when i was years old that life was very short and would pass just like that i wouldnt have believed it and if i tell you that you dont believe it either i cannot get young people to understand how brief life is how quickly it passes it seems like yesterday i was in school every one of us here has been given the same amount of time in a day fourteen hundred and forty minutes a day hours per week seventy years god allows us and its interesting to me with all of our medical science weve never passed that magic mark the average american male today lives seventy years and four months the average female years and six months more people live to be but the average age of an american is still as taught in the scriptures what a thing it is when you think that you have just one short life to spend and it will soon be over id write down my priorities in life and id get committed to certain priorities now is the accepted time the things we ought to do the classes we ought to take the books we ought to read do it now the family that needs you spend more time now write that letter home now that youve been meaning to write money you ought to give give now time for study do it now people you ought to witness to do it now every time the clock ticks it seems to say now today if you will hear his voice there may not be a tomorrow for you and for me because theres a warning to time time is running out for all of us time is too short for indecision and vacillation do not halt between two opinions fools say the time is long every morning we have seconds to spend and to invest and each day the bank named time opens a new account for you and for me it allows no balances in no overdrafts if you fail to use the days deposits the loss is yours the bible says redeem the time because the days are evil and the days in which we are living are very evil if there was ever a time for the gospel that can transform the human heart its now jesus said as long as it is day we must do the work of him that sent us the night is coming when no man can work the night is going to come in your life yet there was a serenity about the work of the lord jesus its the quality of life not the length jesus only had years and it ended on the cross to the world he was a failure yet that moment yet at the end of his life he said i finished the work that thou gave me to do it doesnt matter whether you live another year or two years of five years will your work be finished is there a quality to it is there a dedication to it suppose all of our members tithe their time to witness for christ as we tithe our income for the church fill your heart with the word of god i found that those who know the scriptures are the ones that have the power today but we need men and women who walk with god and if you do that you too can finish the work that god gave you to do and help us to realize the brevity and the urgency of time and may we invest what little time we have in the kingdom of god,1.0

live a life of significance live for jesus tim tebow inspirational amp motivational speech,you dont have to make a billion dollars to live a life of significance by serving others and living a life that god would be proud of,when i was at the university of florida for every home game we had get in the bus at our hotel and we would drive right by the stadium and we would stop at whats called the gator walk and every game i played there there was probably twenty to forty thousand fans at this gator walk ready to greet us as we get off the bus i would see all these people i got to tell you there were a lot of voices that started to hit me one of the first voices that instantly hit me was was pride and arrogance because i would look out and i would see thousands of jerseys with my number on it i would look out and i would see bible verses that they were wearing because i wore them and so for a second you thought dang im something theyre here for me this is pretty cool i must be somebody theres a picture that i stumbled across and its one of times most influential images of all time and its the picture of this young girl shes on her way from her village to a feeding center not far away and shes so malnourished and shes moving so slow that this vulture is waiting to attack so the young man that took this picture i think there was probably something in his heart that he wanted to do good he just he wasnt sure so so he captured this picture and he just waited and and then the vulture got closer so he kind of shooed the vulture off and then he walked away and the vulture would come right back and he was told because of some of the sicknesses in the areas dont touch anybody dont do anything and so he didnt he didnt he did nothing because apparently the cost was too much so he left he went back the new york times published this photo in in he won the pulitzer prize for this photo four months after this he chose to end his life you see every single one of us we have a chance to be successful in life and you know what i hope you are i really do i hope youre successful theres nothing wrong with being successful but success is just about you but significance is about other people you see that man that took that picture he had success thats one of the greatest honors a photographer could ever have but obviously it wasnt enough it wasnt enough so whats gonna be enough for you you see success is great you can do a lot of things with it but its not going to be fulfilling and you can never forget that sense of urgency that its not about your timeline its about their timeline while you might have years they have days minutes moments she had moments but it wasnt worth it to go pick her up it wasnt worth it to give her a hug it wasnt worth it to tell her about the gospel yeah i won a pulitzer prize but what does it matter what does it matter it doesnt and i think the greatest tragedy in life is were going to look back one day and say i was successful in things that dont matter i want you to be successful but more than anything i want you to be significant and when you live for jesus and you love people i believe youre gonna have a life of significance,1.0
tragedy into triumph when god says no inky johnson inspirational amp motivational video,what would you do if everything you worked for your whole life was wiped away in one moment inky johnson who played safety,i come into my junior year and im about to get exactly what i want about to get this thing called nfl and im ten games away from this dream that i wanted my whole life right this thing that ive been working for my whole life my whole life is dedicated to this one game im up saturday mornings four oclock five oclock in the morning two miles to a fire station two miles back home im in the park at night doing everything in my life surrounded the game of football im sitting at home at night im throwing balls up to the ceiling and im catching them different type of ways trying to see if a receiver wants to check me if i want to catch an intercept like everything revolved around this game and i finally get in the position in my life to where now im ten games away from it ive got the paperwork that states im about to be an nfl draft pick nfl on top of the paper inky johnson projected top thirty automatic multimillionaire now all you have to do the hard parts over just play the next ten football games ink youve made it and i go out in a silly game against air force two minutes left and i go to make a tackle that i can make with my eyes closed and i hit this guy and as soon as i hit him i knew it was a problem but i didnt think it would be this type of problem like you know how when things happen like i didnt expect that but i dont think its gonna be anything too crazy and when i hit him every breath from my body left my body goes completely limp i fall to the ground i blacked out my eyes open im still not you know too concerned because its football i told pastor i never thought about a careerending injury you have injuries within the game when my eyes open guys run over ink lets rock man lets go lets finish them off and im like i cant like what do you mean you cant you are our starting corner get up you can nurse your injury after the game man like no i cant they said what do you mean you cant i cant move its a shock neck to my toes i cant feel anything shock leaves it stays in my right arm in hand im like maybe i got a bad stinger they put me on the spine board wheeling me off the field doctor says to me as hes walking beside me i dont know how youre still alive son you dont have any pulse we get to the ambulance my father standing there im like pops i laid it on him right i put it on him right my dads like yeah but i think you got the worst part of this one ink doctor say were gonna take you over run a couple of tests bring you back into the room everything will be cool they run the tests they bring me back into the room mom comes in kisses praise son youll be fine shes going to walk out doctors rush in head boy says hey man got to rush him back to surgery hes about to die and i look at him and i want to ask him like man you cant use another word like use a synonym brother why you gotta say die like you sure die man and he could tell from how im looking at him that im questioning him he says to me youve ruptured a subclavian artery in your chest youre bleeding internally if we dont perform his surgery tonight i guarantee you you wont be here in the morning from seven years old to years old bowled down to one moment the sacrifice the dedication the commitment came down to one moment and the next morning when i woke up from that surgery the nfl on my scale of life was that big sec championship that big cornerback that big i was embarrassed im sitting there and people coming into my room like inky man im sorry about what happened to you and im saying to myself man ink you really messed it up this time like man thats really the only thing you wanted huh like you just thought because you grew up in this socalled hood two bedroom home people like the only thing you really wanted was the nfl thats it im like man you limited god to that like life holds no substance no value like efficient but not effective i did things right but i never did the right thing and now the thing i place my identity in now it is gone thats why i laugh at people when they say man if i could just get this ill be man if i could just get this position ill be whoo man if i could just get this amount of money ill be im like but what happens even if you get it or you dont get it what happens when god says yes and no like do you have the ability to accept what you dont understand can you still see gods plan when it didnt go the way that you thought it would go can you handle when things get off course im sitting there and im thinking like man im eight games away and god is redirecting me and im like god just let me get to the nfl then redirect me like let me get the contract then redirect me so that i can help my family and gods like no son i need you to really go that way and im like you sure like man i need to go this way hes like no i need you to go this way i got something better it now i might take a little longer to manifest but i got something even sweeter like i got something more fulfilling i got something more rewarding i got something son thats gonna carry you for the rest of your life like its an amazing thing i knew this was what i was supposed to be doing when one day im backstage and i got the same feeling that i got when i used to be in the tunnel before i was running out in neyland stadium i said thank you god and so now i live my life a certain type of way according to what god has done i live my life a certain type of way according to the power that i know the lord possess i live my life a certain type like when i go to the lord in prayer i go bold and every time i go bold im so thankful that thats not me and my lords first time communicating and people have the nerve to ask me all the time inky why wouldnt you change what happened to you you got a paralyzed right arm and hand im like if you only knew and if you only saw the works that god has done in peoples lives around me what hes done in me yea its great its cool but what god has done in the peoples lives around me like you cant put a price on that like at a certain point like what is it really about like and i know the initial reaction when we go through things is to say man why does this have to happen to me and thats an honest reaction because sometimes good people go through some crazy stuff and some of the things we go through im just be real theres not a scripture for it its not you cant go hey go to romans theyre like what theres not but this is what ive understood in life some people dont need you to preach a sermon they need you to live one and so when they see you living it they can connect and identify with that the only thing i ask of you as talented as brilliant as powerful as beautiful as you are never allow life to make you forget why you started in the first place meaning that first time you said man im riding with christ lets go that first feeling you got like that first interaction that first connection you got like when you first got it its like when people say at the beginning everybody is excited everybody is on fire but at a certain point you hit something along the journey and its going to test that level of commitment at a certain point youre gonna hit something is gonna test that level of faith and my definition of commitment was always staying true to what i said i would do long after the mood that ive said it in has left like am i gonna stay true to my beliefs and my core and my essence of who i am as an individual even if i get a paralyzed right arm and hand am i gonna stay true to even if my career that i thought i was gonna have disappears am i gonna stay true to it even if one day im in a football game the thing i love to do the thing i have been practicing my whole life and then one moment it gets wiped out am i gonna stay true to it because depending upon if im gonna stay true to it a lot of other peoples belief in their christian journey is predicated upon that in my belief and my christian journey in other words ive seen a lot of other people say inky i want to give my life to christ not because of something that happened with me but because of something ive seen happen to you and so when espn comes to me and says ink you would be in the nfl right now like if you only knew if you only knew my father got saved because of my injury if you only knew my three boys that went first round to the nfl all of them got saved if you only knew if you only knew my mother the level of affect like if you only knew like i just seen god do some things through the injury and im like man every day i wake up i just try to stay out of his way im gonna leave you with this we already know what to do when god says yes we already know what to do when we get blessed we already know what to do when our prayers get answered but the question that i have for you and its rhetorical what will you do when god says no,1.0
one of the most inspirational talks ever rodney mullen the truth,for the full interview get motivated subscribe for,whats up its tony hawk and this guy right here is the godfather of all modern skateboarding tricks this is rodney mullen its such a gift to be able to look at something and to love it for the sake of it and nurturing and maintaining that is one of the hardest tests of any pro much less for anyone to find right what is the beethoven who never found his piano or harpsichord or right and like so for me i had an intuitive yearning that skating was for me and when im found these movements and the little subtle things that no one was pointing me telling me what to do because i have such a visceral push against being told what to do especially for this you know for the joy of what im doing youre going to tell me what to do i struggle with it theres days you want to go out it hurts to your sore or you just suck you youre youre not making progress youre ramming into and you feel defeated like sometimes after filming tricks it would be everything i could not from wanting turn my car off into the you know what i mean like you take it that personal but thats thats the nature of love you know its got hate in there you know its got pain in there and it draws you to it thats the magnetism thats what i guess i had that ive nurtured in my life i see people with talent with all those things but the one thing they dont have is that just love for doing it for the sake of it and the sense of obligation to do something with what youre given you know theres something to there its important riding for world industries the number one professional freestyle skateboarder for the last years at this sport lets give a big round of applause rodney mullen i think getting what you want quenches the fire that got you there often unless its something replaced by something more permanent which becomes more intangible i think the successes of winning right you want to be the best in the neighborhood and then win the local contest and then whatever whatever its it just keeps going up and then by the time you get there you can have a stadium screaming your name its actually happened a couple of times to me and there is a visceral accele acceleration to it there is ive experienced that i know what thats like you land a trick and theres it just lights up its crazy but at the same time its hollow its hollow thats not the thing that can drive you at least not for long its being able to say oh i had that i had a model or i had people autograph or whatever all of these honors eventually that stuff phase to just static and youre left with you and your board and if you decide that thats what you love thats what youre doing then your days are numbered so the trick is to always peel back of why am i doing this in the first place oh yeah i still like im still that kid on the farm and i cling to that even the things that hurt like the things that i grew up with the things that still like i got issues but i nurture them thats what gets me out every night it is easy to say and i think its smothering to say and often there is a culture of say that if if it cannot be proven it must not be possible best dudes around the world can be striving after one particular trick finally one guy does it and then the rest just come like lemming rarely is it a question of talent or technique at those levels its just one of belief and the concomitant will to kind of do something that either no ones done before or even more i think the crack open the barriers that people consider impossible undoable and that kind of belief i think is rare than talent talent is its around having both of those levels theres only a few people that that really have that i think in the history they are the ones that have really changed things speaking of umm going out and skating i know you skate till like what am yeah sorry i get home usually between and yeah umm alone yeah and youve been skating alone for years like that right in the middle of the night i mean there are people that are like theres rodney sightings i saw rodney skating this gas station at am as if its some rare thing and im like you saw rodney in his element theres lots of things that cannot be proven though they are correct and i think that this idea too with skating that because we see things so often in front of us the way that it should be done and it imposes a kind of barrier through what people know and see familiarity but maybe you can change something within you that can be just outside a new set of axioms some new skillset that will take you further and i think that thats the history of development certainly within skating so when you were in a contest thats good feels good especially the first time after that you are protecting the sort of only second place actually there is no second place theres only losing so contests were a big thing and a number by your name that was important so once youre on that treadmill youre on it and it it it militated against progression because it forced me into a pattern of consistency do this best in shot again and again and again and again make this to me thats never what drove me its interesting how getting what you think you want can end up being the force that pushes you into paint yourself into a corner pushes you into there is something terrible to be top of the mountain im the best im the king guarding it whats left for you well make it at the top but lightning you know so im privileged that i started a few some tricks and then other people have taken it more and thats turned into a vocabulary for us to express themselves that to me is like a living trophy because everywhere i look i see a few there but as for those things youre number one number one for that like most of those contests i didnt even give all i had i just played it safe those are representative of me being conservative not doing what i could have done because i just wanted to win because i was afraid i left the trophies like that have you broken out of that desire to just play it safe and win that helped me i cant say that im cured im human im insecure im all these things thats human nature were always fighting i dont think anyone ever gets to the top of mountain and kind of hovers you know oh im enlightened you know but im better im not as tethered it becomes what you are in the moment what kind of man are you and are you able to be there and that is something that i take with me with age with success that what you do in these reflexive couplings shapes you you shape it it shapes you you dont disconnect from there you just tumble forward over time they become what you do and you find hopefully at the end of that process youre not insufferable that you actually have something to give it can be present you know so for all ive done i appreciate it i dont look at it as much so a long time ago i go out like believe me im going out after this im going out tonight and ill go out cause i have something right now i can do im close and if i do something if i get it i filmed something and i will mean everything to me and i will but ultimately it just goes out there its just what you do you just become one with that i think thats been a key for me of why ive been able to sustain this fire thats so seemingly easily quenched so when i see people who have had success i see boredom for the most part in them and then i see a tombstone and circling back to what trophies and those things represented right feinman great physicist said that the nobel prize would be the tombstone on all great work just look at it i havent done the study of academy awards right but usually when you get what you thought you wanted fire goes away so if theres anything just find joy in what you do for the sake of it and then recognize how youre being shaped in the process and hopefully you become a better man through you know,1.0

when your heart is broken god loves the broken inspirational amp motivational video,jesus came to heal all kinds of brokenness there are so many things that can break our hearts but god is good at healing them,ive come here today to tell you something god has a plan for your life i dont care who you are where youve been or what youve done i dont care what somebody else has done to you i dont care how bad life is treated you how unfair life has been or how stupid you have been for i know the plans i have for you plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future for days i would pull that out every morning but read that scripture sometimes i would go off for a walk and i would just quote that scripture over and over to myself and it took me a a while of quoting that scripture to actually believe that scripture could apply to me i thought it applied to a bunch of other people but not to me a hope a future im damaged im rejected some of you just need to know today that god is the god who restores what is broken we throw away things that are broken we discard things that have deteriorated because we determined that they no longer have value all right not with god god loves broken things and broken people because god will take broken things and broken people and mend those things and make them whole and reclaim them for his glory that those things and those people might live according to his grand purposes for their lives but the fact is god can only use broken things god can only use broken hearts hearts that are humble before him there was a revivalist an author by the name of dr vance habner who once said and i quote god uses broken things it takes broken soil to produce a crop broken clouds to give rain broken grain to give bread broken bread to give strength it is the broken alabaster box that gives forth perfume it is peter weeping bitterly who returns to great power than ever close quote and its so true that broken heart god can use god uses broken people why because broken people are humble and he resists the proud but he gives grace to the humble god uses broken people he bestows upon our brokenness his grace and his mercy his patience and his kindness heres the thing ive learned about life either accept the seasons over or cry about the rest of your life but when the seasons done the seasons done you gotta be okay with it you gotta know that god has a bigger plan god knows what hes doing even when it doesnt make sense to us dont dwell in the past see im doing a new thing he goes on to say its just begun ive already done im already starting im already in the middle of a new thing god saying im already there you might as well join me but youre still over here crying over what whats lost you know what ive learned to do in my life by the way dont focus on who left focus on who stayed theyll focus on whats lost focus on whats left we gotta learn to do that revelation says this he will wipe away every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away he who was seated on the throne said i am making everything new my favorite lines of jesus he said im making everything new theres a reason im going through this im making everything new when god comes in to renovate he he comes in to knock down the old stuff that he might create something new with heaven before you the best is always yet to come heaven is still before us amen stop feeling sorry for yourself god can restore the years even that you wasted he can restore the years of the locus have eaten you know he cant do anything about yesterday but you can start right now today is the first day of the rest of your life in christ always because of his great mercy and his grace toward us god can recover all of that doesnt mean that you know the your spouse may come back to you or or all of this and you know but god can still use all things romans if you will turn to him he works all things out for good to those who love god who are called according to his purpose and god is calling you today but you will know that he is that he is god and there is no other god when god creates something beautiful out of ashes and god does something wonderful does something out of nothing in my life there was one american artist that noted that when the japanese mend broken things that oftentimes they will aggrandize the damage done to that thing by filling in the cracks of the broken object with gold interesting they would fill in the cracks with gold because they say when something has been damaged now it has a history and now its more valuable its more beautiful i love that thought you see god is in the business of using broken people lost people lame people hes in the business of taking them and changing them and teaching them how to fish for people to find those lost souls who want to be found who are ready to change their life you might be thinking my brokenness and my experiences and my trials disqualify me when you commit your life to christ those things can be used by the lord to reach others the lord uses the broken to reach the broken second corinthians god comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others with the same comfort we receive from god god uses our pain to help others god does not want you to waste a hurt it says in second corinthians verses the god of all comfort comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others with the comfort we ourselves have received from god gods people are so powerful people ask me sometimes where is god and all this whenever a tragedy happens ill have people say where is god in all this and i always smile and say hes in all the people around you right now helping you thats where god is in all this you know its interesting too it says here that the god of all comfort comforts us and says so we can then do what we can comfort others with with the same comfort we ourselves received what thats saying is that whatever pain youve gone through god never wastes a pain he doesnt do that he recycles it so whatever you go through youll eventually be able to help someone else go through in fact some of you are going through something right now and the only thing thats going to get you through it is knowing that one day i will help other people go through what im going through god is able to mend broken hearts broken homes broken hopes broken health broken joy it doesnt matter what it is jesus came to heal broken people amen how many of us would be included in that promise were all broken were all dysfunctional and im so thankful for the good news of the gospel that he heals us and then uses us to help other broken people,1.0

up here to say thank you to god for giving me this ability for blessing me for shaping me for chastising me for teaching me for punishing me for allowing me to be a vessel and touch people around the world so keep working keep striving never give up fall down seven times get up eight without commitment youll never start but more importantly without consistency youll never finish true desire in the heart for anything good is gods proof to you sent beforehand to indicate that its yours already that itch that you have to be whatever it is you want to be that itch that desire for good is gods proof to you sent already to indicate that its yours you already have it claim it understand this understand this also you have these dreams dreams without goals remain dreams just dreams and ultimately fuel disappointment dreams without goals yearly goals life goals daily goals monthly goals hourly goals minute by minute goals dreams without goals are just dreams and they ultimately fuel disappointment goals on the road to achievement cannot be achieved without discipline and consistency you understand between goals and achievement our discipline and consistency i pray that you all put your shoes way under the bed at night so that you got to get on your knees in the morning thank god for grace and mercy and understanding we all fall short of the glory we all got plenty just if you just start thinking of all the things you got to say thank you for thats a day so you have all been given these gifts and we all have that unique gift to go out and touch people to affect people understand that gift protect that gift appreciate that gift utilize that gift dont abuse that gift treasure it you have it all you already have it and finally ill say this youll never see a uhaul behind a hearse ill say it again youll never see a uhaul behind a hearse ive been blessed to make hundreds of millions of dollars in my life i cant take it with me and neither can you so its not how much you have its what you do with what you have and we all have different gifts some money some love some patience some the ability to touch people but we all have it use it share it thats what counts i found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks nothing nelson mandela said there is no passion to be found playing small and settling for a life thats less than the one youre capable of living im sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on but i never understood that concept having something to fall back on if im going to fall i dont want to fall back on anything except my faith i want to fall forward this is what i mean reggie jackson struck out hundred times in his career the most in the history of baseball but you dont hear about the strikeouts people remember the home runs fall forward thomas edison conducted failed experiments did you know that i didnt know that because the and first was the light bulb fall forward every failed experiment is one step closer to success youve got to take risks and im sure youve probably heard that before but i want to talk to you about why thats so important first you will fail at some point in your life accept it you will lose you will embarrass yourself you will suck at something theres no doubt about it embrace it because its inevitable and i should know but heres the thing i didnt quit i didnt fall back i prayed i prayed and i prayed but i continued to fail and fail and fail but it didnt matter because you know what theres an old saying you hang around the barbershop long enough sooner or later youre gonna get a haircut so you will catch a break and i did catch a break heres my second point about failure if you dont fail youre not even trying ill say it again if you dont fail youre not even trying my wife told me this great expression to get something you never had you have to do something you never did les browns a motivational speaker he made an analogy about this he says imagine youre on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential the ghosts of the ideas you never acted on the ghosts of the talents you didnt use and theyre standing around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the grave together so i ask you today how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes so you got to get out there you got to give it everything you got whether its your time your your your talent your prayers or your treasures what are you going to do with what you have because the chances you take the people you meet the people you love the faith that you have thats whats going to define you never be discouraged never hold back give everything youve got and when you fall throughout life remember this fall forward number one put god first put god first in everything you do everything that you think you see in me everything that ive accomplished everything that you think i have and i have a few things everything that i have is by the grace of god understand that its a gift ive been protected ive been directed ive been corrected ive kept god in my life and has kept me humble i didnt always stick with him but he always stuck with me so stick with him in everything you do if you think you want to do what you think ive done then do what ive done and stick with god number two fail big thats right fail big you only live once so do what you feel passionate about take chances dont be afraid to think outside the box dont be afraid to fail big to dream big you have to work at it every day you have to plan every day youve heard the saying we dont plan to fail we fail to plan hard work works working really hard is what successful people do dont confuse movement with progress and anything you want good you can have so claim it work hard to get it when you get it reach back pull someone else up each one teach one dont just aspire to make a living aspire to make a difference,1.0

seek god first hour powerful motivation inspirational amp motivational video,we must start with god first and make him our first priority support the channel shop,never has uncertainty been any greater than it is today in uncertain times because as uncertain as things are of this i am certain that god almighty is still on his throne i am certain that the word of god is true from page to page and cover to cover i am certain that every promise locked in these pages is good for a thousand generations i am certain that even though men on this earth may plan and they may plot and they may have devised schemes and try to control the things of this earth it is god who exalts one and it is god who uses men here on this earth i am certain that god is a healer i am certain that god is faithful i am certain that god is all sufficient i know that he has given his angels charge over me i know that he will protect me i know that he is a help to the helpless and hope to the hopeless i know that his goodness and his mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever i know in whom i have believed and i believe that he is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that i can ask think or imagine i know who he is his name is jesus christ and he is a resurrected savior the son of the living god the bright and the morning star the fairest of ten thousand the lion of judah and he is a sooncoming king of this i am certain and the reason i know is because his word has told me his holy spirit has confirmed in me and i hear his voice saying lift up your heads and rejoice your redemption draweth nigh our god is a refuge and our god is a strength and he is an everpresent help in a time of trouble jesus christ loves you and i know you may have issues and you but youre doing better than you think you are somebody needs to know today youre going to make it somebody needs to know today youre doing all right you may not be what you ought to be but youre not what you used to be and youre going to get there by gods grace dont you give up dont you quit and dont you keep putting yourself down youre doing better than you think you are heres the assurance that we have not that we would go through life without difficulty not that we would go through life without struggle not that we would go through life without some storm of some kind or some need arising but that when we go through life we go through life with the promise that in our struggle he is our strength in our struggle he is our provider in our struggle he is our healer in our struggle we have a firm foundation and jesus is his name ecclesiastes chapter gives times and seasons in life it says theres a time to be born theres a time to die theres a time to laugh theres a time to cry theres a time to dance theres a time to mourn theres a time to gather theres a time to to to to let go all kind its different times in life the one time i cant find in there is the time to quit there is no time to quit in your life in this if youll keep going thats how you get to heaven tell somebody this is no time to quit you may have bars you may have chains but youre still blessed god loved you so much that he gave his only begotten son to die for you what shall we say of these things if god before us who can be against us seeing that he has given us his only begotten son how will he not give us all things there is not one ounce of defeat in these words so dont you let the attitude of defeat come into you because god created you to be more than a conqueror you will go through a season of lack but god created you to conquer lack you will go through a season of weakness but god will bring you through that season of weakness stronger than youve ever been before you need to understand what david said when he said it was good that i had been afflicted why because it was in his affliction that he learned gods faithfulness it was in his affliction that he learned how to run into the secret place of the most high and dwell in the shadow of the almighty it was in his affliction that he learned the words god is a refuge and god is a strength the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are saved when you come into a season of struggle like youre in right now do not be defeated because if youre breathing and the sun is shining then god has a purpose for you im speaking to families right now that dont know what to do theyre overwhelmed turn to jesus hes for you im speaking to businessmen who are looking at the future forecast and theyre uncertain about where the provision is going to come from turn to jesus hes a business partner that will provide for you but dont let defeatism enter your heart your mind or your spirit because we are more than conquerors through christ its awfully hard when i dont understand what god is doing it takes real faith to trust in god when i dont understand why god has allowed certain things to happen but i am convinced that gods ways are better than my ways and im convinced that his ways are far wiser than my ways its one thing to worship god because youve got a nice house because youve got a nice car because everythings good because all your people are blessed thats wonderful but its another thing to worship god in spite of trials and bars and chains and tribulations and heartbreaks and tears when you can do it then when you can praise in pain when you can lift your voice and say the lord gives the lord takes away i dont praise you because of i praise you in spite of my hardships youre worthy of the praise its not about you its about him do not be afraid we know all things work together for good when you have that attitude it takes the adversity that youre in and it shapes you and it molds you when you have that attitude you look at struggle as a season for you to gain strength and for it to pour the rockribbed confidence into your soul that god is on his throne and everything is going to be all right when you have that attitude that we know all things work together you can say this is the day that the lord has made let us rejoice and be made glad in it because the man of faith has the promise of god that god is going to take care of him that god is going to supply and the man of faith realizes that god has means that he isnt aware of god has resources that i dont know anything about and thus though things look to be hopeless and dark yet i dont look at the circumstances the man of faith looks at the lord who is above all of our circumstances and he doesnt look to his own abilities but he looks to gods ability to take care of him and to supply for him and thus he rejoices because god is on the throne and god has promised to take care of me today i want you to make the decision wherever you are to rejoice rejoice that youre saved rejoice that the blood of jesus is strong enough to conquer every sin and every shackle of shame in your past it is strong enough to conquer every disease and every sickness in your body it is strong enough to protect you you rejoice that god has a plan for you he has a plan to prosper you and not to harm you he has a plan that is far better than you could ask think or imagine rejoice that in the darkest of midnights the name of the lord is a light and it is a salvation rejoice that in the midst of the storm you are worshiping the master of the wind rejoice that in an hour of need he is still el shaddai the allsufficient one rejoice that in a day of trouble many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers them out of them all child of god you have a reason to rejoice today because we know all things they work together for good all things arent good but we have a god whos greater and he said ill use it for good all things work together its an outlook that says if god is for me who can be against me if god loves me if god cares for me if he has a purpose for me then no adversary seen or unseen shall come near my dwelling god is on the throne you have the promises of god the lord will take care of you god has provisions that you dont even know about and so rejoice be lifted up that is the position that faith takes above the circumstances not looking at the circumstances but looking to god who is in control so i want you to ask yourself what is your outlook today are you determined are you in denial are you walking around in defeat dont deny the problem because the problem is real but the god that you serve is greater dont deny that the world needs jesus now more than ever you see when youre called according to gods purpose you call upon his name and i assure you of this in his name you find provision you find peace you find protection you find direction you find health you find satisfaction you find sufficiency you find righteousness you find comfort when you call upon the name of the lord that means that theres not one hour of one day that you will face one situation when jehovah god your god the great i am does not have the strength and the power to sustain you call upon his name and he said ill answer you and show you great and mighty things that you know not no matter what you face in this life as long as you can call upon jesus you can overcome anything i dont know what you may be going through today it could be that you have that feeling that god isnt hearing you when you pray or maybe that you even feel worse than that that god doesnt care that god isnt concerned but i can assure you from the word of god that he does care and he is concerned and he tells you to just cast all your cares on him because he does care for you and so i would encourage you to look up quit looking at the problem quit looking at the circumstances quit being overwhelmed by your weakness and ineptness to take care of the situation and look to god who has promised to take care of you and to provide all of your needs but i dont see where you dont have to he has resources you dont know anything about when you face a problem that you cant answer call upon jehovah because jehovah jireh means hes the god who can see there are men sitting in office buildings that are empty trying to see their way to a solution call upon jehovah jireh he sees your provision before you ask for the need when the weight of the world has pulled you to your knees and youre about to break under the pressure of fear call upon jehovah shalom he is the prince of peace and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will rule your heart and mind in christ jesus when you feel abandoned and alone call upon jehovah shama hes the god whos there when your soul is barren and dry and youre searching for some form of satisfaction call upon jehovah mckeddish because he is the living water who will satisfy if youre needing healing call upon jehovah rophe hes the healer but whatever you do do not be defeated do not live in denial live in determination that god is for you and therefore no one can be against you when i look through the scriptures every famine that happened every economic downturn every plague every disease the people of god were sustained through every season that the world went through because they put their trust in him because when your trust is in the lord you are secure you know its easy to say that we trust god when everythings good and everythings happy and all is going according to plan we say oh yeah im just trusting the lord and look how good everything is but its a whole other deal to trust god when things are not so good you see to trust god means you have to allow him to do what he wants to do even if he fails and you say well he cant fail hes god and thats the point he cant fail therefore we must trust him enough to let him succeed but to let him succeed on his terms and in his way and in his time not on my terms or in my way or in my timing to trust god is to say im going to let god do what he wants to do lord im not gonna argue with you im not gonna fight im not gonna resist im gonna let you do what you know is best and i am not going to fear the outcome the lord the lord is my shepherd and i shall not be in want in other words god says i will take care of all your needs if youll just trust me the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me the bible says it like this in first peter dear friends dont be surprised or shocked when you go through painful trials and fiery tests in life the bible says in the world you will have tribulation second corinthians chapter verses and says this for our temporary listen its not going to last our temporary and momentary troubles will not last but they are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we focus not on what is seen the problems around us but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary its not going to last but what is unseen is eternal sometimes when youre following jesus he leads you right into a storm remember in the new testament there are two times when the disciples found themselves in a storm in a boat they thought they were going to die both times but they were in the storm they were in their trouble not because they were doing things wrong they were in trouble because they were doing things right they were following jesus they were obeying what he told them to do they were following his directions and his directions led them right into a storm but if they had not been in those storms they would never have discovered truths about jesus there were things that they saw about him they had never seen before and they never could have learned them any other way except by going through the storms that they experienced my tendency when it comes to storms is i want to go around the storm if i see it coming up on the horizon i want to find a way around the trouble but sometimes god wants to lead you straight into the middle of it all because the lord has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and so you follow him into the middle of it he says trust me because the lord has his way in that when you are in the middle of the storm thats when you look for god always look for god in the way things are not in the way that you hope they will be but look for god in the way things are because he is not waiting for you on the other side of the trouble waiting for you to figure it out and find your way through he is in the middle of it walking with you working his way and his will but youve got to trust him in it so when god says do you trust me well then you have a decision to make will you allow him to do what he wants to do and not fear the outcome because to fear the outcome says lord i dont really quite trust you will you allow him to do what he wants to do and not fear the outcome focus on what never changes in the days ahead thatll give you stability dont focus on whats ever changing because we dont know where its all going to end up you say well what are the unchangeable truths that uh that arent i should focus on well god sees everything im going through focus on that god cares about everything im going through thats unchangeable god sees and he cares god has the power to change what im going through he has the power to answer prayers thats unchangeable god always acts out of his goodness to me thats never going to change no matter what happens god is always going to act good to me gods plan is always better than my plan i may not see it but its better because hes a good god god will never stop loving me thats never going to change in your life these are things you need to focus on the things that never change gods love for me gods grace for me gods goodness for me remember this remember that no matter what i go through god will go through it with me every stage every phase every crisis no matter what i go through god is gonna go through it with me you will never really ever be alone god is with you hes with you right now god has never been closer to you than he is right now hell never be any further away than he is right now and remember the great promise of isaiah verse when you go through deep waters i will be with you when you pass through the rivers of difficulty you will not drown when you walk through the fire you will not be burned up it will not consume you thats what you want to focus on maybe a little less listening to the internet and a little bit more listening to god that will give you confidence that will give you stability that will replace your panic with prayer it will replace your worry with worship it will replace your anxiety with adoration you have to believe that god knows what is best that he will not abandon you he will not let go of you that you will not be destroyed by this trouble you have to take him at his word when he says i will never leave you or abandon you you have to take him at his word when he says i take all things and work them together for your good the seed of faith the seed of faith planted in the soil of adversity under the watchful eye of the gardener will bring forth life and beauty in its season the bible says that god makes all things beautiful in their time the trouble that you are in will not last the trouble will not last it is light and momentary compared to the eternal glory that awaits you it is all about your perspective how you see the trouble is how you will face the trouble if you see it in fear youll face it in fear if you see it in doubt youll face it in doubt if you see it in faith you will face it in faith so dont see it as the end see it as the beginning you have to look through eyes of faith through a lens of hope a lens of expectation remember this is not the end of the story because we dont know what the future holds but we do know who holds the future we dont know all thats going to go ahead but were not frightened by it because we know the end of the story weve read the last chapter of the book we know that god is in control we know that god is not surprised by this that god is bigger than this and romans is still true all things work together for the good of those who love god with the called according to his purpose if the truth be told we were being totally honest most of us dont like waiting particularly if were waiting for something to change or something to get better waiting can be a very frustrating experience but the worst kind of waiting of all is waiting on god when god forces you to wait for things to get better in your life for things to improve to change to reverse and nothing is happening and yet over and over and over and over and over again in the bible were told to wait on the lord the most difficult place for you to be in life is in gods waiting room in gods waiting room some of you are in gods waiting room right now what is gods waiting room when youre in a hurry for something to happen and god isnt thats gods waiting room some of you are in a hurry to graduate some of you are in a hurry to get married some of you are in a hurry to start a family some of you are in a hurry to launch a new business to to close a big deal some of you in a hurry for a big goal a big dream a big accomplishment some of you are in a hurry for all kinds of different things and god isnt we as human beings hate to wait and we especially struggle with waiting on god have you ever been in a hurry when god wasnt and your god i know youre going to come through and im praying this really godly prayer i know its your will so where are you why arent you coming through and youre in the waiting room of life and we get so impatient we want to hurry god up and we want things right now and some of you been waiting for god to come through and youre about to give up and youre getting discouraged and you realize that gods standard time is not always running on my time and its in the waiting rooms of life we learn to trust god the most in those difficult waiting rooms of life thats where god grows us and builds our character the most through the pain of waiting we learn to trust god and without faith its impossible to please god thats when he builds our character you see while youre working on your project your goal your dream your vision gods working on you and gods much more interested in you than in what youre trying to accomplish because youre not taking your accomplishments to heaven but you are taking your character and sometimes god says yeah i intend to give you what ive promised you i intend to answer that prayer i intend to fulfill the vision but youre not ready yet i want you to grow and when youre ready then its going to happen a lot of times we think were waiting on god for something to happen like a prayer to be answered god says youre not waiting on me im waiting on you im trying to prepare you im testing your faith will you trust me but im also trying to grow you up because the blessing i want to give you so much bigger than you can handle right now youre not ready for it you cant handle it yet another thing you have to learn in life is that a delay is not a denial theres a big difference between no and not yet now immature children dont know the difference you tell a kid not yet they start crying and having a hissy fit because they think it means no they dont understand a delay is not a denial god is saying i i intend to do these things in your life that ive given you the vision the dream to do but youre just not ready yet and at the right time i will answer your prayer gods often waiting on us now why is this important because when youre in gods waiting room you fall temptation to all kinds of negative emotions you start worrying you start stressing out you get anxious you get irritable you get spiritual add you can get envious you can get jealous hey he got a promotion i didnt get the promotion shes having a baby im not having a baby she got engaged i didnt get engaged hes starting a new business thats taken off what about mine and and all these kind of negative emotions can come into your life and then you get frustrated and then you start having a pity party so what does god want you to do when youre in the waiting room of life and because youre going to go through it many many times god is not a vending machine where you put in the prayer and then you pull the thing and you instantly get it theres always a delay the delays are by design the delays are by design to teach you to trust him and to grow up in your character hey a delay is not a denial theres a big difference between no and not yet for those of your parents you understand this theres a big difference between telling your kids no and not yet its just not time yet and a delay is not a denial we see it all through scriptures god told noah to build a boat that would save his family from a great flood but it didnt rain for years god told abraham hed be the father of a great nation but he didnt have his first child until he was years old god told moses that he would lead the people out of slavery from egypt theyd been in for over years but then god sends moses out into the desert for years to wait god gives joseph this great dream that hell save his family and his people from famine and hell be a great leader but then joseph gets sold into slavery he gets falsely accused and imprisoned and hes waiting there in prison until finally god takes him from prison and positions him second in command in all of egypt and the promise comes true king david god had king david anointed as king but he didnt really get to be king until years later even jesus christ spent his first years waiting in a carpentry shop before he started his earthly ministry see a delay is not a denial when god delays sometimes we feel forgotten psalm says how long o lord will you forget me forever you come to a point sometimes of believing that god has forgotten you dont worry its a common experience we all go through it one time or another feeling that god isnt there or at the very least hes forgotten us perhaps our problems arent important to him we imagine the psalmist encounters those very doubts in psalm chapter and verse heres what he says there why do you stand afar off oh lord why do you hide in times of trouble what you believe is that he has given up on you you may even be feeling that way right now if so please allow me to remind you that what youre contemplating is a simple impossibility god never gives up on you he never ceases to care about you and he will not abandon his work on you of which your trial is a part he even says that your name is written on the palms of his hands your very name is tattooed on the palms of gods hands it is engraved there it cannot be removed and such is gods concern for you he cannot forget you no matter what storm youre weathering now you have never left gods mind or his heart yes sometimes when god delays we feel forgotten but god never delays without a purpose he knows you he knows your heart he knows everything youre asking him for if hes not doing what you think he should do just be patient because god loves you dont forget hes got your name tattooed on his palm he knows who you are he hasnt forgotten and he never will that often gods timing disappoints us you know theres something maybe something youve been praying about for a long time and you really you need an answer you know maybe youve been um praying for something really specific and you needed god to show up within a particular time frame you know its an urgent need and he doesnt when god doesnt answer when you need him to i wonder what conclusions do you come to do you think to yourself you know did i do something wrong did i ask the wrong way do you find yourself asking does god even hear my prayers so often we think when god doesnt answer in our way or in our time that its because he doesnt love us god loves you he doesnt love anybody else one grain of sand more than he loves you you know in those darkest moments of life i want you to hear jesus looking right through your fear and saying to you trust me i am right here gods timing might not have been everything you hoped for in your life but i hope you understand that you can trust the one who keeps the time clock we dont like to trust somebody elses timing why because if we lose control and so wed rather than trust god because trusting god means my goodness i actually have to trust god wed rather go listen i like the plan and purpose you have for my life but can we do it my way and heres the funny thing now that im a parent i recognize in my children that they dont like it to wait on my timing they dont like to wait they dont like to chill and be patient but the thing is if they would just trust my timing they would recognize its for their good its for them to be blessed and prosperous and so you can live life frustrated anxious stressed out angry or you can rest and go god i have to trust in your timing just trust his timing why because itll give you peace itll give you rest and it will help you to remove all disappointment and hurt and bitterness from your heart because youll know actually gods in control of my life why didnt god just tell you everything thats gonna happen in your life right up front well i think there are two or three reasons first it would overwhelm you probably scare you to death but the real reason god doesnt announce his timetable to you is he wants you to trust him he says just live one day at a time trust me i im a good god im a loving god everything i do in your life is for love but you just got to trust me in acts chapter in the bible the bible says this jesus said in verse you dont get to know the time timing is the fathers business so youre just not ever going to know stuff in advance you dont know whats going to happen tomorrow in your life much less the rest of your life god does not tell us the details in advance he has a timetable for your life but he doesnt tell you the details in advance if you could understand why god does everything god does youd be god gods timing isnt good its perfect because he knows all the details he knows past present future he knows what we need what we want whats the wisest thing to do you can never go wrong waiting upon gods timing if im going to wait upon god ive got to trust him because my waiting is saying im trusting you god that your timing is better than mine you know what i do not know your time is always right and so im going to trust you and im going to wait till you give me permission to go there ill do this i have that or buy the other it isnt that gods trying to deprive us of anything he only wants what is best for us so it takes faith and what i mean by that is simply this am i willing to trust god for his timing before i make a decision just imagine how amazing life would be if we could trust god all the time in every thing all the time in every thing and trusting god means that we stop trying to make things happen ourselves and we wait on god how many love waiting we wait on god its a painful word even to say it and god doesnt do it when wed like him to or the way wed like him to but i can promise you today if you will keep your eyes on god and trust him to be your recompense and to be your reward and to be your vindicator you will get double blessings for your former trouble trusting him doesnt mean im gonna get what i want when i want it trusting him says i believe that when the timing is right god will provide what im asking him for you know broken hearts do mend bodies do healdisappointment turns into new dreams and the end of one thing can open the door for something new if we will just put our trust in god you know what if youre still here on the planet gods got a plan for you it seems to you like gods forgotten all about you well he hasnt he hears you and he sees you can i tell you today that youre not invisible god knows exactly where youre at and he knows exactly whats going on in your life and he knows exactly how much you can take and how much you cant take and he may not be early but he wont be late gods timing is always perfect do i believe that he has our best interest at heart if i believe that im going to wait but watch this somebody says i dont have any time to waste you never waste time waiting on god never you always find out that his timing is always the right time lets start in matthew jesus is speaking he said i tell you do not worry about your life what youll eat or drink or about your body what youll wear who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life and why do you worry about clothes oh you have little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own and then in philippians do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving presents your request to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus jesus said very plainly very repetitively do not worry im of the opinion if jesus says not to do something he has our best interest at heart hes not being meddlesome hes not trying to limit us hes concerned about our wellbeing and weve missed something something has eluded us we have tolerated something in our lives in our thoughts in our emotions weve tolerated something allowed it to flourish that in reality is destructive that jesus has said dont do that that we are so twisted and tied up and and melting down in our own worries and problems and we forget that we have a heavenly father right there saying do you want my help and we just got to say i want your help and trust that he can do what he needs to do let him do the work that needs to be done look if youre counting on yourself to solve all of your problems then of course youre worried and stressed out it doesnt matter how strong or wise or capable how charismatic you are it doesnt matter how much wealth or influence you have you are not designed to be able to take on everything and handle everything you will have more problems come at you than what you are capable of handling when you carry the responsibility of everything then you have to do everything you have to find the solutions you have to choose the right direction you have to power through problems you have to plan for the future make adjustments you have to do all of it at the speed of life yeah youre stressed out youre worried of course but god does not want you to do it on your own he wants you to recognize that he is there to lead you to walk you through to guide you through every step of the way and and heres the deal he doesnt want to just give you every resource that you need to get through your problems he wants to be what you need in every situation its amazing the problems that are solved the moment that you decide to trust god in everything because when you trust god you dont have to try to figure anything out anymore as you lean on him then you take the pressure off of yourself because you dont have to try to figure stuff out you dont have to try to change things that youve already tried a million times to change and the more you try to change the more frustrated it makes you because you can just finally say well god im trusting you with this and if you cant change it then i guess it dont need to be changed the only way you can learn to stop worrying and stop trying to figure things out and stop being jealous of what other people have and is i just honestly think that in addition to studying the word i think that we just have to try it our way long enough to finally just get worn out enough to just say okay god i surrendered do you know the beginning you know the end and everything in between you know every flaw that i have every fault that i have you know every weakness that i have as well as my strengths i surrendered so many times ive just said god i dont know what to do god im overwhelmed or god im in over my head and you know ive said this many times god help please it doesnt have to be long it doesnt have to be eloquent i dont have to have the answers or the solutions i just need to go to the one who does have the answers hey have you ever been on an emotional roller coaster i i mean youre just up youre down youre this way and you know what god says ill take care of that you ever go to bed thinking about it wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it in the morning you get up youre thinking about it man it has captured your thinking god says ill take your emotion and your thinking through christ jesus first peter says cast all your cares on him because he cares for you and what that means is that we take all of our problems and our worries and we choose to place it in gods hands and say i trust that you will handle the outcome are you confident that you can take your problems and your worries and place it in gods hands and that he can handle everything worry is the anticipation of the negative theres a relationship between faith and worry its in verse faith diminishes as worry flourishes or as your faith flourishes your worry will diminish worry is the negative expression of what faith in god is one of them would be i dont want jesus to ever look at me and use my name and person of little faith in the same sentence do you i want to be a man of faith where are you saying i dont think god can handle this so im going to pick it up and im going to invest emotional energy in my thoughts and my anxiety im not going to change the outcome a bit jesus said you cant add one hour to your life god can add years god has the best solution for all of our problems he sees and knows everything he sees the future he understands every angle of what is going on in your life right now he understands how people are viewing it and perceiving it he sees the best solution to your problems hes incredibly wise when i worry i am basically saying i am afraid that my life is not going to be that i the way that i wanted to but when i trust that god has the best solution i am saying god i i believe that you have the best way for me even if its not the path that i chose or that i came up with and we can trust that if we follow god and if we trust him he will give us every resource that we need every step of the way and that at the end he can turn that into something wonderful and beautiful and let me tell you if you have someone who loves you enough and who is strong enough and who has the best solution what do you have to worry about see the reason that worry exists so often is because we just think its normal its not normal its common but its not normal it doesnt have to be in our life and its its robbing us of god its robbing us of our family it distracts me from god and people it robs me of my joy and it exists because i allow it to exist listen to what im saying worry exists and anxiety exists because we allow it we are in complete control of our lives god would never command us to do something that we dont have the ability to do worry is a choice and trust is a choice you cant do both at the same time you have to choose to put your trust in god put the full weight of your problems and your life and your future into his hands and let him carry it worry and anxiety means the devil has implanted something in your life thats just sitting there intimidating you and because of that you cant focus on god and the people that you love and thats the greatest problem with worry and anxiety it robs you of your ability to worship to love the people that you love so its an enemy the root of all fear worry and anxiety is an orphan spirit because orphans are on their own and they have to take care of their own problems and the devil wants you to feel as though that youre on your own and you have to solve your own problems you have the best father in the universe stop grieving over the father you didnt have and start rejoicing that you have the best father in the universe and he loves helping you process anything in your life nothing is too small nothing is too large he just enjoys the ride he just enjoys the relationship and as were sitting here obsessing about something what it means is were wasting the relationship he does see your problems and he wants to help you gods love is for you is so immense and that means that you can come to him with anything and everything we dont have to lead lives that are defined by worry and anxiety and fear doesnt mean those things wont come and they may even come with justification but jesus said we dont have to worry about them he is my provider he is my protector he is my promoter he is the person that i long for in every relationship he is the place that i look to to find home he is my professor to reveal beautiful new things to me he is everything that i need and everything that i long for when i go to him the key to peace is not being able to solve every problem the key to peace is resting in who god is when we give god control there is a beautiful promise that he will never leave or forsake you man we can walk in that path in that promise towards peace he doesnt want you to be overwhelmed with worry and problems he wants you to be overwhelmed with his love for you and you may be saying look you dont understand how many problems i have how many issues and how much ive gone through well you know what god says no matter what you have i want to take all of your problems all of your worries all of your failures all of your sin all of your brokenness give it to me because i can handle it and the truth is only i can handle it times the bible says fear not thats a fear not for every day of the year fear paralyzes it makes you spiritually immobile fear produces pain when there is no hurt fear binds without cords fear hinders what hell cant halt fear binds your friend and loses your enemy what faith does to god fear does to the devil fear sees obstacles not opportunities fear is a magnet to call in everything opposite of what god wants to do in your life thats why job said the thing that i feared the most has come upon me when you enter into a life of fear you attract the thing that you hate we do not have to fear because when god is near we dont have to live a life tormented with fear to zachariah the message was fear not your prayers have been heard to mary the message was fear not mary dont be afraid because you have found divine favor with god to the shepherds the message was fear not exceeding great joy is coming in your future and to the message to joseph was fear not what is happening in your life is being birthed by the holy spirit himself fear not because your prayers have been heard fear not because you have obtained the divine favor of god upon your life fear not because exceeding joy is coming in your future and fear not because what god is doing is supernaturally birthing something in and through you by the power of the holy spirit great joy is coming dont rejoice about just what youve got rejoice about what you got rid of and im here today to tell you you dont have to be afraid because your past is partined fear not because your present is powerful but dont stop there fear not because your future is promised have you forgotten that were headed to a city where the lamb is the light and there is no sorrow there is no tears there is no sickness death or dying fear not death fear not devils fear not disease fear not calamity why because he is emmanuel he emmanuel means three things hes god in us hes god with us but many of you have forgotten the third thing hes god who is for us god is not just with you and in you but somebody needs to hear this today god is for you he knows what youve done he knows who you are and he still wants you to know im not against you im with you im in you and i am for you stop thinking im trying to get you back im for you im for you the realization of the presence of the lord with us what a great comfort to have the lord say dont be afraid i am with you paul writing to the romans said if god be for us who can be against us david said im not going to fear because the lord is with me the prophet isaiah said fear not for i am with you be not dismayed for i am your god i will strengthen you i will help you yes i will uphold you by the right hand of my righteousness are you going through uncertain times right now are you troubled about the future as you seek the lord and as you commit your ways to him hes promised to be with you he said i will never leave you or forsake you lo i am with you always even to the end of the world david said i will not be afraid of what man can do to me for the lord is on my side you with david can confidently face the giants of this world who may come against you with the sword and the shield but you come against them in the name of the living god the lord is with me the lord is with me to help me the lord is with me to guide me hes with me to strengthen me hes with me to deliver me from the enemy god said my ways are not your ways my ways are beyond your finding out and in those places where we dont know we just have to trust ourselves to the wisdom of god youre wise and im just trusting you lord and i find comfort i find rest the fear and the apprehension leaves as i put it back in his hand and say well lord i am yours i know youre in control of these situations and though i dont know why yet lord i trust you and im confident that you have a plan and a purpose far beyond anything that i can see god is for you and if god is for you who cares whos against you if youre under the divine favor of god how can man stop you god can do more than i can say god can do more than i can believe god can do more than i can imagine but it has to to come in my life there has to come something where the spirit of fear gets broken off fear not that youre gonna go back to what god brought you out of fear not that youre gonna get cancer or the cancers coming back fear not that bad things are going to happen to you thats not the voice of the holy spirit fear not that your children are going to be harmed in some horrible accident heres what i feel like saying today you will have that baby you will live and not die you you are going to get married if you will wait on the lord in the timing of the lord and it will be blessed dont let fear dominate your life i rebuke fear fear not its going to be all right he has not given you the spirit of fear that attacks your mind and your body and you live wondering whats going to happen today hes not giving you a spirit of fear but as a power and of love and of a sound mind i guess what im saying is dont go to the funeral till somethings dead were bearing stuff thats not dead some of you buried your vision and your dreams and your call and its not even dead quit trying to bury things that are still alive i said fear not man enjoy your life while youre here and i i tell you i think that its time to celebrate what didnt happen a lot of things could have happened and a lot of things should have happened but here you sit by the goodness of god and i know youre thankful for all that god has done but i think when we get to heaven were going to shout over more what what didnt happen than what did happen when we get to see the full picture of how god held back the enemy and protected and didnt let us get things that we thought we had to have but god said i wont let it happen because thats not my best for you you say thank you for what didnt happen god wants us to become so grateful for what he has done and what he didnt let happen because the real antidote to panic is praise the antidote to to worry is worship and thats why every one of those people that had a fear and the angel came and said fear not because your prayers have been answered fear not because theres great joy coming in your life fear not because youre under the divine favor of god fear not because the holy spirit is moving in your life to bring to pass the thing god wants to birth through you fear not because emmanuel is in you with you and for you the way to defeat fear is to begin to magnify god magnify means you make him bigger than your fear i dont want you afraid of tomorrow i want you to lift up your head and i want you to walk in confidence knowing that your prayers have been heard knowing fear not the divine favor of god is on you,1.0
after watching this your brain will not be the same lara boyd tedxvancouver,in a classic researchbased tedx talk dr lara boyd describes how neuroplasticity gives you the power to shape the brain you,translator jessica leereviewer denise rq so how do we learn and why does some of us learn thingsmore easily than others so as i just mentionedim dr lara boyd i am a brain researcher hereat the university of british columbia these are the questions that fascinate me cheers applause so brain researchis one of the great frontiers in the understanding of human physiology and also in the considerationof what makes us who we are its an amazing timeto be a brain researcher and i would argue to you that i have the most interesting jobin the world what we know about the brainis changing at a breathtaking pace and much of what we thought we knewand understood about the brain turns out to be not true or incomplete some of these misconceptionsare more obvious than others for example we used to think that after childhood the brain did notreally could not change and it turns out that nothingcould be farther from the truth another misconception about the brain is that you only use parts of itat any given time and its silent when you do nothing well this is also untrue it turns outthat even when youre at a rest and thinking of nothingyour brain is highly active so its been advancesin technology such as mri thats allowed us to make theseand many other important discoveries and perhaps the most exciting the most interestingand transformative of these discoveries is that every time you learna new fact or skill you change your brain its something we call neuroplasticity so as little as years agowe thought that after about puberty the only changes that took placein the brain were negative the loss of brain cells with aging the result of damage like a stroke and then studies beganto show remarkable amounts of reorganization in the adult brain and the ensuing research has shown us that all of our behaviorschange our brain that these changes are not limited by age its a good news right and in factthey are taking place all the time and very importantly brain reorganization helpsto support recovery after you damage your brain the key to each of these changesis neuroplasticity so what does it look like so your brain can changein three very basic ways to support learning and the first is chemical so your brain actually functionsby transferring chemicals signals between brain cellswhat we call neurons and this triggered a seriesof actions and reactions so to support learningyour brain can increase the amount or the concentrationsof these chemical signaling thats taking place between neurons because this change can happen rapidly this supports shortterm memory or the shortterm improvementin the performance of a motor skill the second way that the braincan change to support learning is by altering its structure so during learning the brain can changethe connections between neurons here the physical structureof the brain is actually changing so this takes a bit more time these type of changes are relatedto longterm memory the longterm improvementin a motor skill these processes interactand let me give you an example of how weve all tried to learna new motor skill maybe playing the piano maybe learning to juggle youve had the experienceof getting better and better within a single session of practice and thinking i have got it and then maybe you return the next day and all those improvementsfrom the day before are lost what happened well in the shorttermyour brain was able to increase the chemical signalingbetween your neurons but for some reason those changesdid not induce the structural changes that are necessaryto support longterm memory remember thatlongterm memories take time and what you see in the short termdoes not reflect learning its these physical changes that are now going to supportlongterm memories and chemical changesthat support shortterm memories structural changes also can leadto integrated networks of brain regions that function togetherto support learning and they can also leadto certain brain regions that are importantfor very specific behaviors to change your structure or to enlarge so heres some examples of that people who read braille have larger hand sensory areasin their brain than those of us who dont your dominant hand motor regionwhich is on the left side of your brain if you are righthandedis larger than the other side and research showsthe london taxi cab drivers who actually have to memorize a mapof london to get their taxi cab license they have larger brain regions devotedto spatial or mapping memories the last way that your braincan change to support learning is by altering its function as you use a brain region it becomes more and more excitableand easy to use again and as your brain has these areasthat increase their excitability the brain shiftshow and when they are activated with learning we see that whole networks of brain activityare shifting and changing so neuroplasticity is supported by chemical by structuraland by functional changes and these are happeningacross the whole brain they can occur in isolationfrom one or another but most oftenthey take place in concert together they support learning and theyre taking place all the time i just told you reallyhow awesomely neuroplastic your brain is why cant you learn anythingyou choose to with ease why do our kids sometimes fail in school why as we agedo we tend to forget things and why dont people fully recoverfrom brain damage that is what is it that limitsand facilitates neuroplasticity and so this is what i study i study specifically how it relatesto recovery from stroke recently stroke dropped from being the third leading causeof death in the united states to be the forth leading causeof death great news right but actually it turns out that the number of peoplehaving a stroke has not declined we are just better at keepingpeople alive after a severe stroke it turns out to be very difficultto help the brain recover from stroke and frankly we have failed to developeffective rehabilitation interventions the net result of thisis that stroke is the leading cause of longterm disabilityin adults in the world individuals with stroke are younger and tending to live longerwith that disability and research from my group actually shows that the healthrelated quality of lifeof canadians with stroke has declined so clearly we need to be better at helping people recover from stroke this is an enormous societal problem and its one that we are not solving so what can be done one thing is absolutely clear the best driver of neuroplastic changein your brain is your behavior the problem is that the doseof behavior the dose of practice thats required to learnnew and relearn old motor skills is very large and how to effectively deliverthese large doses of practice is a very difficult problemits also a very expensive problem so the approachthat my research has taken is to develop therapies that primeor that prepare the brain to learn and these have included brain simulationexercise and robotics but through my researchive realized that a major limitation to the development of therapiesthat speed recovery from stroke is that patterns of neuroplasticityare highly variable from person to person as a researchervariability used to drive me crazy it makes it very difficultto use the statistics to test your data and your ideas and because of thismedical intervention studies are specifically designedto minimize variability but in my researchits becoming really clear that the most importantthe most informative data we collect is showing this variability so by studying the brainafter stroke weve learned a lot and i think these lessonsare very valuable in other areas the first lesson is that the primary driver of changein your brain is your behavior so there is no neuroplasticity drugyou can take nothing is more effective than practiceat helping you learn and the bottom lineis you have to do the work and in fact my research has shown increased difficulty increased struggleif you will during practice actually leads to both more learning and greater structural changein the brain the problem here is that neuroplastcitycan work both ways it can be positiveyou learn something new and you refine a motor skill and it also can be negative thoughyou forgot something you once knew you become addicted to drugs maybe you have chronic pain so your brain is tremendously plastic and its been shaped both structurallyand functionally by everything you do but also by everything that you dont do the second lessonweve learned about the brain is that there isno onesizefitsall approach to learning so there is no recipe for learning consider the popular beliefthat it takes hours of practice to learn and to master a new motor skill i can assure youits not quite that simple for some of us its going to take a lot more practiceand for others it may take far less so the shaping of our plastic brainsis far too unique for there to be any single interventionthats going to work for all of us this realization has forced us to considersomething call personalized medicine this is the idea that to optimize outcomes each individual requirestheir own intervention and the idea actually comesfrom cancer treatments and here it turns out that geneticsare very important in matching certain types of chemotherapywith specific forms of cancer my research is showing that thisalso applies to recovery from stroke therere certain characteristicsof brain structure and function we called biomarkers and these biomarkersare proving to be very helpful and helping us to match specific therapieswith individual patients the data from my lab suggestsits a combination of biomarkers that best predicts neuroplastic changeand patterns of recovery after stroke and thats not surprising givenhow complicated the human brain is but i also think we can considerthis concept much more broadly given the unique structureand function of each of our brains what weve learned about neuroplasticityafter stroke applies to everyone behaviors that you employin your everyday life are important each of them is changing your brain and i believe we have to consider not just personalized medicinebut personalized learning the uniquenessof your brain will affect you both as a learner and also as a teacher this idea helps us to understand why some children can thrivein tradition education settings and others dont why some of us can learn languages easily and yet others can pick upany sport and excel so when you leave this room today your brain will not be the sameas when you entered this morning and i think thats pretty amazing but each of you is going to have changedyour brain differently understanding these differences these individual patternsthis variability and change is going to enablethe next great advance in neuroscience its going to allow us to developnew and more effective interventions and allow for matchesbetween learners and teachers and patients and interventions and this does not just applythe recovery from stroke it applies to each of us as a parentas a teacher as a manager and also because you areat tedx today as a lifelong learner study how and what you learn best repeat those behaviorsthat are healthy for your brain and break those behaviorsand habits that are not practice learning is about doing the workthat your brain requires so the best strategiesare going to vary between individuals you know what theyre even goingto vary within individuals so for you learning musicmay come very easily but learning to snowboard much harder i hope that you leave today with a new appreciationof how magnificent your brain is you and your plastic brain are constantlybeing shaped by the world around you understand that everything you do everything you encounter and everythingyou experience is changing your brain and that can be for betterbut it can also be for worse so when you leave todaygo out and build the brain you want thank you very much applause,1.0
billy graham the speech that will change your life forever inspirational amp motivational video,jesus came to seek and save the lost he came to rescue sinners jesus calls all who are weary and burdened to come to him,millions are crying what can i do to be saved from the pressures of life the pressures are just so great we have great technology to save time but we have less time than ever escapism is a subconscious mechanism to escape reality job said my days are spent without hope isaiah the prophet said even the youths shall faint and be weary cain who had killed abel had a terrible guilt in his life and he said my burden is greater than i can bear job who suffered so much in the bible wanted to die thousands of people are suffering from some sort of mental illness were called the tormented generation the tensions in the home problems at work health problems making ends meet we want to scream at life we want to escape from life the psalmist said and i said old that i had the wings like a dove for then i would fly away and be at rest have you said that id like to just fly away from my problem get away from it and have rest the psalmist longing to escape has become the cry of the world today but that doesnt seem to be any way out for you to those people jesus said im the way out jesus said im the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me in the sight of god man is an individual and god looks upon you as an individual that he loves he has the hairs of your head numbered he sees the sparrow fall he loves you hes interested in you and he wants you to talk to him and tell what your problems are and he will help you he loves you so much that he died on the cross for you and shed his blood for you and if you repent of your sins and receive him into your heart youll be saved youll go to heaven you dont have to straighten out your life first you dont have to go home and do something good in order to find christ you do that after youve come to christ we dont have to make ourselves well before going to a doctor he sees sick people he doesnt see well people jesus was called the great physician he said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick and were all sinners so are you the blind man came to jesus just as he was the leper came just as he was you can come to christ tonight just as you are you dont have to go and clean up anything you dont have to go change clothes and put on your sunday best just come as you are and say lord i am just a person in need of christ i need to know that i know christ what do i have to do to believe you have to become as a little child the bible says all the way through the new testament that we enter the kingdom of god by faith therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ in ephesians it says for by grace are you saved through faith now grace means something you dont earn you dont work for it you cant work your way to heaven you cant get good enough to get the heaven the word believe implies commitment surrender you believe in the person of christ and that word believe means that you commit your life to him youre not trusting anything for your future the little boy that i heard about he said you know this life is short but from what ive heard eternity is awfully long and said we better spend our time getting ready for eternity because we never know what the next hour is going to bring forth what the next day is going to bring forth now is to accepted time today is the day of salvation come while you can,1.0
the power of prayer connect with god inspirational amp motivational video,we should never underestimate the power of prayer for our loving god hears our pleas the power of prayer is immense,there is nothing but nothing more powerful than prayer and prayer is not a desirable extra in the christian life its commanded by god to be essential in everything we do god says heres my command i want you to talk to me about everything how good is your prayer life do we understand were gonna talk to god the architect the most powerful creator of everything in the universe and he says come and talk to me tell me what you want no one has power with god who doesnt pray and the question is were living in a society that has got us boundary by all these demands of things we think we got to do and the question is do you pray it is the most powerful thing in the universe nothing can take the place of prayer it doesnt matter whether youve been saved fifty years five years or five minutes god says come to my throne room and talk to me jesus prayed he lived the life of prayer he didnt just teach about prayer he didnt just sing about prayer and agree with prayer nod at prayer but he prayed the savior the son of god god in the flesh prayed if jesus had to pray how much more do you and i need to pray one of the most amazing things in all the scriptures is how much time jesus took out for prayer he only had three years of public ministry yet jesus was never in so big a rush but what he had time to spend hours in prayer he prayed before every difficult task confronting him he prayed with regularity not a day began are closed on which he did not unfold his soul before his father the scripture says pray without ceasing this should be the motto of every true follower of jesus christ never stop praying no matter how dark and hopeless your case may seem with god nothing shall be impossible no task is to artists no problem too difficult no burden too heavy for his love i believe sometimes jesus would pray im disappointed im hurt im betrayed but the greater horror is to be separated from the father so the trials that im going through will not make me separate from you theyll actually make me be one more with you and what you have to do is get that attitude that i am not going to allow the stuff thats coming in my life and hitting my family or whatever it is youre dealing with i will not allow it to cause the horrors of separation from the father if anything is gonna make me pray more than ive ever prayed before more people have quit praying because of disappointments in prayer than anything else ive had people say to me pastor i dont pray i asked for this and god didnt do it and i say well someday you may look back and be thankful god didnt do it prayer is not getting mans will done in heaven prayer is getting gods will done on earth prayer is powerful jesus prayed and so must you youre going to be used by god if you pray youre going to be anointed if you pray youre gonna have wisdom if you pray youre gonna have the favor of god on your life if you pray youre gonna have doors that open youre gonna have all that you need financially if you pray everything that you need in this life god will supply but you get on your knees and you learn how to pray and you can pray anything in heaven down to earth you and i are what our prayers are our christian life cannot be divorced from our prayer life if our prayer life is weak our christian life is weak the devil will see to it and the flesh will see to it that you and i dont feel like praying solving of every problem the meeting of every need the fighting of every battle the accomplishment of every purpose is all wrapped up and praying so when i wake up in the morning i have a choice to make today do i want god to be in my life today the question is do i want his assistance when i dont pray what im saying in effect is i dont need you im not praying about my finances because i dont need you my finances im not praying about my marriage because i dont need you in my marriage im not praying about direction because i can find my own direction and so prayer is says this beautiful beautiful thing that god absolutely loves i need you i need you lord in my life and prayer says i choose you as my shepherd i choose to allow you into my life i need you in my life today and he leads those who will follow and so we have to understand that prayer means im inviting you im inviting you into my marriage im inviting you into my finances im inviting you into my decisionmaking im inviting you into my home and god says a hundred percent of time ill come im just waiting for the invitation it is impossible to know a person you dont talk to and prayer is not a monologue its a dialogue how do you how are you gonna know god if you dont talk to him and obviously we know god through his word he is his word thats obvious but the voice of god everyday is circumstantial he wants to talk to us about where we are right now and so i pray to know god he wants time with you see for for a lot of my christian life early christian life i just didnt feel like god really loved me i felt like he was mad at me all the time because i was always doing dumb stuff you know and arent you glad that gods throne is a throne of grace that we can go boldly to the throne of grace in the midst of our problems in difficulties and jump in daddys lap and talk to daddy and that we dont have to deserve to talk to daddy because daddy just loves us because were his you dont have to deserve the presence of god jesus died so that you could get into the presence of god and not be perfect our perfection is in the blood of jesus not our good deeds and so every day i need him when i need him the most i deserve him the least i dont have to get my act together so i can get into the presence of god i cant get my act together til i get into the presence of god and the blood of jesus bought my way into the presence of god in the midst of all my difficulties its not about deserving we dont deserve anything but we get everything because god loves us so much he wants to talk to you our relationship with god is not who can run the fastest our relationship with god is about a daily walking with him its daily praying its daily reading the word its daily seeking him this is the key its a consistency of walking with god talking with god the beautiful thing about prayer is when we pray and commune with god we dont have to climb the heights to get to heaven god comes down to where we live the beautiful thing about prayer is god doesnt expect you to ascend up but if you will pray he will come to where you are the moment that we make that decision and we begin to talk to him in prayer god says i will find you i dont care where you are if you will pray and talk to me i will find you it doesnt matter where you are you pray and hell come to where you are and ill talk with you and ill communion with you ill ease your burden ill lift your worries ill unlock you and unshackle you from fear and torment if youll just come meet with me in prayer ill fill you with confidence and courage you wont be afraid you you wont listen to the voice of the serpent in the garden more than my voice if you will pray and talk to me ill come where you are and ill make that place a refreshing in your life oh what needless cares we carry all because we do not pray all because we do not seek gods face because we worry and we dont pray when youre lonely pray when youre desperate pray when youve been disappointed pray when youre hurting when youre bitter when you dont understand pray let your prayers match your problems my number one priority is connecting with god thats my number one priority all of that other stuff will be alright if i connect with god,1.0
trust god hour powerful christian motivation inspirational amp motivational video,god is with you and has everything under control so when you are feeling overwhelmed remember to trust god support,we can trust god in any circumstance we encounter with the assurance found in these three words gods got this we can we can overcome we can have victory we can believe in deliverance we can believe in healing we can believe that we can overcome in any situation as long as we know gods got this is there anything that i ever go through that god dont know about the answer is a resounding no is there any situation i ever find myself in that gods not aware of the answer is a resounding no is there any sickness that god cant heal me of the answers a resounding no is there any situation that my marriage or my family or my finances can find ourselves in that god cant fix and the answer is a resounding no is anything too hard for god no as believers as children of god we know its going to be okay as long as we keep our eyes fixed on jesus christ now if youre looking to the world right now for help youre depressed and there is nothing too hard for thee and there is nothing thats too hard for thee is there anything too hard for me whats the answer to that question that gods asking us no nothing too hard for him say it again gods got this we all have things that come against us its easy to live up tight wondering how its going to work out what if the medical report isnt good what if my finances dont get better what if my child doesnt get accepted in that school weve tried to figure it out weve done our best but we dont see anything changing if were not careful well live worried discouraged not expecting it to get better but theres a simple phrase you have to keep down in your spirit gods got this hes on the throne he sees whats happening he already has the solution you dont have to figure it out there may not be a logical answer in the natural you dont see a way thats okay we serve a supernatural god he has ways to do it weve never thought of instead of trying to force it to happen living up tight you have to let go and let god when you turn it over to him and say god i know youve got this i know youre in control not only will you feel the heaviness the weight lift off of you but god will make things happen that you couldnt make happen you have many problems you have many challenges you have many questions you have many struggles you need to know that you have a mighty god because when you face mighty problems you need to know that god who will help you face them is up to the task and he is up to the task right now my friend for god so loved the world he has never messed up he has never struggled and he is not messing up now and he is not struggling now he will help us he will help us really what we need to do during these seasons is focus less on the muscle of mankind and more on the muscle of god reach up and youll see that our god has got this in psalm chapter and verse number one that psalmist david wrote god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble ive told you this before but it bears repeating the only time and place in your entire bible that god promises to be a present help is when were in trouble he said im going to be a very present help im not going to be a casually present help im not going to be a spotty present help im not going to be here and there here a little there little present help he said im going to be a very present help in the time of trouble god is not just with you on the mountaintops hes with you in the valleys when youre going through things he knows what youre up against the scripture says god is concerned about what concerns you a sparrow doesnt fall to the ground without god knowing about it how much more is god concerned about whats happening in your life trust him live from a place of peace this is a decision we have to make on a daily basis because every day theres something to worry about theres some reason to get upset all through the day keep this phrase close to your heart gods got this hes concerned about me hes working in my life hes bigger than my enemies hes lining up the right people hes arranging things in my favor that attitude of faith is what allows god to do amazing things do you know why and how the shepherd boy david was able to prevail over the warrior giant goliath very simple david didnt compare himself to the giant he compared the giant to god we need to quit comparing ourselves to our troubles quit comparing ourselves to our pain and our pressure and the things we think we cant do anything about their giants in our lives and instead of trying to figure out what can i do about it do i have enough money do i have enough clout do i have enough friends is there any way i can solve this and when you look at it through that eye youre comparing david to goliath but david was smart enough to say you come to me with sword and spear but i come to you in the name of the lord of hosts and the bible said david ran right toward him and let the rock go and the giant come down he compared the giant to his god what youre facing may be bigger stronger more powerful but when you refuse to worry when you refuse to live stressed out instead you stay in peace thanking god that hes fighting your battles knowing that hes in control you are showing god by your actions that youre trusting him we worry too much we worry about all sorts of things dont we we worry about things we cant even change we worry until were a nervous wreck we worry ourselves into high blood pressure we worry ourselves into a stroke or a heart attack we worry ourselves into ulcers we worry until we become absolutely miserable people the kind of people nobody wants to be around we worry when it would be easier to trust god is something weighing you down today are you worried about a situation frustrated by what didnt work out or maybe down on yourself because youre not where you thought you would be god is saying to you ive got this its not a surprise to me i have new beginnings i have healing i have breakthroughs im asking you to change your perspective switch over into faith that situation at work that youre worried about gods got it im asking you to quit worrying about what youre facing quit losing sleep over that child thats not doing right quit being upset because somebody did you wrong your dream hasnt come to pass yet can i tell you gods got this i like what corey ten boon the famous jewish holocaust survivor said she said worry does not empty tomorrow of its troubles it empties today of its strength your worry dont change tomorrow your worry doesnt change next week your worry isnt going to change your situation your worry isnt going to help you make more money on the job its not going to fix your car its not going to fix the house its not going to keep it from raining tomorrow all the time youre worrying about whether or not itll rain tomorrow youre missing todays sun life is too short for you to live your life every day worrying about something that might happen worrying about what somebody has said or what somebody has done life is too short to spend it worrying life is too short for you to allow yourself to constantly all be all worked up about something life is too short to go around miserable life is too short for you to make everybody around you miserable life is too short to harbor grudges life is too short to hate quit worrying about stuff that hadnt happened yet its a proven fact that percent of the things we worry about never happen quit worrying about what can go wrong and get excited about what can go right it doesnt take any more effort to believe something bads going to happen than it does to believe something good is going to happen no more effort and by the way theyre really both faith you can either have faith that something good is going to happen or you can have faith something bad is going to happen either one is youve got faith i choose to have faith gods going to do something good i said i choose to have faith gods going to do something good quit worrying about the future as children of god we dont know what the future holds but we know who holds the future quit worrying about the future put it in the hands of god thats where it belongs anyway sometimes were trying to play god were trying to make our boss promote us make ourselves get well and make the contract go through but when you take your hands off and say god i know youve got this im not going to worry about my finances im not going to live up tight because of the medical report im not going to be frustrated because i havent met the right person god i trust your timing and i trust your ways my life is in your hands god never promised that we wouldnt have difficulties but he did promise he would give us strength for every battle he would take what was meant for harm and use to our advantage you may have a good reason to worry about something in your health your finances a dream youve done everything you can doesnt look like its going to work out stay in faith god is saying ive got this im working behind the scenes im in the process of turning it around its just a matter of time before you see things change in your favor now live out of a place of peace a place of trust it may not happen the way you thought but gods ways are better than our ways god knows whats best for you hes got this and if youre in the middle of a storm right now instead of going home tonight and worry yourself sleepless go to work tomorrow feeling bad because you worried all night and didnt sleep you know what you realize in the morning after youve worried all night is that the problems still there worrying didnt fix it so im worried about my child im worried about our money im worried about jobs im worried about a car im worried about a place to live im worried about my spouse im worried you can worry worry worry worry worry and youre not going to change no kids no spouse no family no bank balance because worrying how you fix this stuff the way you get a miracle is lay the worry aside and have faith in god dont worry gods got it all in control god makes a way where there seems to be no way when youre stuck when you confuse when your backs against the wall when your marriage is struggling when your finances arent doing well when your children arent doing well when you have a health issue god makes a way where there seems to be no way where theres no way to turn theres nothing to do theres everything is lost god makes a way where there seems to be no way father god is the waymaker isaiah verse the new living translation reads i am the lord who opened a way through the waters making a dry path through the sea the red sea for his people one more isaiah verse message bible when youre in over your head ill be there with you when youre in rough waters you will not go down when youre between a rock and a hard place it wont be a dead end seems to me that there are a lot of people finding themselves between a rock and a hard place now these powerful verses state very clearly that god can make a way that he is the waymaker he is the path opener he is the trail blazer he is the road builder he makes a way when there is no way so there is no way there is no way but but he makes one or there seems to be no way and he reveals one that we couldnt see or havent seen he makes a way when it is impossible to us have you ever been between a rock and a hard place ever feel like you cant make it ever ever feel like you you cant its impossible you you cant make it yeah ive been there a few times ever feel like youre in over your head i mean the situations just too deep youre youre treading water throughout scripture one principle is always constant god can make a way when there seems to be no way there are times when life hands us situations and many are in them now with the atmosphere in our world situations in which our faith must rise and push us to keep right on going trusting that god will make a way for us to pass through the difficult times to pass through the the trying time pass through the unknown places to pass through the unknown destinations times you cant when you cant see like abel sacrificial times like noah like noah stormy times like abraham times when theres destinations before you that you cant you cant know you cant see like sarah baron times like elijah lonely times like job painful times homesick times testing times death bedtimes just plain old times when it takes faith to handle what we dont know or see or feel or hear or understand times when we have to put our faith in the waymaker if you will trust him you can find him to be the waymaker just like everyone that i just mentioned in the scripture its been my experience that god doesnt mind getting between a rock and a hard place and creating ways for his people listen to me today when i tell you that god can make a way where there is no way hold on when you are in one of those places where you say theres no way out of this theres no way through this theres nobody that can help me with this that this is the one thats going to destroy me this is the situation that is the end of me thats when god steps up and says you can put your trust in me because i can do anything the things that we think are blocking us god is going to use to bring us victory when we feel lost and we cant find our way were going to find out that god will always make a way unseen hands are working you may not see it but unseen hands are working unseen plans are are forming and unfolding you may not see it but that doesnt mean that it isnt happening hes working behind the scenes to turn things for your good to turn things around for your families to turn things around for prodigals to turn things around hes hes working behind the scenes on ways to bless you hes working behind the scenes on ways to to provide for you to open paths of connection for you hes leading others into your life you dont even know about couldnt possibly know about hes leading others into your life that will become the answers to your heart cry answers to your prayers hes blazing a path beyond the dead ends he doesnt stop when it looks like its over never has he makes away thats why hebrews teaches so emphatically keep going keep trusting keep believing dont quit well for you as a dead end to him is an entryway to a place you havent seen yet to a place of awesome victory his love will make a way for you to get there hes the waymaker he has a plan that we havent seen yet oh im confident of that theres no dead end to him and i came today to tell you hes the waymaker you may not see it but hes the waymaker you may have came in today or you may be watching today and you say i cannot see this thats okay hes behind the scene hes working and hes the waymaker hes going to anoint you to see beyond the dead end and hes going to anoint you to move into an area you didnt even know anything about god will make a way well there seems to be no way and i want to add this to it god will make a way where there seems to be no way just dont forget him when you get there when things feel hopeless they feel helpless you just need to know that god promises to make a way when you feel like every door has been shut you cant see how something is going to happen in front of you he will make a way because our god is a waymaker and he will make a way through providing a miracle hell make a way through keeping a promise or hell just shine light into the darkness of your situation god makes a way in the middle of no way israel found themselves at the red sea and god separates the waters and in the midst of impossibility israel walks through on dry ground sea separated on each side and they walk through thats a god that makes a way in the middle of no way you know when we talk about god being a miracle worker there are a lot of skeptics in the world today even within the christian community that that would say that the miracles of the bible just either never actually took place or theyre not for today but the question for all of us is is really is he still working miracles thats the question is he still the miracle worker today is god still in the miracle business can can blind eyes that have never seen miraculously still be open can god still take just a small amount of food and still multiply that food to to feed thousands can people still be miraculously healed when everything else says that theres just no way does god still intervene into human affairs in an extraordinary way and based on what i read in scripture and what ive seen with my own two eyes and what ive experienced god i want to tell you that god is still in the business of doing miracles i want you to know that today i believe that with all of my heart he is still a miracle worker over the past few years ive watched god heal relationships that seem beyond repair ive watched him heal people of cancer when doctors said it couldnt be done ive watched him provide financially for people when all hope seemed to be lost watch god provide for my family when we said theres just no way that this can happen ive watched him heal both of my boys from back injuries when the doctors looked at both of them and said its never going to happen then i watched god do it god is still in the business of doing miracles i want you to know that i want you to believe it because i believe it with everything inside of me most of us i would say we have no problem believing that god does miracles today but were not quite sure hell do them for us in order to experience a miracle sometimes you have to take a step of faith miracles are gods business obedience is mine miracles are gods business obedience is yours im still the miracle worker but youve got to take a step of faith i like what mark batterson says he says you cant expect god to do the supernatural if you arent willing to do the natural and heres the point if you want to see the miraculous sometimes you have to take a step of obedience you have to trust god you have to have faith and you have to ask you have to do what hes asking you to do even if you dont want to even if everything inside of you is screaming no that doesnt make sense some of you are believing god for a desired outcome but quite honestly what you are asking god to do for you requires a miracle to get it done you need a miracle and jesus is the miracle worker he is the miracle worker nothing is impossible for jesus to do for you luke chapter verse says for nothing will be impossible with god matthew chapter verse says but jesus looked at them and said with with man this is impossible lets say it together but with god all things are possible i love ephesians paul writes now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is in work with that doesnt work with inside of us what does that mean it just means simply god is able god is able eugene peterson says most miracles are the byproduct of a long obedience in the same direction for some of you guys are saying to you get up get up trust me move forward take a step of obedience heres another thing if jesus does a miracle miracle in your life theres always a bigger purpose involved whats the purpose it will always always always be about bringing god glory and drawing you closer to him to deepen your faith to put jesus on display listen every one of the miracles in the book of john every one of the miracles in the bible is about bringing glory to god and deepening the faith of the people involved in the miracle but heres what you need to know god will never waste your pain he will never waste your hurt he will never waste your suffering and he will never waste a miracle and heres the other thing regardless of how long youve been waiting on a miracle jesus has not forgotten about you there are no promises in gods word that says that gods going to heal every person that is suffering or every person thats paralyzed or every person that thats in pain while were here on this earth could he heal everyone in the world right now thats suffering absolutely but for whatever reason he chooses not to even though romans says we groan to be released from pain and suffering in this lifetime it wont be until we get to heaven that will be healed and be given new bodies and listen thats a tough reality to accept about gods sovereignty its especially tough if if maybe youre a child or you have a child that is suffering or someone that you love deeply and you just watch them suffer all day long however even though i dont understand why god may choose to do a miracle here but he chooses not to do a miracle over here i do know this he is compassionate he is loving he is good and hes not forgotten about anyone he is with you just as much as hes with the person that he does the miracle for just as much and listen some of you are waiting on god to do a miracle in your life listen our savior is still a miracle worker he is still a promise keeper hes not forgotten about you isaiah chapter verse says have you heard have you never heard have you never understood the lord is the everlasting god the creator of all the earth he never grows weak or weary no one can measure the depths of his understanding he gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless even youths will become weak and tired and young men will fall in exhaustion but those who trust in the lord who put their faith in the miracle worker will find new strength they will soar high in wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not faint that means that regardless of what you have been through today jesus is still a miracle worker and the question for you today is do you need a miracle gods timing is rarely our timing which is why one of the most frequent cries in the psalms is how long how long why not now god what possible reason could you have for making this protracted suffering even longer faith is at least in part the ability to trust that if you knew everything god knew and if you understood everything god understood and if you could see everything god sees youd say thats right it takes faith to believe that because our vision is so limited and our pain can seem so long but if we knew what god knew and could see what god sees we would say of course of course i see why that had to happen to him and to them and to her into that country and that people and that decision and that thing god knew what he was doing i love what the commentator victor hamilton says gods delays are not necessarily gods denials and as some of you endure what seems like a long period of gods delay delay delay know that it is not necessarily his denial when thoughts tell you its too late its never going to happen now let that go in one ear and out the other god is faithful what he promised you is still in round you may not see any sign of it every circumstance says theres no way things are happening that you cant see in the unseen realm god is moving the wrong people out of the way lining up the healing the favor the good breaks theyre already on your schedule but heres the key if you could see how it was going to happen that wouldnt take any faith god can use anything and anybody to get you where he wants to take you and so i just came to tell somebody who came in here feeling for your sorry for yourself and came in here just feeling woe is me never nothing good ever happens to me im never im always the last one higher than the first one fired im always and you and you got your little sad song that youve loved uh uh to sing i came to tell you pick up the needle put on a new song i am who god said i am time for you to quit disqualifying yourself some of us disqualify ourselves for we ever show up i serve a god who can give me a job im not technically qualified for but because im in his bloodline if he wills me to work there hes going to put me there no matter how he gets me there but sometimes your plan and gods plan are two different things oh i came to tell you you got dont worry about your plan when yours falls apart that just means it wasnt god thats all it means somebody needs to take that with you when it doesnt work out the way you thought it would work out that just means that wasnt gods way thats all it means dont get desperate dont get frustrated dont certainly dont get mad at god he didnt give you the plan you add the plan sometimes we give god our deadlines and get mad when he doesnt meet him oh but god does things in his own way his ways are not our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts and so you got to learn to walk by faith promises that youve given up on dreams youve let go of youve accepted its too late to accomplish that goal too late to break the addiction too late to have a baby that may be true looking at a normal schedule you dont see it on there but god is saying its still on my schedule i still have a way to bring it to pass i wouldnt have promised it if i wasnt going to do it now all through the day father thank you that what you started in my life youre going to finish it may seem too late for me but i know its not too late for you thank you for these unscheduled blessings blessings out of season i came to tell you your timeline is in the hand of your god he knows what he started in your life he knows where hes taking you and you gotta walk by faith and not by sight and stop getting mad at all the people around you its not their job to elevate your life god is the one who will exalt you in good time humble yourself unto the mighty hand of god in due season when the time is right he will exalt you dont ever mistake your feeling of urgency dont ever mistake your feeling of urgency for purpose from god your urgency your sense of having to do something should can deceive you into thinking that your purpose from god ive got to do this right now but heres the thing you feel urgency and i feel urgency but god does not it doesnt mean that your urgency is felt by god god may put something urgent in your life but heres the reality your urgency doesnt mean that god also feels it when we handle things ourselves and dont trust in gods timing we always make things worse right isnt that what we do we help things along we try to find a way to get the ball rolling i you know i know god spoke this but you know it seems like god needs a little help so you know lean in and get the ball rolling come up with some solutions we dont understand how god could do something but remember hes god he works in supernatural ways often using natural systems but he does things above creation is anything too hard for the lord is there anything too hard for the lord just because it seems like god is too late doesnt mean that hes not going to come through dont be fooled by the circumstances you may not see anything the odds are against you the experts say its not going to work out god controls the universe dont be impatient for him to act keep believing keep praying and every blessing that belongs to you will show up you wont have to go after it its going to come to you its going to happen at the time god has planned have you given up hope have you given up hope did god speak something to you and you look at it and say there is no physical real way that this could happen scientifically emotionally whatever theres no way this could happen this word of god that was given to me theres no way it could happen youre in the perfect place for god to show up and speak into your desolation the word that he has which is hope that his word never returns void then his purposes and his plans for you will not be thwarted he is god and when he speaks it it is so just check out the first narrative of scripture in the creation of all things he spoke it when god speaks it comes to be but we are limited by time and we look at it and we know that time matters to us it matters we are looking at time linearly i do not believe that god does god looks in from eternity time is something god created hes not subservient to it he uses it he gave us all the numerology thats in the bible the seven days being so significant six days in a rest and the whole like rhythm of the earth in its seasons god of course uses time but god is not subservient to it god is eternal he is the alpha and the omega the beginning in the end he was he is and he will be he is outside of time he is god so remind yourself that when god speaks it will come to be but it doesnt mean that it will happen tomorrow god doesnt do things on a normal schedule a normal time frame he has some unscheduled blessings for you things that are out of season out of the ordinary that shouldnt happen now the medical report says its too late the financial experts say things should be down thats when god steps in and says let me show you who i am im not limited by time im not affected by the economy im not restricted by your age your background the opposition by how long its been i control the universe when i speak wombs come back to life when i speak red seas part when i speak sicknesses leave when i speak addictions are broken marriages are restored opportunities show up remember every calling every pull into something is a journey of faith based on his timing not yours we cannot engineer a life of faith hear that church you cannot engineer a life of faithful obedience you can only live into it trust him when you dont see anything happening believe when heaven is silent hes working behind the scenes every blessing that has your name on it if you will be patient its not only going to find you its going to be much better than you think friends know this your life is purposeful but we have to wait on his perfect timing we may not understand gods timing but we can trust his character will we be courageously obedient even when we have to wait and heres the thing if you wont say yes to it youll never get to see the fulfillment of god you will have to wait in courageous obedience for the word of the lord to come to pass he works out his plans and purposes in us nothing i want i want this to be the final words you hear nothing is wasted when we trust in gods timing he is the god who says i will give you beauty for ashes i will give you the oil of joy in your time of mourning and grief only god can do that only god can redeem time spent waiting time spent hopeless god is the god who invites us to believe in his character above and beyond our circumstances nothing is wasted when we wait on our faithful gods timing to reach its fulfillment if the truth be told and we were being totally honest most of us dont like waiting particularly if were waiting for something to change or something to get better waiting can be a very frustrating experience but the worst kind of waiting of all is waiting on god when god forces you to wait for things to get better in your life for things to improve to change to reverse and nothing is happening and yet over and over and over and over and over again in the bible were told to wait on the lord the most difficult place for you to be in life is in gods waiting room in gods waiting room some of you are in gods waiting room right now what is gods waiting room when youre in a hurry for something to happen and god isnt thats gods waiting room some of you are in a hurry to graduate some of you are in a hurry to get married some of you are in a hurry to start a family some of you are in a hurry to launch a new business to to close a big deal some of you in a hurry for a big goal a big dream a big accomplishment some of you are in a hurry for all kinds of different things and god isnt we as human beings hate to wait and we especially struggle with waiting on god have you ever been in a hurry when god wasnt and your god i know youre going to come through and im praying this really godly prayer i know its your will so where are you why arent you coming through and youre in the waiting room of life and we get so impatient we want to hurry god up and we want things right now and some of you have been waiting for god to come through and youre about to give up and youre getting discouraged and you realize that gods standard time is not always running on my time and its in the waiting rooms of life we learn to trust god the most in those difficult waiting rooms of life thats where god grows us and builds our character the most through the pain of waiting we learn to trust god and without faith its impossible to please god thats when he builds our character you see while youre working on your project your goal your dream your vision gods working on you and gods much more interested in you than in what youre trying to accomplish because youre not taking your accomplishments to heaven but you are taking your character and sometimes god says yeah i intend to give you what ive promised you i intend to answer that prayer i intend to fulfill the vision but youre not ready yet i want you to grow and when youre ready then its going to happen a lot of times we think were waiting on god for something to happen like a prayer to be answered god says youre not waiting on me im waiting on you im trying to prepare you im testing your faith will you trust me but im also trying to grow you up because the blessing i want to give you so much bigger than you can handle right now youre not ready for it you cant handle it yet another thing you have to learn in life is that a delay is not a denial theres a big difference between no and not yet now immature children dont know the difference you tell a kid not yet they start crying and having a hissy fit because they think it means no they dont understand a delay is not a denial god is saying i i intend to do these things in your life that ive given you the vision the dream to do but youre just not ready yet and at the right time i will answer your prayer gods often waiting on us now why is this important because when youre in gods waiting room you fall temptation to all kinds of negative emotions you start worrying you start stressing out you get anxious you get irritable you get spiritual add you can get envious you can get jealous hey he got a promotion i didnt get the promotion that shes having a baby im not having a baby she got engaged i didnt get engaged hes starting a new business thats taken off what about mine and all these kind of negative emotions can come in to your life and then you get frustrated and then you start having a pity party so what does god want you to do when youre in the waiting room of life and because youre going to go through it many many times god is not a vending machine where you put in the prayer and then you pull the thing and you instantly get it theres always a delay the delays are by design the delays are by design to teach you to trust him and to grow up in your character hey a delay is not a denial theres a big difference between no and not yet for those of your parents you understand this theres a big difference between telling your kids no and not yet its just not time yet and a delay is not a denial we see it all through scriptures god told noah to build a boat that would save his family from a great flood but it didnt rain for years god told abraham hed be the father of a great nation but he didnt have his first child until he was years old god told moses that he would lead the people out of slavery from egypt theyd been in for over years but then god sends moses out into the desert for years to wait god gives joseph this great dream that hell save his family and his people from famine and hell be a great leader but then joseph gets sold into slavery he gets falsely accused and imprisoned and hes waiting there in prison until finally god takes him from prison and positions him second in command in all of egypt and the promise comes true king david god had king david anointed as king but he didnt really get to be king until years later even jesus christ spent his first years waiting in a carpentry shop before he started his earthly ministry see a delay is not a denial when god delays sometimes we feel forgotten psalm says how long o lord will you forget me forever you come to a point sometimes of believing that god has forgotten you dont worry its a common experience we all go through it one time or another feeling that god isnt there or at the very least hes forgotten us perhaps our problems arent important to him we imagine the psalmist encounters those very doubts in psalm chapter and verse heres what he says there why do you stand afar off oh lord why do you hide in times of trouble what you believe is that he has given up on you you may even be feeling that way right now if so please allow me to remind you that what youre contemplating is a simple impossibility god never gives up on you he never ceases to care about you and he will not abandon his work on you of which your trial is a part he even says that your name is written on the palms of his hands your very name is tattooed on the palms of gods hands it is engraved there it cannot be removed and such is gods concern for you he cannot forget you no matter what storm youre weathering now you have never left gods mind or his heart yes sometimes when god delays we feel forgotten but god never delays without a purpose he knows you he knows your heart he knows everything youre asking him for if hes not doing what you think he should do just be patient because god loves you dont forget hes got your name tattooed on his palm he knows who you are he hasnt forgotten and he never will often gods timing disappoints us you know theres something maybe something youve been praying about for a long time and you really you need an answer you know maybe youve been um praying for something really specific and you needed god to show up within a particular time frame you know its an urgent need and he doesnt when god doesnt answer when you need him to i wonder what conclusions do you come to do you think to yourself you know did i do something wrong did i ask the wrong way do you find yourself asking does god even hear my prayers so often we think when god doesnt answer in our way or in our time that its because he doesnt love us god loves you he doesnt love anybody else one grain of sand more than he loves you you know in those darkest moments of life i want you to hear jesus looking right through your fear and saying to you trust me i am right here gods timing might not have been everything you hoped for in your life but i hope you understand that you can trust the one who keeps the time clock we dont like to trust somebody elses timing why because if we lose control and so wed rather then trust god because trusting god means my goodness i actually have to trust god wed rather go listen i like the plan and purpose you have for my life but can we do it my way and heres the funny thing now that im a parent i recognize in my children that they dont like it to wait on my timing they dont like to wait they dont like to chill and be patient but the thing is if they would just trust my timing they would recognize its for their good its for them to be blessed and prosperous and so you can live life frustrated anxious stressed out angry or you can rest and go god i have to trust in your timing just trust his timing why because itll give you peace itll give you rest and it will help you to remove all disappointment and hurt and bitterness from your heart because youll know actually gods in control of my life why didnt god just tell you everything thats gonna happen in your life right up front well i think there are two or three reasons first it would overwhelm you probably scare you to death but the real reason god doesnt announce his timetable to you is he wants you to trust him he says just live one day at a time trust me i im a good god im a loving god everything i do in your life is for love but you just got to trust me in acts chapter in the bible the bible says this jesus said in verse you dont get to know the time timing is the fathers business so youre just not ever going to know stuff in advance you dont know whats going to happen tomorrow in your life much less the rest of your life god does not tell us the details in advance he has a timetable for your life but he doesnt tell you the details in advance if you could understand why god does everything god does youd be god gods timing isnt good its perfect because he knows all the details he knows past present future he knows what we need what we want whats the wisest thing to do you can never go wrong waiting upon gods timing if im going to wait upon god ive got to trust him because my waiting is saying im trusting you god that your timing is better than mine you know what i do not know your time is always right and so im going to trust you and im going to wait till you give me permission to go there or do this i have that above the ella it isnt that gods trying to deprive us of anything he only wants what is best for us so it takes faith and what i mean by that is simply this am i willing to trust god for his timing before i make a decision just imagine how amazing life would be if we could trust god all the time in every thing all the time in every thing and trusting god means that we stop trying to make things happen ourselves and we wait on god how many love waiting we wait on god its a painful word even to say it and god doesnt do it when wed like him to or the way wed like him to but i can promise you today if you will keep your eyes on god and trust him to be your recompense and to be your reward and to be your vindicator you will get double blessings for your farmer trouble trusting him doesnt mean im going to get what i want when i want it trusting him says i believe that when the timing is right god will provide what im asking him for you know broken hearts do mend bodies do healed disappointment turns into new dreams and the end of one thing can open the door for something new if we will just put our trust in god you know what if youre still here on the planet gods got a plan for you it seems to you like gods forgotten all about you well he hasnt he hears you and he sees you can i tell you today that youre not invisible god knows exactly where youre at and he knows exactly whats going on in your life and he knows exactly how much you can take and how much you cant take and he may not be early but he wont be late gods timing is always perfect do i believe that he has our best interest at heart if i believe that im going to wait but watch this somebody says i dont have any time to waste you never waste time waiting on god never you always find out that his timing is always the right time sometimes you need to get knocked down before you can really figure out what your what your fight is and how you need to fight it sometimes you need to feel the pain and sting of defeat to activate the real passion and purpose that god predestined inside of you god says in jeremiah i know the plans i have for you plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future hear me well on this day this day when you have reached the hilltop and you are deciding on on next jobs next steps careers further education you would rather find purpose than a job or career purpose crosses disciplines purpose is an essential element of you it is the reason you are on the planet at this particular time in history your very existence is wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill whatever you choose for a career path remember the struggles along the way are only meant to shape you for your purpose when god has something for you it doesnt matter who stands against it if its meant for you god will move someone is holding you back away from a door and put someone there who will open it for you i dont know what your future is but if youre willing to take the harder way the more complicated one the one with more failures at first their successes the one that has ultimately proven to have more meaning more victory more glory then you will not regret it press on with pride and press on with purpose and appreciate what god has brought you through,1.0
be anxious for nothing overcoming anxiety amp worry inspirational amp motivational video,philippians encourages us to be anxious for nothing the presence of anxiety is unavoidable but the prison of anxiety is,its in the morning and you cannot sleep you roll from one side to the other you pound your pillow nothing helps everyone else sleeps but not you and so its in the morning it becomes and you still havent slept and anxiety begins to have its way with you another hour passes you cover your head with a pillow you feel like crying what a mess what does all this anxiety mean all this insecurity all this trepidation all this worry all this restlessness what does it mean well it means simply this you are a human being youre not stupid youre not emotionally underdeveloped youre not immature your parents didnt fail you it doesnt mean you failed them and this is important it does not mean youre not a christian christians battle anxiety jesus did in the garden of gethsemane on the night before his crucifixion he prayed for the cup of suffering to be taken away for him and he prayed with such ferocity that that the capillaries burst and rivolets of of crimson rolled down his face jesus battled anxiety he faced fears but he fought through his fears and surrendered them to god and fulfilled his mission and anxiety did not win and such is gods plan for you anxiety comes with life but it doesnt have to dominate your life gods plan for you is not a life that is drenched in anxiety it is his will that you and i learn to live a life that is characterized by calm and not chaos by peace and not panic you ever felt nearly swamped in your life like im still showing up but barely im making it and im smiling but nobody knows whats really behind this smile the things i think about some days i just want to run away from it all i want to suggest something to you today about the storms of anxiety in your life and the waves and the winds that are blowing in your life because man the winds will blow they will blow absolutely and the waves will break and they will crash no doubt about it there are some things that youre afraid of that make no sense from heavens perspective there are some things that are causing you to shut down theyre paralyzing you that are senseless when you put it in the context of who god is in you and what you mean to him and he says i want you to train your your heart to be anxious for nothing if youre following after gods purpose you got no reason to ever be anxious be anxious for nothing how can some can somebody really live a life in which theyre anxious for nothing do not let yourself be caught in a state of perpetual anxiety thats what hes saying its impossible to lead a life free of anxiety but we can discover a life that is void of perpetual anxiety anxiety comes with life but it does not have to dominate our lives you see anxiety depression and unhappiness they all come from a sense of powerlessness they all come from a sense of powerlessness so when youre powerless you feel anxious when youre powerless you feel depressed when youre powerless you feel unhappy so the the idea that that youre powerless over your debts powerless over the sentence powerless over the battle that somehow its up to you to try to make it happen that will bring you sadness it will bring you anxiety it will bring you so we only get anxious about something because were not certain about what the outcome is going to be why would you be anxious about something youre sure about you know when youre rooting for your favorite team when its live and its happening and theyre and the game is really close and its down to the last minute you get anxious about it its just an example that that just shows how our emotions operate you understand the anxiety when you when when its close and when its on the edge because youre not sure but let me ask you something if you already know and if youre watching you would have no anxiety why because you already know the outcome right see you have no fear and no anxiety when you know the outcome well the outcome of whatever your need is is my god shall supply it so when you know the outcome anxiety leaves you theres a pathway out of the valley of fret and god has used the apostle paul to sketch the map in this passage from philippians chapter verses through rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice let your gentleness be made known to all men the lord is at hand be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through christ jesus a person would be hardpressed to find a passage more practical and applicable to our day and age wouldnt you agree so what can we do paul lists here four helpful ideas for winning the war on worry and if you want to move from chaos into calm consider what paul says first celebrate celebrate gods goodness rejoice in the lord always the apostle writes with chains dangling from that roman jail cell rejoice in the lord always he writes with no penny in his pocket and perhaps the sound of the footsteps of the executioner in the hallway rejoice in the lord always he writes beneath the shadow of nero and the threat to the church he says not just rejoice in the lord always his point is dont meditate on the mess the more you stare at the problem the bigger it gets the more you stare at the problem the bigger it gets so when you have a problem lift up your eyes and rejoice in the lord the minute the anxiety comes rather than giving in to the anxiety you lift up your eyes and you rejoice in the lord this was the counsel of the psalmist he said i will lift up my eyes to the hills from whence comes my help my help comes from the lord who made heaven and earth do you see the intentionality in those words i will lift up my eyes this was the decision that the psalmist made the apostle peter is a testimony to this you remember how when the storm struck the sea of galilee he knew what foot waves could do to a fishing boat and peter cried out lord if its really you then command me to come to you on the water and jesus said come and peter left the boat and walked on the water to jesus but when peter saw the wind and the waves he became afraid and he began to what sink as long as he kept his eyes on christ he was able to do the impossible but when he saw the wind and the waves when he turned his gaze away from christ he began to sink if today you feel like youre sinking or the next time you feel like youre sinking lift up your eyes set your gaze on christ rejoice in the lord rejoice in his sovereignty is god greater than your problem has god ever faced this problem before does god have solutions youve not thought of has god got you through these types of things before does god have a good track record is god strong is god sovereign is god still on the throne is he over all see how you lift that up youre rejoicing in the lord youre lifting your mind away from the problems and youre setting your mind on the one who can solve it do not meditate on the mess so you rejoice thats what it means to rejoice in the lord oh ive got a great god ive got a wonderful father i rejoice in the lord and then the apostle says having done that youll be ready to ask god for help youve calmed yourself down now you ask god for help let your requests be made known to god you see fear triggers either despair or prayer so choose wisely god said call on me in the day of trouble jesus said ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you the path to peace is always paved with prayer thats why the devil doesnt want you to pray the path to peace is always paved with prayer the enemy satan would love to shut down your ability to pray in faith when you pray and you take a promise of god and you declare it over your life in whatever area okay the bible says to believe you have received it worry does not believe that anxiety does not believe that the cares of this world do not believe that and the enemy will attack anything that you stand in faith for and he would love even if in your everyday life for you to start worrying about things that you never worried about before when you offer a request to god do you tell god now god im just going to stay around till you get it fixed if you need my advice im going to be putting you on the clock im going to check in with you no you leave youre concern with your heavenly father and consequently where that anxiety has gone you can now place gratitude gratitude look what the apostle says he says in everything by prayer and supplication with what thanksgiving thanksgiving anxiety and gratitude cannot share the same heart test me on that try it sometime the next time youre anxious begin to make a list of things for which youre grateful because anxiety and gratitude refuse to share the same heart so you leave your concerns with him you fill your heart with gratitude and then lastly meditate on good things dont let anxious negative thoughts take over your mind you cannot control your circumstances but you can control how you think about them peace comes from a stream of thinking from a stream of thinking because you could be a christian be born again and on your way to heaven but have no peace why because of what youre thinking because of what youre meditating on because of what youre dwelling on what youre focusing on whats going through your ear you know in between your ears whats going on in your head in between your ears listen this is why so many christians fail is because theyre trying to obtain and struggling for a victory that jesus has already given you see if for example if you think about one of the things he promised he would do for you is it says my god shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory if your mind is constantly on the fact that god will supply you will have peace so you could have all the money you need and not have peace but you could you could have an empty bank account and have peace because you believe the promise that he will supply you see the peace doesnt come from the money in your account the peace comes from your thought and your mind focused on what god said he would do and your confidence that he will do it because hes done everything else that he said he would do some years ago i wrote this in a journal i read it quite often today i will live today yesterday has passed tomorrow is not yet im left with today so today i will live today relive yesterday no i will learn from it i will seek mercy for it i will take joy in it but i wont live in it the sun has set on yesterday the sun has yet to rise on tomorrow worry about the future to what gain it deserves a glance and nothing more i cant change tomorrow until tomorrow today i will live today i will face todays challenges with todays strength i will dance todays waltz with todays music i will celebrate todays opportunities with todays hope today may i laugh listen learn and love and if tomorrow comes may i do it again the next time that anxiety awakens you at in the morning would you believe what im suggesting to you and that is it is not gods will that you lead a life of perpetual anxiety that your heavenly father will help you he will help you pull out the roots of your anxiety he will help you deal with the fears that face you,1.0

and the balance the god that we serve has total control he says let there be light and in that moment of time darkness was shattered and conquered forever his son jesus christ walked upon the raging sea of galilee and he held the winds of his fist and said peace be still thats control that god is in control of planet earth and he can be absolutely in control of your life if you let him he will make a way where there seems to be in a way stop worrying and start living worry proves that you dont believe god can take care of you worry is faith in fear worry is faith in fear the two words in the new testament from the mouths of the apostles fear not fear not fear not the past why because your past has been forgiven and forgotten fear not the present i will never leave you nor forsake you joshua and be not afraid for thy god is with you wherever you go david said yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me death has been reduced to a shadow the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom should i be afraid psalms and hebrews the lord is my helper i will not fear what man can do with me fear not death the bible says i am he who was dead and behold i am alive for evermore fear not sickness because this is the book of the great physician fear not poverty for it is the lord that gives you the power to get wealth fear not other people the bible says i will make your enemies to be at peace with you you will climb the impossible mountain ill give you the ability to defeat the impossible foe shall fall at your left hand ten thousand shall fall at your right hand david said i will fear no evil why because god almighty is with me thats why worry is trust in the unpleasant worry is assurance that disaster is coming worry is believing in your personal defeat and despair worry is a polluted stream that flows through your brain that drowns hope and optimism that kills faith worry is interest paid on trouble that never happens think about that one old man said and i quote most of the trouble ive had in life never happened how many of you have worried yourself silly about something you just knew was going to be disaster and it never happened worry enters our life through thoughts but the bible teaches us to cast all of our care on god because he cares for us life is real and we never know exactly whats going to come our way but we do know god we dont have to live in fear because hes with us and hes on our side well worry sees the problem but it doesnt see god i dont think its wrong to see the problem matter of fact i think we should look at our problems squarely and then we need to tell them where they stand in relationship to god worry sees the problem but faith sees the god who can handle the problem and thats what we have to do and whatever situation youre in right now in your life whether its something with your kids or your marriage or your finances or you think youre never going to recover from your past or youre fighting with some kind of an addiction or some kind of a sin that just keeps trying to cling to you whatever it is you have to know that god is greater than any problem that you have and you have to not worry because when you pray and then you worry the worry nullifiers your prayer prayer is something you do instead of worry if we pray and then worry were saying with our mouth that were depending on god but were staying with our actions that we dont really believe that god is going to come through so were going to worry and have a backup plan just in case he doesnt we dont have to know what god is gonna do we dont have to know when hes gonna do it all we need to know is that he is and he has a plan and at the right time not our time but at the right time god will execute that plan matter of fact im gonna tell you somethings just bubbling up in my heart right now god is working in your life every single one of you god is working in your life right now in ways that you cannot feel dont see and dont understand and everything that we go through we need to lift up our voice and say god i believe youre working in my life right now im expecting something good and god is with you in your situation some of you are in very difficult situations and yet in the midst of that you have joy and peace and you have hope and only god can give us that god is with you just because you have a problem that does not mean that god has abandoned you god is with you jesus christ made the profound statements about worried that the world has ever heard in matthew the sixth chapter therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink or about your body what you will put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air for they neither sow nor reap nor gather and barns yet your heavenly father feeds them or you not of more value than which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature so why do you worry about clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spend and yet i said to you that even solomon all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these now if god so clothes the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you oh you of little faith therefore do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for after all these things the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all of these things shall be added unto you therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about its own things sufficient for the day is its own trouble simple profound god gives you what you need and im sure that many of you have things looming out there in the future that you know is going to require answers and you dont have those answers but you know what the greatest way that you can show faith in god is to refuse to worry about it refuse to think about it excessively and every time it comes to your brain just say i dont know what im gonna do but i know the god who does know what im gonna do and thats when we get over into the miracle realm with god where he can do exceedingly abundantly above and beyond all that we could ever dare to hope ask for or think many of you have got a wonderful testimony in your life of what god has done for you and god has brought you some from some places that nobody would ever thought that you could have recovered from of course i have that same testimony myself and im telling you what god is no respecter of persons his promises are not for somebody else or an elite for you they are for you he is here right now and he is taking care of your situation you dont have to worry god will do one of two things if you have a problem he will either remove the problem which is always our first choice and usually the only thing that we think we can even be remotely satisfied with he will either remove the problem our he will give you the strength the grace the ability to go through the problem now i know we dont like to going through part but im telling you if you can say god i know youll do one of two things youre either going to remove this youre going to move it youre gonna take it away or you going to give me the grace to deal with it and if we can trust god enough to leave that choice up to him because if he lets us go through it then hes got a purpose in mind theres something were going to get out of it that we need trusting god is wonderful its so wonderful to just say i dont understand this but i believe gods gonna work it out i do not understand this it hurts so bad i feel like i cant stand it but i believe that god is going to work it out some way somehow i believe that god is gonna work it out our journey with god is a very wonderful wonderful wonderful thing and im asking you today to choose boldness dont live a little bitty narrow nothing life when theres such a great big wonderful life available to you just because you wont take that chance that just maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe what you feel really is god god has not given us a spirit of fear he doesnt want us living timid weak wimpy fearful lives he wants us to be bold and courageous and strong and not afraid to try new things i think a lot of the reasons why people dont step out and try new things is they already think before they even try about all the things that might happen if they fail and i think that if you know that how much god loves you really understand how much he loves you then you can live without that fear of failure which immediately sets you free to try things if you just do the best you can when you step out then god will promote you a little bit at a time so often i think we look at the way we think it needs to be in its perfection and if we cant do that yet then we wont even step out and do anything and i can tell you my beginning was pitiful but i was following god i think that some of you are at a point in your life and i just i feel this in my heart that some of you youre facing something new maybe something in your life has come to a close and now youre facing something new and fear always comes against us when we face new things youre not the only one every time you try to make any kind of progress you can be assured that satan will try to frighten you thats the way that he keeps people from going forward courage is not the absence of fear but courage is actually forward motion in the presence of fear i dont want you to forget that youre not afraid youre not a coward because you feel fear but were cowardly when we let the fear control us rather than continuing to follow the leadership of the holy spirit god will lead us through fear and into his perfect will for our lives if you ever really want to live your life led by the holy spirit you have to understand that god doesnt even usually call people that are qualified or who feel ready to do what theyre being asked to do thats why it takes faith to do it and faith means that you step out based on whats in your heart not based on whats in your circumstances instead of being afraid of new things we should be excited about new things and i know this sounds really like kindergarten simple but honestly and truly if people would just have the courage to just follow god for their individual lives you would have an outrageously wonderful life not everybody might like what you do not everybody might approve of your choices you might not always get a lot of encouragement and handclaps when you begin but god will prove himself to you if youll be bold enough to follow god and not the crowd myself included we regularly come to places in our life and we havent been there we havent done that we have no experience with that and so we have a tendency to want to start backing off from it and just stay in our little boat of safety but gods encouraging you today to step out and be bold enough to follow the leadership of god for your life and it never ceases to amaze me what god enables a person to do if they will just step out bold faith christianity is viewed increasingly with not only skepticism but open hostility and it requires of us a bolder faith a willingness to say out loud im for jesus im for jesus i think jesus is a good thing i think hell help you its now acceptable in our culture too if you hold that worldview it is suggested openly not hinted at not nuanced its openly suggested that that somehow youre not quite up to speed with the st century that intellectually even left a little behind that your your moral development and your philosophical awareness and your worldview is is a bit jaded a bit skewed its its underdeveloped and youre a diminished person in some way it takes bold faith to be a jesus person in these days and i want to encourage you and let it be known in your circle of influence with your friends and your neighbors and your family members and your coworkers your with jesus its important they need to know people like you love jesus bold faith a faith that says on the daily basis i want to do my best to make choices that honor jesus of nazareth im for him and i would encourage you to be for him hes made my life better jesus doesnt diminish life he extends the quality of life he expands the contentment in life bold faith not critical not harsh not meanspirited but a passion for jesus that influences your life if we would go to joshua we would see that when god sent joshua to take mosess place to lead the israelites across the wilderness into the promised land he said theres only one thing that you have to do fear not and be bold god cant work through fear he works through faith fear opens the door for the enemy to work in our life and faith opens the door for god to work in our lives fear comes out of your flesh out of your circumstances out of what you think and feel but faith comes out of your heart and you have to follow your heart you have to keep your heart safe and you have to keep your heart free and if youre not following the leadership of god for you then your heart is not going to be free its going to be burdened and i believe that even if you step out to try something you believe is god and you dont make it all the way god likes that spirit of aggression and that boldness that says im gonna step out and try it im not gonna live in fear so we have a choice of facing the difficulties we face in life in one or two ways we can do it courageously or we can do it fearfully and god doesnt want his people living fearful he says i have not given you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind god wants us to be triumphant he wants us to be courageous and bold whatever we face in life and hes made promises to make it possible for us to face anything and everything and still be standing when the battle is over in difficult times dangerous times we dont look around we look were up and so we get courage strength and were willing to trust god be fearless and bold no matter what god requires of us god will change your life god is ready to give you the best the question is are you ready to trust him for it couple of scriptures just for encouragement and your ear will hear a word behind you saying this is the way walk in it when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left god is promising us now get this this is a promise to every one of us that when we step out into what we believe is gods will that he will guide us every step of the way but hes not going to give you a blueprint for the next years before you make the first move psalm the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me isiah behold god is my salvation i will trust not i feel but i will trust and not be afraid for the lord god is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation isaiah is another great promise and i man i pray this one all the time and i will go before you and level the mountains to make the crooked places straight and i will break in pieces the doors of bronze im cut asunder the bars of iron i know that everywhere that i go theres always opposition theres always a plan that the enemy has to stop the good that we want to do but i just pray this scripture that god will go before me and send his angels before me and hell prepare the way before me and prepare the hearts of the people before me and you know what if you will make a decision to stop letting other people make your decisions and to step out and try some things youll find gods destiny for your life youll find whats going to fulfill you and what youre meant to do and youre meant to be but youve got to be bold you have to be bold enough to step out and find out do we dare to dream what is a dream do you dare to dream when others say its impossible do you dare to dream when others live in doubt and despair jesus christ the author and the finisher of our faith said all things say that with me all things are possible to them who believe believe that god will do what he said he will do our god is able to overcome the limitations that others have placed on you whatever forecasts they stated for your future god can cancel it in a second if you put your faith in him our god is able to overcome the pain of your past and heal the wounds of yesterday our god is able to give you strength for today and fill you with hope for tomorrow our god is able to take all things the good the bad the pleasant the unpleasant and work them together for your good but what you have to do is believe believe that the dream that he placed in your heart is a glimpse of your destiny and then press on endure hardness god will not fail you god will give you the desires of your heart you just have to trust in him and know that he didnt bring you this far to let you down and if god has you in one hand and your destiny in the other i assure you your dream will come true dreams consider the power of a dream our dreams are the golden ladder by which we climb to heavenly places dreams are the mountain peaks of vision that we climb and look over into the promised land that god has given us dreams are the lanterns by whose light we pass safely through the darkest valley dreams are the inner flame in your soul that gives you the strength and the day of adversity to fight through the darkness until the dream comes true all great things are born in a dream art books music sermons building skyscrapers corporate empires beethoven used to wander in the woods to get his music in the theatre of his mind he heard great symphonies of sound that blessed the world james walt invented the steam engine and he cranked it up he shouted to his friends you see it today with your natural eye but years ago i saw it in my minds eye dreams are the stuff that life is made of walt disney said if you can dream it you can do it and i hope and pray that you have a dream for your life not having any kind of goals or any kind of dreams for your life its kind of a boring dull way to live dont ever stop dreaming no matter how old you are dont stop dreaming youre not too young to dream youre not too old a dream and even if youve got some shattered dreams in your life i want to encourage you to dream again dont you give up on your dream i dont care if you dont have the money you dont have the help and you dont have the family for it and you dont have the background for it and you dont have friends for it dont you give up on your dream dont you do it dont you do it dont you do it it may take you twice as long you may have to take courses and classes you may not read as fast you might not move as quick you might not have as much but dont you quite sometimes its best that you just keep your dreams to yourself because your dream is about you it is gods divine way of giving you a glimpse of your destiny it was gods way of saying that josephs one day im going to exalt you and youre going to rule and all the nations are going to bow before you that was josephs destiny that was the dream that god planted in his heart in order for that dream to become a reality joseph had to endure he endured misery and pain and a season of hell on earth that would be difficult to describe but all that he went through he was able to walk through because before it ever began god gave him a glimpse of what was to come and he walked down that long road believing that if god before him who can be against child of god i believe that he is no respecter of persons if god had a dream for jacob and god had a dream for joseph then god has a dream for you the devils job he got one mission is to make you think you aint going to make it the devil wants to keep you from your destiny thats his one job satan got one job to keep you from your destiny the devil dont ever want you to be what god created you to be if youve been dreaming about opening that business you should start the process dont try to figure out how to make a million dollars just start the process see if you make one step hell make two but he cant make his two unless you make your one dont worry about what youre going with just get started hell show you the way to go cuz he wants you to get to your destiny but he got to make sure that you want to get to your destiny first if you tell him you want to get to your destiny that god you serve he gonna show you how to do it you could believe it dont forget to pray dont be ashamed to pray and dont ever be too proud to pray because prayer prayer changes things why is it that sometimes peoples dreams dont come true you know the devil is always trying to dig some kind of a pit for us trying to pitch us in it whether its a pit of depression a pit of discouragement a pit of poverty a pit of sickness and disease he always wants us to be somewhere between besides on top where god wants us to be its kind of hard you know when youre having to wait longer than you thought you would and things are a lot harder than you thought they would be and it seems to be costing you more in your life than what you ever think that you can bear and it just keeps going on and on and on and on and on but the people who refuse to quit the people who wont give up i can tell you i promise you if you wont quit and you wont give up you will make it to the finish line you will make it to the finish line but it goes without saying that life can push you through seasons where it becomes difficult to dream is it right to hope for a better tomorrow is it fair to believe that theres a brighter day ahead this mindset is something that is contrary to what the word of god tells us we are to believe for and believed in we may indeed be in a world that is spinning in absolute financial cultural and global chaos but the bible tells us that we are not in this we are in this world we are not of it we have been told that greater is he who is in us than he who is in the world we are told that even though we may see the hardest of times we can expect the best of things because it is our god who sits upon the throne in a world of hardship he has promised to be the divine provider he has said i have a plan for you it is a plan not to harm you it is a plan to give you a hope in a future in a world of need he has said i am still the god that shall supply all of your needs according to my riches and glory in a world of chaos and confusion he said i am the prince of peace and my peace not only do i give it unto thee but it surpasses all understanding you may be in a dry season today but our god has said he would be a spring of living water for your thirsting soul you may be walking through a dark valley but the light of the world has promised that hell be right beside you and hell lead you every step of the way to the other side you may be in a world of trouble but he is a strong tower he is a shield and he is an offense in your day of adversity he said ill be the rock of your salvation ill be the glory and the lifter of your head my goodness and my mercy they shall follow you all the days of my life for even david himself declared since the lord is on my side what can man do to me child of god if you have a dream today dont give up on the dream that god gave you businessman dont quit pursuing the dream that he planted in you mother and father continued to believe for the dream that he has in store for you young person dont abandon the dream that he planted down deep in your soul because god did not bring you this far to fail he brought you this far to crown you dream a new dream and believe in a god who can never fail everyone wants a miracle but no one wants to be put in the crisis that requires a miracle the only way you really need a miracle is that you have a problem and the bigger the problem the bigger the miracle you need we like miracles but not the problems that go with them but sooner or later its going to happen to you the phone is going to ring and youre calm tranquil wellordered life is instantly going to be in a ranging storm sooner or later youre going to face a crisis beyond your power to control our god is a god who wants to perform the miraculous in your life there are times in our lives where we face something that it just seems like theres no way out we could do all the math in our mind and our mind will tell us theres nothing that can be done here maybe youre in a job and you know god wants to bless you but you look at your situation you think what god cant move here my boss doesnt like me my i cant get along with the other people at work theres theres such a ceiling in my environment its impossible for god to move in this situation other times we might say well my marriage pastor its just so bad its been so many years that its been sliding in the wrong direction i dont know that god could ever move our marriage into the position that he keeps talking about how is god gonna change these things in my life pastor ive been attacked in my body for so long the diagnosis is that its incurable nothing can be done here im not sure that god could even move i dont know what he would do and our brain starts to opt us out of gods best in our lives it says well the impossible things i dont know god still does that anymore we begin to forget the things in our past where god did perform the miraculous can you think back to a time when god did something miraculous in your life that no one could explain something happened and you got a breakthrough when there seemed to be no way there was a miracle that happened in your life that could not be explained with the mind the mind wants to get in your way it wants to say well thats impossible a lot of people believe in the bible they believe in the miracles in the bible what they dont believe is that god will do it for them and do it now thats what faith is believing that god can do it for you and do it right now there we live in a world where everyones telling you you cant pull this off what we live in a time when when people even in the church dont believe in the power of the holy spirit and what he can do sometimes we just look at the scriptures and go well yeah that was back then and you guys its its not about back then its its about always its about ever since the beginning of this book and all the way to the end the followers of god were filled with courage there was a fearlessness in them there was a confidence of my god will come through we grew up with these stories we really did and dont you remember as a kid just having this faith like god can do anything god loves to work best and shine his glory when things seemed the darkest when the israelites were in a situation hemmed in by the mountains they couldnt escape the mountains they had to sea in front of them they couldnt swim across that and the egyptians were coming in and god had positioned them there whats going on this is impossible you know what even when it looks impossible god can either blow up the mountains or he can part the sea hes gonna figure it out we just have to keep believing that no matter how impossible it looks god can still do it i dont know how hes going to come through in this financial situation but heres what i do know i know that my god will meet all of my needs according to his riches in glory i dont serve a god of the practicals i serve a god of the miracles the god of the bible is a miracle working god in the genesis of time he breathed into a handful of dirt and adam became a living soul that was a miracle he separated the day from the night he flung the glittering stars against the velvet of the night to glisten like diamonds as an eternal reminder to mankind that he is the infinite creator he set the sun ablaze and placed it in the heavens as his version of the eternal flame the infinite power of god to create is far beyond our imagination to grasp the god of this bible is a god of might and miracles hes a god of grace and glory hes a god of power and patience moses parted the red sea and walked across on dry ground with almost million people he healed the lane healed the deaf he healed the blind that my friend is miracleworking power we serve a jesus who walked around making the uncommon events and the power of god look like they were common every day he was performing a miracle you have that same spirit on the inside of you and its so rare that someone even in church gatherings so rare for someone to put their arm around you and remind you of how powerful you are how powerful your god is who dwells inside of you and what you can do you know we kind of we become more and more cowardly hes never been pleased with cowardice hes never been pleased with people who dont believe that he can come through and that he can do anything but have we lost the wonder of god do we see his might and majesty so often were blind to its presence have you ever watched the sunset or the sunrise that ball of fire thats glowing on the horizon its a staggering miracle that you really you cant wrap your mind around why should you know this because on creations morning a divine spark of glory escaped from the fingertip of almighty god it blazes in the heavens on a daily basis as gods billboard to the nations of the earth he say this is my miracle working power of the god that created heaven and earth that you can serve he is awesome he is full of wonder he is the light of the world sometimes we think of all the busyness were gonna do to help god try and do what hes doing listen take a step back and let god do what gods trying to do just put your faith that when things get impossible hes gonna unlock the impossible hes gonna show up in his glory so that we could say all these years later that was god that did that and not us people get the idea its easy for god to heal a head cold and he cant touch cancer let me take the cancer is not a challenge for god when you have the faith for it i mean you can move mountains here gods just waiting for you to uncross your fingers and start believing he wants you to see that miracle he wants to wow you and when we stop expecting and we negotiate we say well how gods gonna do that i dont know but you know what god im fine our brain tends to look at what the devils bring in and say well that might be working you know its not what i thought it was gonna be its not a wow but itll do ill settle in this situation im just gonna take what this compromise is remember this if you remember anything out of today god is not a god a compromise hes gonna bring a miracle into your life dont accept second best we get knocked down here and there and then people start telling you you cant pull it off and our faith and that risk and that courage just seems to subsid and its not right its its not good thats not thats not how we want to live why dont i believe like i used to were children of god god is still god not just when he was when we were little kids but when were when were just go man im gonna go for it gods done some amazing things throughout time as i grown my knowledge i want my courage and my boldness to grow with it not not the opposite our father which art in heaven is still jehovah rufie the lord that heals all disease his son jesus christ is still the great physician he is the balm of gilead hes the conqueror of death hell and the grave this is the word of the living god it is a twoedged sword this is the bread of life this is living water this word spoken under the anointing of the holy spirit is a divine proclamation that can move mountains and conquer diseases you are what this book says you are you can do what this book says you can do you can have what this book says you can have you can know what this book says you can know you can go where this book says you can go nothing is impossible unto you if you go in the name of the lord jesus christ this book says whatsoever you ask in my name i will do it and if that was the only verse in the bible it would make christianity the greatest faith on the planet ask and you shall receive today im asking god that she received the miracle that will turn your life around the only way youre ever gonna know your purpose for your life why youre here on this planet what on earth youre here for is a talk to your creator god who made you and b read the owners manual god has never created anything without a purpose every plant has a purpose every star has a purpose every animal has a purpose god does not create things without a reason without a purpose and if your heart is beating and youre breathing theres a purpose for your life because god never makes anything without a purpose and the very fact that youre alive makes your life meaningful that god had a reason for creating you it is in christ we find out who we are what were living for part of the overall purpose that he god is working out in everything and everyone the next verse colossians chapter verse says this everything absolutely everything got started in christ and finds its purpose in him it is in christ that we find out who we are and what were living for so you said i really got to find myself youre gonna find yourself in christ you were made by god you were made for god until you understand that your life is never gonna make sense youre gonna go through life wondering what on earth am i here for you gotta start with god god wants you to know him and love him back heres what he says in the book of hosea in the bible chapter verse god says i dont want your sacrifices i want your love this is god talking to you i dont want your offerings i want you to know me the most important thing you can know in life is that god loves you and the most important thing you can do in life is love him back first timothy chapter the bible says this some people have missed the most important thing in life they dont know god they dont know god now how do you know when you dont know god how do you know when youre disconnected from god how do you know when in that moment youre not knowing and loving god god has given us a warning sign and that goes off like a bright yellow light in your life every time you get disconnected from god and that warning sign is this worry when you worry youre acting like god doesnt exist youre acting like if its to be its up to me no its not up to you its up to god and when you when you worry youre acting like its all your responsibility that you dont have a heavenly father who loves you but there werent promises in the bible that god hasnt already agreed to take care of all your needs were always worried about what does god want me to do god what job should i have where should i go to work we should go to school what should i do were always worried about what we should do god is much more interested not in what you do but in what you become and the reason why is youre not taking your career to heaven youre not taking your car to heaven youre not taking your cash to heaven how much money you making youre not taking your china youre taking your character the only thing thats going to heaven after your years or so here on earth is you youre not taking any of your accomplishments youre not taking any of your achievements youre not taking any of your acquisitions youre not taking any of your things youve piled up stockpile them money materialism stuff like that none of thats going to heaven the only thing thats going to heaven is the person you became the man you became the woman you became the only thing youre taking to heaven is your character and god puts you on this planet to develop your character to grow up spiritually and to become like jesus christ when things happen to you the normal question you ask is the word why why is this happen why is this happening to me why is this happening now and the answer to all the why questions of life is this to make you like jesus to make you like jesus if gods gonna make you like jesus hes gonna take you through everything jesus went through and jesus wasnt spared from difficulty was there are times when jesus was lonely yes time when he was misunderstood yes were the times when jesus was disappointed by people yes were the times when he was tempted to be discouraged and give up yes were there times when whos just tempted yes and if god let his own son go through all that dont you think hes gonna let you go through it too yes why because hes more interested in your character than your comfort this is not the comfort side of life the comforts gonna come in eternity comforts gonna come in heaven this is the classroom side of life where you were to learn and some things you only learn through difficulty if you got everything you want everything went your way you had no problems you would be a spoiled brat selfcentered brat and the whole goal of life is learning unselfishness its not about you its about learning to love god and learning to love other people and thats where fulfillment and joy and purpose comes from you know those problems you dont like in your life every problem has a purpose and that purpose is to make you like jesus there is no situation in your life you cannot grow from if youll just trust jesus and if youll just learn to respond in the right way god knows that youve been frustrated with your life he knows your hurts he knows your sadness he knows your fears he knows the turmoil that goes inside of you he knows the loneliness you feel when you put your head down on the pillow at night he knows the insecurities that you feel that you dont want to admit to anybody else he knows all of that he knows every part of you youre not gonna surprise him by the hidden part of your life or the life that youre leading he knows you he is a loving father he is the father that cares for you more than for you can ever imagine and a father wants to guide his children before you were born the bible says i knew you before you in your mothers wombs i know the hairs on your head your names are written on the palms of my hand i have plans for you plans for welfare and not for evil sometimes you may feel just too insignificant when god called moses to free the israelites moses protested that he could not speak publicly when sarah was promised a son she protested that she was too old when jeremiah was told to prophesy he protested that he was too young when god sent gideon to fight the midianites gideon protested that the family was insignificant when samuel anointed saul with oil saul protested that his tribe was too small and when samuel anointed david jesse protested that david was the youngest of his eight sons and even mary when she was promised that she would carry the messiah protested that she was a virgin he sees us not as we are but as we will become no man will ever love you no woman will ever love you like your creator does like jesus christ does and to go entirely through your entire life disconnected from your creator who loves you that much makes no sense at all if somebody was willing to die for you wouldnt you want to know about it if somebody loved you so much they died for you wouldnt you want to know them somebody did die for you his name is jesus christ and he died for you to pay for all the things youve done wrong so you could live a life a purpose and my plea to you as your pastors do not waste your life decide right now that for the rest of your life youre gonna give the best of your life not to your girlfriend not to your boyfriend not to your job not to something else but did god and this kingdom become what god made you to be the man god made you to be the woman god made you to be jesus christ commanded the church to fear not fear is mentioned in the bible over times its no small subject in the word of god from genesis to revelation abraham to john on the isle of patmos we hear that commandment given over and over fear not that command was given to abraham that command was given to israel that command was given to moses it was given to david who ran from saul for years who lived in caves before he became a king that command was given to daniel who was going into the lions den that command was given to the city of jerusalem the angel gabriel gave that message to mary to peter who was sinkin in the swirling tide of the sea of galilee to paul who had been on a ship for days and it looked like all would be lost the angel of the lord appeared and said fear not fear not fear not every time you see in the bible fear not which is all over the bible fear not for i am with you fear not for i am with you fear not for i am with you fear not for i will never leave you nor forsake you thats the main reason that the bible gives for us not fearing is to know that god is with us and that if hes with us he loves us and he will take care of us but god says over and over fear not for i am with you remember not talking about not having the feeling of fear were talking about not letting it stop you we cant live our lives in fear and dread of whats going on and whats going to happen satan wants us to shrink back in fear and live little tiny useless lives but god wants us to be brave and bold do not be afraid it is said in different ways different variations but its basically the same thing fear not do not be afraid be fearless fear ye not over and over and over again in different ways god wants to say to us the exact same thing in fact it is so critical and so important to him that he gets to the new testament and paul writes a letter to a young man named timothy and he says tim this is what you need to know that he has not given us a spirit of fear he says of all the important things timothy that you need to know in your life and in this ministry that god is sending you through to as you go through things in this journey of life that you will inevitably go through he says would you remember that what our god does not give is fear he gives power and love and a sound mind fear is a real thief in our lives isaiah says fear not theres nothing to fear well isnt that interesting for i am with you thats the only answer he gives because im with you and so if we really know who the lord is im not talking about just going to church but i mean if you really know who the lord is then we dont have to know what hes going to do we dont have to know when hes going to do it we dont have to know what the way is going to be we just say lord i know youre with me and therefore i can do what i need to do because when fear causes you to stop and to do nothing its the master spirit i believe that the enemy uses to try to keep us from fulfilling our destiny and so he tells us theres no way he says you you got to be afraid of this you know if you failed before then you got to be afraid that youre gonna fail again but god says fear not for i am with you i love that theres nothing to fear do not look around you in terror and be dismayed you know its one of our problems we look around us too much instead of looking up the more you stare at your problems the more you rehearse your problems the bigger theyre gonna get every time you go through something difficult it makes you a little bit stronger just a little bit stronger fear is a fact of life fear of the future fear of danger fear of the past others fear the loss of their job the loss of your health theres a sudden and unexplainable pain and it brings fear to your mind some of you fear the loss of position the loss of selfesteem you fear failure you fear the criticism of other people you fear exposure you fear being disliked theres a fear of death theres the fear of the unknown the era of human history is the era of anxiety and fear when the fear knocks at your door send faith to answer and no one will be there isiah wrote i will trust and i will not be afraid we have to understand that fear first of all is a demonic spirit its not from god i think its the enemys favorite tool in his toolbox the sole purpose of which is to keep us from making progress and going forward fears whole design is to stop you in your tracks or to drive you back where you came from instead of you going forward and becoming all that god wants you to be if we believe that our god does not give a spirit of fear but you find or i find in my life that there is a spirit of fear attached to something specific in your life or in your journey an opportunity that youre intimidated by a relationship an endeavor a ministry an interest of yours that just seems to cause you to feel a little bit paralyzed and insecurity or fear if you and i know what we know now based on the scriptures that god does not give fear but you sense that there is a spirit of fear attached to something in your life and you know god didnt give it that means you know who did and if the enemy enemy has placed a spirit of fear on something in your life it must mean that he is trying his best to keep you away from something and if hes trying to keep you away from it that must mean theres something in it that he does not want you to have he wants you and had to be so paralyzed so crippled so disarmed so disinterested from the very thing that he knows is exactly what god wants to take you through so that he can bring you to a new place in him do not be afraid a believer in jesus christ can only have one attitude toward fear and this must be their attitude i will not fear i will not fear fear prevents forward progress is there anyone here who ever feels like that you have let fear keep you from doing what you know you were supposed to be doing i beg you not to give up but to press through and to be all that god wants you to be do all that he wants you to do so you can have all that he wants you to have the reason why you have no reason to be afraid my friend as god calls you to go here or do that or go through this particular thing in your life its not because youre so capable its not because youre so prepared it is because you have a daddy who loves you he has already gone behind the scenes he has already orchestrated and manipulated events and people and circumstances so that all he needs is a woman thats willing to say yes lord and stand there at the plate of his grace and his glory in his calling on your life and to do what hes called you to do and if you and i will just do it we will realize weve been set up to hit a home run every single time so if right now there is something crippling you the enemy is working overtime to cause you to be afraid in your life will you hear this message from the holy spirit today step up to the plate do not be afraid your god has got your back if god is for us then what difference does it make really whos against us because god is certainly greater than anything or anybody that could come against us and you know i think that where we get into trouble is we believe that god is for other people but are we sure that hes for us can i tell you something you having a problem is not a sign that god doesnt care it does not mean that god doesnt see you it does not mean that he does not care about you he wants to help you in your time of need and trouble we give the enemy access to our lives through fear and we give god access to our lives through faith we dont have to be afraid of things god will take care of us whatevers coming up in your future even the stuff that you dont know about god will take care of you come on god will take care of you get it in your head god will take care and thats really all we need to know gods gonna take care of us god has not given us a spirit of fear,1.0

how to write an inspirational speech,you have a gift to share with the world and youre about to deliver a speech what is the best way to write an inspirational speech,an inspirational speech can changesomeones life can inspire someone to take a new actionor to change a belief or a behavior or a number of other things that are reallygood for people and for the world if this sounds like something youd like tolearn how to do then in this video im going to share with you how to write aninspirational speech if you want to write an inspirationalspeech it is really really simple its five simple steps that im gonna sharewith you right now why what who how now thats it let mewalk you through each step the why is painting the big picture its paintingthe reason that your speech matters and is important to the people in the roomits laying out the problem that they might be facing the pain that they mightbe feeling or the challenge that they might be encountering the why of thespeech makes them lean in raise their eyebrows and want to hear more one wayto do that is to ask questions at the beginning of your speech and to startyour speech with ways to get the audience engaged and nodding and sayingyes i want to hear more one great way to open any speech in this way to getpeople to lean in is to say what if what would it be like if by asking a questionlike that youd do something very powerful you get the audience into theirright brain you get them into their imagination you get them into a place ofdesire so you want to open it with a whatif question that positions in thepositive rather than in the negative so a question that i might open a speech aninspirational speech with would be what if work felt like play every single daywhat if people were dying to work with you and were throwing money at youbecause they were so excited with the work that youre doing what would it belike if you were a thought leader and if when you stood up on a stage you couldmove people to take action these are some what if questions that would appealto my audience so think about the people that youre going to be in front of inyour speech what is it that they want what do they desire what is somethingthat that would get them excited and interested in what you have to sharethats the why inside of the why you might also want to share the problem orthe pain point that theyre struggling with so getting into whats in the wayof them having that vision so for example if iasked you what if work felt like play every single day and what it would it belike if people were dying to work with you once youve connected with their whyonce your fief connected with what they want and that desire then you can moveinto whats in the way of them achieving that desire now the second step is thewhat remember i said why what who how now so once youve laid out the why thenits time to bring in the solution what is it that is the solution to thisproblem and not getting into the details of it yet thats the how but gettinginto the overarching solution so for example in the example i gave youearlier where i said what if work felt like play every single day the solutionthe what might be personal branding which is a topic that i teach about andthe way it works is that it helps people drive inbound business without having towork so hard so work feels like play every single day so see how i connectedthat desire that they wanted with the solution that im offering so the whatis where you lay out the solution the big steps of the solution not thenittygritty details of it the third step is the who the who is you how youare going to connect with this audience youve already laid out something to getthem to pique their interest to get them engaged and excited youve shared theproblem or the challenge so youve connected with them on that level andyouve shared that you have a solution but you havent gone deep into it yetthe next thing you want to share is why should we listen to you why do you knowabout this topic what makes you a credible expert so in this section thewho section there are two parts of it one is what makes you a credible expertwhats your experience or your background and whats your story andthis is where you can get into more of an emotional connection now i will saythis a lot of people tell really long stories and a lot of people tell reallyshort stories and youre going to have to decide what works for you what ill sayis that if you spend too much time on your story people might check out but ifyou dont spend enough on your story people wont connect soyoure going to have to find that fine delicate balancei generally spend about to minutes of a to minutes speechworking on or elaborating my story so once youve connected with thempersonally and they understand why youre an expert why they should listento you its time to move into the how phase of your inspirational speechthe how phase is the what it is what are you teaching what are you offering themwhats the solution youre providing but beyond what is it how can they put itinto practice and so the how is where you might outline and go more intodetail of the steps of getting the result that youre teaching them how toget last but certainly not least is the now part of your inspirational speechthats where you give them something they can do right this moment or verysoon after your speech so that they can take action and start generating aresult right away it might be that youre saying hey go buy my book in theback of the room or it might be that they try this exercise or this practicethat youve given them at home or it might be that they buy your product orservice whatever it is you want to give people something that they can do rightaway so that they can generate a result and get momentum i will never forget thetime i saw one of the most inspirational speeches ive ever seen at a tedxconference in miami the speaker was talking about this incredible charitythat he was working with and he told us all all about the great work that theywere doing all over the world and at the end of the speech he left us all hanginghe didnt tell us where we could donate he didnt tell us where we could findout more he didnt offer us the opportunity to contribute to thismission and it felt like a big huge letdown so remember once youve done allthis work to inspire people to teach them something new to change theirperspective to take some action give them an action to take if youre someonewho wants to not only write an inspirational speech but perhaps turn itinto a business or make it a part of your marketing strategy then we can helpwe help people all the time together theyre speaking presentationsand their business models around speaking if that

don t quit trust god when times are hard inspirational amp motivational video,when you go through hard times in your life dont give up god is with you keep trusting god and he will make a way,we all feel like giving up sometimes we all go through times where we feel like god is one million miles away but we dont have any idea what hes doing when were tired when were weary when we think we just cant go on living through a season of struggle that doesnt seem like its ever going to end walking through a trial that you have to endure and it causes you to wonder if you can take the next small step of faith when this year started you thought it was going to be a great year of provision but the provision didnt come when this year began you didnt think it would be a season of sickness and now all youre doing is praying for healing when this year started you were filled with hope and enthusiasm but all youve known is torment and anguish it has been a long year its a year where youve struggled in your business its a year where maybe youve struggled in your home or your marriage its a year in which the things that you thought you would never see happen not only did they happen but they keep happening over and over and over again first you cannot give up when you enter into your long season youve got to give it all youve got when people go into a season of struggle the first thing that they want to do is take a sabbatical but whenever trouble comes the only way that you can get through trouble is work your way through it dont quit how did joseph survive in what others drowned in effort effort comes before excellence when joseph was on his knees scrubbing potiphars floors god was standing over him and he says i know this doesnt look like much joseph but i promise you youre closer to the breakthrough than youve ever been before as a child of god be a person of excellence too many people walk through the long years and they do not survive them why because rather than give it all theyve got they give up listen to the words of the apostle paul he said whatever your hands find to do do it with all of your might why as unto the lord and not unto men god is watching god is the one who will reward you when that time comes let your life be lived in such a way that what you get to hear is well done thou good and faithful servant dont give up when youre walking through the long gears not only do you not give up but you cant give in its going to be in the hardest seasons of your life that the greatest temptations are going to come not just the temptation to quit but the temptation to walk away from your faith the temptation to do what you thought youd never do theres two things that you can do with trouble you can let trouble make you better or you can let trouble make you bitter and thats your choice you know we all suffer dont we we go through things you know the first thing we want to do when were suffering is we want to run we want to get away from it some way shape or form but you know what you got to go through the hard part to get to the good part you got to go through the hard part to get to the good part and that doesnt mean the hard parts always fair life is not always fair but god is fair god is a god of justice and thats one of my favorite things about the character of god and justice means that he always makes wrong things right god always makes wrong things right if we trust him and if we handle the wrong thing in the right way and so when youre going through hard things you got two choices you can give in and give up or you can get strong amen and i believe that we can do anything that god gives us to do but the one thing we cannot do is give up when it gets hard i dont know what you might be going through today but i want you to know that god knows what youre going through today and he knows every little bit of pain that youve got he knows every tear that youve cried and i know youve asked him many times why did my loved one die why did i lose my job why did i lose my retirement why did my house burn down why did why was my house just why why why why why you know what trade all those whys for god i trust you god i trust you i dont know why but i love you enough that i dont have to know why i tell you what i believe that god is good and i dont care what the devil tries i dont care what the world does i dont care what wicked evil people do my god is a good god and i believe that anybody who doesnt believe in him is making a serious mistake in their life you cant just believe believe god when youre on the mountaintop you got to know how to make it through the valleys and stay victorious in your life people want to know why do we have to endure this people ask god whats your plan why these seasons of struggle in this world you will have tribulation you cant deny that why because the source of truth said that job said as surely as sparks fly upward men are born to trouble everyone that god used everyone that god had a plan for everyone who did something great for the king of kings and the lord of lords they went through a struggle they all graduated from the same university of adversity and god has a seat saved for you but what was it about their mindset that would allow them to look at a season of struggle and say think it not strange or they would look at a season of struggle and then they would shout with joy this was not some madeup outcome that they were striving for it was something that they truly enjoyed why because they recognized that whenever they were in a season of struggle god was growing them whenever they were in a season of struggle god was preparing them whenever they were in a season of struggle he was getting ready to open up the windows of heaven and pour out blessings upon them they didnt know how big the blessing would be they didnt know how the outpouring would come they didnt know all of the details but they knew that gods hand was upon them and that he was taking them somewhere that was greater than what they could ask think or imagine so when the problem came they just started praising god and saying thank you jesus youve still got a plan for me when the struggle came they said you know im going to be stronger when this is over im going to be able to endure more im going to be able to do more im going to be able to receive more im going to be able to accomplish more and i assure you child of god if he did that for them hes doing it for you half of the scriptures about suffering half of them which this is really good news are all about god delivering us from suffering however not one of those says when be patient everyone has to wait everyone has to endure but heres what god says will happen for you when you do wait in isaiah he said they that wait upon the lord those who are patient he will renew their strength theyll mount up like wings of eagles theyll run and not grow weary theyll walk and not faint because when you have patience to wait upon the lord you begin to recognize that his promises are what gives you strength its not the outcome that gives you strength its the promise that gives you strength but youre gonna have to go through things i dont care whether you start a business rather youre raising a child you want to get married you want to have a good marriage you want to get your home paid off you want to be in ministry whatever it is youre going to get some opposition from satan a wide door of opportunity opened unto me paul said and with it many adversaries and the reason that you have tribulation is because everything that god gives you the enemy wants to take it from you its a principle god gives you peace he wants to give you worry god gives you health he wants to give you sickness god gives you more than enough he wants to take your more than enough so that you have insufficiency why because he wants you to doubt every promise that god ever made everything that god has given you in your life you have to realize there is an enemy who is very real and he wants to take it jesus said in the world guess what you will have tribulation cheer up i have overcome the world you know what weve already read the end of the book we know whats going to happen be of good cheer because the battle is not yours it belongs to the lord be of good cheer because the enemy that youre facing even though hes trying to cause you to doubt even though hes trying to create worry even though hes trying to build up your concerns be of good cheer because ive already made a public spectacle of him at a place called calvary i have already humiliated him all you have to do is remind him of my name all you have to do is remind him of the power of my blood all you have to do is remind him that whom the son sets free is free indeed and be of good cheer child of god the battle is the lords and the victory is yours through the power of his mighty name we have the privilege of trusting god no matter what were going through we have the privilege of trusting god all things work together for good not all things are good but all things work together for good to those who love god and who trust him put your trust in god dont ever blame god for the wickedness and the evil in the world and try not to live your life saying why god why replace a lot of that with look god i trust you i know youre good and i know this is gonna work out right wake up and recognize that if youve been through some stuff god was with you while you were walking through it and hes with you now hes still on the throne he still has a plan for you hes still working it out in your life he is not going to leave you he is not going to forsake you he has the way through the wilderness and if youll look to him hell lead you and guide you and give you a blessing that you cannot contain im pleading with you today whatever god is trying to do in your life right now even if you dont understand it dont run away from it trust god let him do what he wants to do in you so you can have the life that he really wants you to have,1.0

youre in charge of what you give access to too often when these negative thoughts come we dont think twice we just allow them access go around worry discouraged intimidated start paying attention to what youre dwelling on when discouraging thoughts come nothing good is in your future why do you even have your hopes up youre going to be disappointed again you dwell on that before you let it take root ask yourself where is this thought coming from if its not positive hopeful encouraging its not from godthats the enemy doing what he does best trying to plant negative seeds fearful seeds inferior seeds when the thoughts come theres problems too big the opposition too strong youll never get past it you can let that play and live defeated discouraged intimidated or you can replace it with what god says father you said when the enemy comes against me one way you would defeat them and cause them to flee seven different ways and yes this may be too big for me but i know its not too

how youre going to make it a small tweak father thank you that you have me in the palm of your hand i know youre ordering my steps you said no good thing will you withhold because i walk uprightly now instead of your thoughts defeating you draining your energy limiting your future youre using your thoughts to encourage you to empower you to build your faith imagine someone showed up at your house knocked on your front door you opened it and there was this stranger he was carrying an ax a hammer a rifle a bag of poison all these harmful dangerous things you wouldnt say hey come on in make yourself at home good to see you got some food in the fridge you wouldnt think twice you would tell him you are not welcome here you need to get off my property you would shut the door deadbolted make sure that he left where your mind is your house its where you live theres nothing more valuable more important more sacred why are you letting destructive thoughts in why are you letting fear roam around why are you letting worry have free reign why are you allowing doubt you cant do it its never going to work out to have a seat on your couch thats your property you have complete control over what you let in no you cant stop it from coming it may knock on the door but you dont have to give it access next times fear knocks youll never get well you saw the report the sickness is the end why dont you say no thanks youre not welcome here i will live and not die god is restoring health back unto me when fear not let faith answer imagine fear worry doubt insecurity living in your house dragging you down stealing your joy taking your peace that may be the way its been but this is going to be a new day its time to do some house cleaning you need to evict some tenants that have been living in your mind the good news is youre in charge they may see bigger stronger more powerful but you determine what stays in your mind when your mind is filled with the positive theres no room for the negative when youre full of faith praise gratitude believing for the best when the negative comes you dont even answer the door you dont pay any attention fear knocks but theres a no vacancy sign cant they hear me no this mind is full of faith complaining knocks discouragement sorry no vacancy this mind is full of praise father thank you for what youve done thank you for fighting my battles thank you for surrounding me with your favor when youre in a battle when forces are coming against you in a great way thats when youll be the most tempted to believe the lies youre discouraged its never going to work out just accept it more than ever you need to close the door dont give those lives access you need all your energy to believe to stay strong to have faith to overcome whats trying to stop me be diligent the scripture says give no place to the enemy that means dont give him any rooms in your house dont give him any place in your thinking dont let those lies play in your mind start erasing them and then take the next step replace them with faithfilled favor filled victorious thoughts heres another key youre moving toward what youre constantly thinking about this can be helpful or it can be harmful what are you thinking about your future because i never get any good brains man this pandemic has set me back i wish i had more talent youre moving toward the fee lack mediocrity try a new approach favor is in my future good breaks are chasing me down the right people are headed my way father thank you that the best part of my life is still in front of me when you think like that youre moving toward a favor increase open doors abundance are your thoughts limiting you or your thoughts empowering you are you thinking thoughts of defeat worry cant do it or are you

god s plan for your life nick vujicic inspirational amp motivational video,god loves us and has a good plan for us no matter what our situation nick vujicic shares his inspiring testimony of hope that god,i want you to know that the fear of being alone and having no purpose in your life is one of the most the most disabling things that you will ever experence in your life and you need to know the answer of two questions who are you and what do you want for me i realized as a kid yea there was a choice i had to make either believe what the world said and only believe that broken pieces are ahead for me or believe that god loves me it was hard because when god says in the bible i have a plan for you im thinking really and i prayed for arms and legs what do you want i wanted arms and legs its not that difficult to believe the god of the bible says he has a plan for you do you see this timeline im years old going forwards into the future no idea what was ahead the bible says he has a plan we dont see the plan so its kind of foolish to believe something that you cant see but faith helps you to do that faith is exactly that and faith comes when you hear the word of god when i heard the word of god i still didnt understand his love his plan so i prayed for a blueprint of his plan and he didnt come back to me on that request and when you dont hear from god you then start to conclude what you believe from then on do you decide to keep on believing and waiting to see what happens and trust him or do we conclude to do this there is no god im alone there is no hope there is no purpose im getting bullied for the rest of my life and never getting married never going to have kids never going to be happy man was i wrong or what at age i tried to end my life but im still here all i could see where broken pieces and i had no idea that there would ever be hope for someone truly disabled emotionally mentally spiritually physically the whole thing i mean on every check box i wasent myself sometimes i was so angry angry at my life and i want you to know in your life there will be times where you will feel like youll be on the edge but when you look at the word disabled disabled when you turn your back on the lies like this and you come to the truth the truth will set you free do i look disabled to you today no when you put a go go walk by faith and not by sight and you put a go in front of the word disabled it spells god is able to do what ephesians exceedingly abundantly more then you could ever ask imagine or retain what does that mean it actually means that god has a good plan he never with holds any good gifts i was years old and i read john chapter a man was born blind and no one knew why jesus was asked by everyone why was this man born blind my doctors dont know why i was born this way my parents dont know why i was born this way and i want you to know that we dont have any answers for my bith defect jesus said this blind man was born this way because gods works are going to be revealed through him jesus spits on the dirt puts mud on the face of the blind man and there is no record of the blind man saying anything flinching asking anything moving backward nothing jesus performs his miracle as he is still i realized jesus did not sit the blind man down and say mr blindman my name is jc im the healer im about to spit in the dirt and give you a facial and after we wipe the mud off your face your going to see he didnt do that god doesent need to tell me his plan i just need to be still and believe he has a plan thats when you walk by faith why would you need faith if god told you everything if i was age and i prayed for arms and legs and god instead told me everything he was going to do until the age of you have to be kidding me i would die of shock writing books languages if god can use a man without arms and legs to be his hands and feet then who can god not use he loves you and he can do anything with your broken pieces,1.0
taking control of your life s destiny howtolive inspirational talk,selfrealization fellowship monk brother vishwananda shares wisdom from paramahansa yogananda on how to become,good evening everyone lets start this evening byclosing our eyes id like all of you to repeat after melets begin with just a short affirmation beloved god i set aside all thoughts and cares of this material world to go within and be alone with thee if we look at our lives objectivelyand look at the world today it is a very challenging worldthat we live in isnt it and think about it you look around and there seems to bechaos and unrest and fear and uncertainty and hatred you know the list goeson and on and on and we try to live our livesin the midst of this seeming chaos and try to spiritualize it try the best of our ability to figure out whats our placein the midst of all of this and we ask this question are our circumstancescontrolling our lives id like to start by reading a few short quotes fromguruji s autobiography of a yogi because until we reallyunderstand life and lifes purpose how can we begin to even thinkthat we can have any control over it and from the autobiographyyou may remember how babaji had called lahiri mahasaya to the himalayan caveand given him his kriya yoga and there was a little interchangebetween lahiri mahasaya and babaji where babaji said bestowthe kriya key only on qualified chelas he who vows to sacrifice allin the quest of the divine is fit to unravelthe final mysteries of life through the science of meditation vows to sacrifice all was what babaji said and lahiri mahasaya said angelic guru as you have already favored mankindby resurrecting the lost kriya art will you not increase that benefit by relaxing the strictrequirements of discipleship i pray that you permit me tocommunicate kriya to all sincere seekers even though at first they maynot be able to vow themselves to complete inner renunciation the tortured men and womenof the world pursued by the threefold sufferingneed special encouragement they may never attemptthe road to freedom if kriya initiation bewithheld from them be it so the divine wishhas been expressed through you give kriya to all whohumbly ask for help babaji replied and after a silence he added repeat to each of your disciples thismajestic promise from the bhagavad gita swalpamapyasya dharmasya trayatemahato bhayat even a little practice of this dharma this religious rite will save you from great fear the colossal sufferings inherent in the repeated cyclesof birth and death i think this is a very significant part of paramahansa yoganandasmessage in the autobiography because as i look out and see the faces ofour beloved guru s disciples gathered from all over the world the light the love the joythat i see in your faces it began here because how many of uswere ready for complete renunciation this tradition goes back in india only the ascetics who left the worldcomplete inner renunciation so i think when we think aboutour lives in the world today its very important for us to developan attitude toward our lives first and foremost basedupon the blessings that each and every one of usexperience every moment of our lives earlier this year i wasin india at ranchi where we dedicateda new meditation hall there were over a thousanddevotees there from all over india and also a good numberof srf members visiting and once we had actuallyopened up the mandir and entered in for the consecration of the altar there were too many people thereto invite all in at the same time so i was given the task of choosingsome representative groups to go inside and it was fairly easyfor the indian devotees because i decided to take two representatives fromeach of the meditation groups the cities that was fairly easy and then i asked for a list of thesrf devotees and where they were from and as i went through the listi was amazed to find out there were devoteesfrom australia and africa and south americaand central america and north america andall over europe and from asia and fromthe middle east the whole world was representedat least symbolically and it impressed upon me to realizethis is the depth and the breadth of this gurus teachings a guru who lefthis physical body in the early s and yet this work continues to growwith such great strength and particularly in india wheretheyve had this great and old tradition of you have to have a living guru which is usually interpreted ashaving a guru in a physical body and yet guruji s work thrives and grows not just in indiabut all over the world why why because we do have living gurus and we are part of a veryspecial dispensation sent by god at what seems like a verytroubled time in the world outwardly and its based upon this promisethat were sitting here tonight so as we begin to think aboutand discuss you know are life s circumstancescontrolling our lives i think it should start withopening up our hearts in gratitude not just tonight not justduring convocation but every day every day because out of the billionsthe billions of souls on this earth even the atheist you knoweven the avowed atheist when hes at his rope s endand he has no more hope what does he usually cry oh god help me isnt it intuitively he knows theres a godwe all do but out of the billions in the worldhow many have a path a direction a teaching a true guru a living gurua line of gurus and have been drawn into the foldof a special dispensation sent by god very humbling isnt itwhen you think about it in those terms ill put that in a littlemore perspective as we go along but i think when we face lifewe face life s challenges we should always begin there and just as i started the eveningwith that short affirmation to learn to think in those terms to consciously set aside all thoughtsand cares of the material world and first first with gratitude with great thanks to the gurus begin your life begin your day begin your battle of lifein that consciousness from guruji s bhagavad gita commentary from the moment of conceptionto the surrender of the last breath man has to fight in each incarnationinnumerable battles biological hereditarybacteriological physiological climaticsocial ethical political sociological psychologicaland metaphysical well im out of breath so many varietiesof inner and outer conflicts competing for victory in every encounterare the forces of good and evil and on top of everything elsetheres this tug of war going on the whole intent this is the point listen to this the whole intent of the gitais to align mans efforts on the side of dharma or righteousness the ultimate aim is selfrealization of mans true self the soulas made in the image of god one with the everexistingeverconscious ever new bliss of spirit and heres the second point id liketo bring to your attention tonight of all of the great blessingsthat these gurus have brought to our livestheyve also brought the purpose of life how can you fight the battleof life if you dont know the purpose some years ago i readi think it was a business book and there was a littlecatchy saying there that said imagine climbing to the topof the ladder of success in your life total success only to discoverthat the ladder s on the wrong building no we laugh but look around in our own liveshow many undertakings you know how much of ourtime and energy and our focus have we put on somethingonly to reach a dead end total dead end no happinessno fulfillment no satisfaction no results why why usually if we analyze because it wasntaddressing the real purpose of our lives its a key pointwe have to understand that very much cannot forget that if the purpose of life is to find god and here we have you are spirityou are made in the image of god and you can realize this truththrough the practice of kriya yoga wherein you are taught to go within contact your true natureand commune with god sounds pretty simple doesnt it so all we have to dois just go within contact god and yet theres nothingmore important than that this is where it beginsand this is where it ends if the purpose of life is to find god and if we realize thatour true nature is spirit and that ultimately all of thisthat we see and feel and touch and smelland hear is delusion is not reality its not realityits not reality its not real what hope do we have no wonder theres a tug of war if the reality is withinand yet we feel trapped we re in these bodiesisnt it pretty real master said a dream head you knowagainst a dream wall causes dream pain you know were still stuck here i think we better join the atheist god help o god help us and of course we haveor we wouldnt be here but you see my point now there is this tug of warthat were in and we have these wonderful techniqueswe have this wonderful teaching but theres workthere s serious work for us to do on top of that long listof challenges guruji said you were born withabout seventyfive percent of your life predetermined by your past seventyfive percent its pretty grim doesnt it but guruji said you will make upthe remaining twentyfive percent if you yourself throughyour own free choice and effort of will do not determine whatthat twentyfive percent will be the seventyfive percent will makethe twentyfive percent for you and you will become a puppet right theres the answerright there is the answer free choice effort of will free choice and effort of will action and if we dont you willbe ruled absolutely by your past by the influence and effectsof your past tendencies this is whya spiritual training is vital it takes into consideration not onlythe seventyfive percent of our lives that we already are but also designatesthe methods to mold the brand new twentyfive percentthat we ourselves are going to create by the exercise of our freedom thats the answer right therethats yoga thats yoga in action right there through free willand freedom of choice we can win this battle iswhat guruji is saying guruji said the practice of ahighly advanced technique such as kriya is incompatible with adesultory spiritual life kriya yoga is more thana meditation technique its more than just going within but thats where it startswe cant forget that first and foremost people would go to guruji our beloved daya mata and theother disciples that were around him they didnt have satsangas like this they didnt have long lecturesthey didnt have classes it was usually just twosimple answers one was meditate meditatemeditate and the other waskeep your mind on god keep your mindhere at the spiritual center over and over and over he wouldrepeat that with all his wisdom that was two ofhis strongest messages but it always began withmeditate meditate meditate because its only through meditation its only by setting aside our thoughtsand cares of this material world and going withinwithdrawing the life force withdrawing it from whatfrom the senses from the instruments that perceive this world as being real drawing that consciousness inside shutting off those instruments magnetizing the spine gradually raising the life force into the higher chakraswhere god can be experienced and then in that consciousness in that consciousness guruji said meditate meditate meditate but also keep your mind on god thats the other half of the equation thats how we livein this world and not of it if the purpose of life is to find god if our true nature is spirit we must to the best of our abilitystrive to contact that true self and then through our actionsthroughout the day to hang onto to stay in that consciousness to be in the world but not of it how does the bhagavad gita beginyou remember that great textthat great guide to life that great guide to yogic livingthat great guide to liberation that our beloved guru has givento the world transcends time the truth of that book the power ofthat book and the simplicity of that book transcends time again its one of those great blessingsthats part of that great dispensation thats so much a part of our lives and it begins by saying on the holy plane of kurukshetra when my offspring and the sons of panduhad gathered together eager for battlewhat did they o sanjaya what did they the good and bad symbolically the negative and the positive onthe battlefield of life how did they the bhagavad gitabegins with introspection and this is another oneof those keys another one of those blessings emphasized by our guru thats necessaryif were to win this battle of life from the bhagavad gita each devotee should analyze himselfand find out whether he is living according to the upwardevolutionary influence of nature or by the even higher soul impulses or only by his human nature distorted by prenatal and postnataleffects of evil actions karma that manifests through habitsmoods and inclinations how did they if youre going to fight a battleyou need to know not only who the enemy isbut the nature of the enemy when the sunshine of wisdombreaks upon the dark mind of the egotist he realizes thatthe soul is the performer of all actions and not his unpredictable individuality his ego his little self his little self as perceivedby the instruments by identification with the world the soul or spiritis the only activator so if were going to winthis battle of life we have to always actto the best of our ability from what state of consciousnesssoul consciousness soul consciousness god gave us free willand we have the choice in every moment of our livesto act from soul awareness and if we dont have thatsoul awareness that higher state of consciousness or we have it to varying degrees all the way from nirvikalpa samadhito none at all what do we do we have the wisdomand the guidance of the guru again thats partof this great dispensation truth truth as has never been givento mankind in our hands in a modern scientific simpleunderstandable doable language unique unique thats our guide and what do we do do we carry abhagavad gita around with us under one arm and the second coming volumeunder the other and no theres a lot there to absorb and thats why guruji putso much emphasis on study now read a little bit even ifits not a lot keep putting his thoughtsinto your consciousness keep putting his teachingsinto your consciousness little by little absorb them little by little absorb them and then if you act from within when the time comeswhen you need help it will be there it will be there its powerfulbut you have to make the effort its another one of those keys studyis one of the pillar stones of this path for many years i was the secretary to ananda mata the younger sister ofour president daya mata and my office in those days wasin the basement of the main building the international headquartersbuilding at mother center and her office wason the top floor on the third floor and the way we worked wasshe would telephone and say come up come upwe need to see you so id run up the stairsas we always would do to get there as soon as we could and go running into the roomsit down completely out of breath you know mind just racing you know you cant concentrate whenyoure huffing and puffing and huffing all the way from the basementtheres no way to avoid it and she would totally ignore metotally ignore me she would just there andkeep working as if i wasnt there at all and at first it bothered mea little bit but then i tried to bedetached and i realized i tried i realized what she was doing was giving me a chance to calm down to calm down so that we could work andi could be in tune with her thoughts and she could share with me and then i realized once i realized that i realized she always kepta chair outside of her office i never saw anyonesitting out in the hallway working so i thought that chairis there for me to sit down why should i go in there and disturb herwith my huffing and puffing while shes workinglet me settle down and the first time i did thati finally got settled down interiorized my consciousness againand i heard her little voice say you can come in now its a sweet little story isnt it but what a lessonyou know what a lesson in life how many times do we approachserious circumstances in our life huffing and puffing you knowout of breath restless mind how many times but theres a message if were to act from soul consciousnesswe have to be calm we have to make a conscious effort to interiorize our consciousness before we thinklet alone before we act i lived in india serving in guruji s ashrams foralmost years continuously and during that time i didntsee my parents once physically see them and two of those were in those good old days it seems like weve madesome progress in this world we didnt have cell phoneswe didnt have internet and to place a telephone call in india you called the operator and usually waited withoutexaggeration or hours you finally got the calla lot of static and noise and usually got cut off then the whole process started over again so i didnt have a lot of communication with my parents except writing and something for me personally happened i began to lookbeyond their personalities beyond the experience of the senses which you know its nice if you and your parentsget along but sometimes as youre growing upyou just dont quite see eye to eye so it wasnt always totally harmonious but i began to see beyond all of that and i began to think of themin terms of their qualities their qualities and i took it one step further what do i see in myselfof those same qualities and i was able to communicate thatto them when i finally came back and they were very deeply touched for the first time in my life i heardmy father tell me that he loved me very powerful this is another key to success in life in your dealings with people you know its a wonderful world itsa beautiful world the trouble is people do we look at people do we build our relationships based upon the message of the senses the information of our senses or from our soul the qualitiesthe qualities that we see in people think of that itll change your life itll change your relationship think of that if im a soul maybetheres other souls out there this is something i learnedfrom ananda moyi ma the joypermeated mother that master writes aboutin the autobiography what is your concept of a person whos materialistic big mansion hole golf course in his backyard drives around in you know big cadillacs what does it mean to be materialistic ananda moyi ma said you are materialistic if you forget that god is the doer you are materialistic if you forgetthat god is the doer now what does that mean from the bhagavad gita from guruji the bodyidentified man imagineshis ego to be the doer of all actions during all activities performedby the senses mind and life force the egotist thinks i am the doer he is engrossed in the i am feelings i am seeing i am walking i am living i am discriminating i am in control and so on the undisciplined man and the selfcontrolled sageboth perform bodily actions the sensualist is bound by desires and if he dies without conquering them he is born again to satisfy his unfulfilled human longings but the yogi who performs his duties as enjoined by god without personal motives that is from soul consciousnessand realizing that god is the doer remains free from any karma resulting from workingin any way with the body he is not required to be reborn because of personal desiresconnected with his body theres a story in indian mythology of one of the gods one of the more benevolent gods and he had a messengerwith him one of the sages that would go back and forthfrom the higher realms down to earth and the messengerwas complaining to this god as they were looking downthere was this poor beggar walking down the road cursing god for his bad luck for his poverty for his lackof opportunities in life disgruntled and the messenger said god why dont you help him why dont you do somethingits so easy for you and the lord said all right he said all right he said why dont we takethis loaf of bread and well put this big chunk of gold in the bread and you take it down and you set it in the roadin front of him because i dont want him to knowit came from me he said all right lord thats goodthats good lets try this so the man is going down the road and upset about his life cursing god left and right and he said the only thingworse in life he said that god could have cursedme anymore than ive already been is if i would have been born blind i just think ill close my eyesand just pretend im blind and walked right past the loaf of bread how many opportunities in life have we passed by forgetting god because our consciousnesswas so caught up in our problems in the conflicts of the world in what we think is our bad luckor our bad karma and walked right past the lump of gold interesting isnt it its a nice little story but it has some meaning for usif we think about it about this importance of always acting fromthis inner consciousness this inner consciousness this awareness this awareness that were spirit i was once on a bus up in the himalayas i d been staying at our dwarahat ashram early morning we had about a hour bus trip i think along one of the more back gravel roads along the side of some of the reallysteeper mountains very narrow by this small bus probably with about maybe people crowded in and one of the last people to get in was this drunk you know not that we knew that he drank but he was drunk and probably had been for several days from his appearance and his odor completely repulsive and here we are in this crowded little bus shoulder to shoulder middle of the winter freezing cold you dont dareput a window down and hes raving and talkingand babbling and going on everyone you know as the miles go by becomes a little more disgustedwith this man and each one is probably weavingtheir own thoughts about what a terrible person this isand what a hopeless life hes leading and we come around this corner on this narrow little roadand there d been a landslide probably about feet of the roadwas completely covered with rocks and gravel not very deep maybe feet deep and were on this narrow littlemountain road its you know not a few feet it s hundreds of feet down the side of this mountain and we would have had to back up for maybe half a mile to the closest place where we could ve turned around and you know to move all thatrock and gravel would ve even with all those peoplewould have taken days you needed a tractor or somethingsome kind of implement and so we stood around and talkedand wondered what to do for about minutes and this drunk went up to the driverand said do you have a shovel and the driver kind of laughed and said you know ive got a shovel lets give it to him you knowlets give him the shovel maybe hell leave us alone you know that kind of attitude and they gave him the shovel and you know what he did he didnt try to remove all those rocks and stones he went over to the landslidethat was already there and started tapering off the side and went over to the other sideand tapered it off and smoothed out somerough part in the middle and then told the driver to drive over it and we did it worked its a nice little storybut do you see what happens to us you see how circumstances in lifecan control our minds and our attitudesand our perceptions of people if were judging them through the senses and forgetting whos the doer whos the doer its those qualities those divine qualitiesthat are in each and every one of us that shine throughwhen we least expect it dont forget dont ever forget that god is the doer when you pray do you believe god is listening you may ask me why do i ask that question it seems rather odd doesnt itthat id ask that but think about it when you pray do you really believe that god s listening good because he is he may not always answer in the time and in the way that we might expect but we must believe we must believe that god does answer and sometimes during the really tryingdifficult times of life if were sincere in our prayers our outer circumstancesmay not change at all but sometimes we receive a little message some little response that gods saying you know i love you my child i know what youre going throughim right here with you lets keep going im here with you and thats enough isnt it it just reminds you how closeyou really are to god as you are connected with godand you can carry on you can face earlier this year when i was at ranchi during that function that we had forthe dedication of the meditation hall one evening i was on the front porchof the main building which is the building whereguruji started his school and that beautiful ashramthat we have there and a devotee approached me one that id known for over years and i could tell as she approached me that there wassomething very deeply troubling her and she came up and almost with tearsin her eyes said swamiji swamiji what am i going to dowhat am i going to do she said years ago when our beloved daya mata was in india she gave me a little krishna pendant that ive worn all these years and its been my protectionmy inspiration and ive lost it the little ring that held it onfinally wore out ive lost it weve looked everywhere it was tiny and she said what am i going to do she said ive been prayingand calling to god it meant so much to mewhat am i going to do and i thought for a minute i dont know what im going to do so i started prayingas desperately as she was and then a thought came to me a thought came to me that maybe two years beforei had been with ma before the departure ofone of my trips to india and shed given me this little box and she said vishwanandathese are some little things i used to take with mewhen i went to india and i used to give themto devotees sometimes little things and she saidyou take these with you and if you ever have the opportunity you could give them outlike i used to do so i thought about that i had kept it in my room at ranchi so i said excuse me for a minutelet me ive got something i need to do so i left the devotee and went upstairs i opened the little box and it had you knowthese rudraksha beads and little statues and different things and there was one little packet maybe inches by inches squarewrapped in paper i didnt even know what was in it i opened it up it was a little krishna statue so i took it down she held out her hand she didnt say a word didnt say a word she just and walked off i knew it was the same that ma had probably had for years coincidence no you have to understand this world of duality is basedupon some very exacting laws of cause and effect and if you understand thatnothing happens by chance nothing happens by chance god is the doer god is the doer and we transcend we transcend even the lawsof cause and effect with our devotion and our love very important to remember very important to remember when i received my kriya initiationat ranchi in india in the early s when our beloved ma was there she performed it and it was done outside under this little covered area almost all of us sitting crosslegged and during the rose ceremony and i had sat in the back and during the rose chantthe rose ceremony i was watching ma it was so beautiful to see her flowing robes and her long hair flowing looking like a rishi an ancient rishi radiant radiant after the kriya after performing you knowthe instrument for the guru and i noticed in front of methere was this man sitting crosslegged and he had his hands like this up at the junctureof his thighs and i saw ma take the flowersand throw them so they landed in his hands and i thought thats wonderful i said im going to do that you watch ma s going to throwthose flowers right in my hand too and she continued on there were others in front of megetting closer and closer and then the thought came to me you know thats ridiculous thats very egotistical of me toeven think that ma would do that that was something specialfor that devotee this is your kriya initiation so i turned my hands up like this and was meditating and suddenly somethinghit me in the chest and i looked down and what ma had done she wasnt sprinklingthe petals on my head shed thrown them at meand hit me in the chest well i thought thats all rightthats something pretty special but trying to figure outwhy did she do that and i looked down and the flowers had slid down my chest into my hands you think we have control of our lives no god is the doergod is the doer and when we surrender when we surrender our egoto god then that communion can flowthen that inner guidance can flow then that divine joy that lovecan flow into your life and thats what carries us throughthe challenges of the day sometimes there are some very big tests and trials in life isnt it some of us may have really good karmaand not face them but interestingly enough something that i learnedfrom brother anandamoy in one of his talks that we dont know where we are on the evolutionary ladder and when we receive kriya yoga initiation the guru promisesthat if we make the effort that he will lead us toand we will find god in this lifetime quite a promise isnt it and you think that guru wants usto kind of mope along and drag along no i dont think so i think thatguru wants us to get back home just as quickly as we possibly can the guru will never give usmore than we can take but sometimes the guru will give usthose tests and those trials or those experiences that we need to break the final chains we dont know how close we are maybe that big test that seems so insurmountableis the last one not that it matters but it might be it might be the last one from guruji s gita commentary man himself by his actions reapsthe results of his good and bad karma owing to the proper useor misuse of his free will often its not that god or guruare even testing us its our own debt you know we dont run awayfrom the bank every month when we have our mortgage paymentor insurance payment do we no we make those pretty regularly but sometimes we run awayfrom our karmic debts isnt it we run away from them we dont accept themin other words as being our own that we might have caused this to happen to ourselves and especially in a world that likesto point its finger everywhere else except here thats the world we live in and guruji went on to say in this sense god does not remain in this universe asa watcher of human beings constantly rewarding or punishing themaccording to their virtues or sins but he made lawswhich do mete out invariable justice so regardless of whats happening to usin our lives we have to have this attitudethis soul attitude it s really not happening to me if im a soul if im spiritits really not happening to me ive caused this through my pastwrong actions wrong thinking whatever it wasand this is a debt that i have to pay and sometimes our actionsdont seem to bring results i had a particular test in my lifeit kept coming back and coming back andcoming back in different forms but i knew it was the same thingthat i had to work on and i was working really hardon this trying to overcome it you know thinking i could control iti was going to overcome it and one day i woke up and i realizedgod was trying to teach me patience it had nothing to dowith what was happening outwardly or the circumstances that kept recurring god just wanted me to be patient he was teaching mea divine spiritual quality and i would havenever gained control if i would havei wouldnt have learned the lesson so we have to look upon lifea little differently we have to look upon our tests and trials a little differently and in fact learn to embrace them as opportunities to clear away the past karma that we ourselves created to pay our debt to pay our debtand also to exercise our soul qualities to bring god in to bring in gods joyto bring in gods understanding to bring in gods patienceto bring in gods love thats who we are thats who we areto express who we really are and in so doingwere not creating any new karma were burning out our old karma and were on the pathof breaking those final bonds that lead to that final state of realization one last one if you find yourselfpassing through hell keep going thats pretty profound isnt it keep on keeping onkeep on keeping on one of the things i learnedfrom my father he used to say you knoweven if you fall flat on your face what do you do do you lay there and just grovelwith your face in the mud or do you get up and move on he said if you get upyouve progressed at least this far have hope have hope have faith have trust have the assurance that you are blessed by god you live under the umbrellaof a special dispensation sent by god for this age the gurus knowthe challenges of our lives the gurus knowthe ups and downs the gurus know the nature ofthe battles that we have to face and theyve given us special blessings theyve told us the purpose of lifeis to find god very very important isnt it they show us that god is the doerthat were not ultimately we can control what we can controlis our consciousness what we can control is our awareness of god and then express that through our actions thats what we can control it begins with meditation it begins with meditation and it begins by living our lives every moment of our lives expressing free choiceand choosing to apply our guru s teachingsto follow our intuition that inner sensethat we gradually develop we open up our heartsthrough love and devotion to god so that that divine lovecan flow through us if we want to change the worldyou know what we can change ourselves ourselves we can change the worldwe can do it by changing ourselves if we become more peacefulthe world is more peaceful if we become more understandingthe world is more understanding if we become more lovingthe world is more loving its filled with more divine love that we can dobecause love is more powerful the love of god is more powerful its the saving gracethat transcends the tug of war the laws of dualitythe cause and effect the positive and the negative that we can changefrom the center of our true being from our soulfrom our awareness of god from the realizationthat we are one with god i was with ma recently a group of us and we were talkingabout the challenges of the work in spreading masters teachings and i think our minds were probablya little too caught up in all the details and the thingsthat we thought needed to be done and ma just suddenly said you all have to become saints and just like you we all laughed and ma joined in it was very sweetyou know just a sweet little laughter and after the laughter died down she very quietly but also very powerfully said im serious you know now she wasnt sayinglets go out and lets be saints her own life is proof of that that radiant divinepowerful soul that ma is you look at the accomplishments of her life she could have commanded any stage any spiritual stage in india in this country anywhere in the world people would have flockedto her by the thousands and i saw this in indiawhen she was there in and one evening she was giving a farewell satsanga to a group of devotees in a public temple i think it wasa weekend night there was a lot of local people coming inand we were in an adjacent room and the vast majority of those peoplewho were coming they were just common folk who didnt even understand english but ma just the vibrationthat she had created in that room and those simple people were so receptive that they started crowding and pushing in to have darshanto touch her feet for her blessing and those of us who were therethe monastics actually had shoulder to shoulder with arms around each other form a ring around ma and leadher out so that she wasnt crushed thats the powerof her divine love and yet now that was almost years ago how has she chosen to live her lifeshes now how has she chosen to live her life quietly humbly serving her guru quietly humbly showing usyou know we have a perfect guru in ma we have a perfect disciple we have an example you have a perfect example in ma she asked us to be saintsbecause she knew that thats what our soul wants she knows that if we really apply these teachings if we really try to liveits not to be a saint but its to live a saintly life thats the blessing that we have and thats what ma has asked all of usnot just us few but i pass that on to all of us to not lose sight of the very special blessingthats upon our lives and where does it lead i received this letter just a fewdays ago from a very old friend who wasnt able to come to convocation this year i dont hear from him often usually i see him here at convocationand we say hello otherwise our friendship is on a higherlevel i dont need to talk with him or communicate with him but heres what he wrote as i have gotten older heseems to be with me more and more whenever i stop and settle my mindfor even a moment i feel his presence i constantly bug him

overcoming the past letting go of hurt inspirational amp motivational video,are you suffering from the pain of your past letting go of the hurt is one of the hardest things to do but holding on to the anger,somebody hurt you a year ago years ago or a lifetime ago and somehow deep down inside you cant shake it sometimes you say it never happened but you know deep down inside it did happen so you try to deny it and that doesnt work you suppress it and somehow it keeps popping out and sometimes it pops out an embarrassing fashion you know the deep down inside something happened back there that you can really identify in fact you can point your finger to the person and what seemingly was merely a little hurt in the beginning somehow as solidified like concrete in your mind its just there it lays there it hangs there the burden of it is there youd like to shake it youd like to get rid of it but somehow you just cant do it you got hurt so badly that somehow you feel like i will never be able to overcome this well i want to tell you my friend yes you can because you see if you dont overcome the hurts of the past what youll find out is this those hurts can do great great harm to your life so what we have to do is we have to decide how were going to handle this hurt am i going to handle this hurt in such a way that it harms me in every aspect of my life or am i going to learn how to handle this hurt in such a fashion that i can take it and i can handle it properly and be able to learn something from it glean something from it grow up as a result of it and not allow it to hurt me because god does not want us to respond to hurts in such a fashion that we are devastated in our life lose our witness and our testimony go through life bearing some kind of emotional baggage that we are never able to escape and our great physician says i got the prescription he said whats happening is you get hurt by somebody and it it turns to anger and that anger eventually if not dealt with right it turns to bitterness and if that bitterness just stays there it becomes what the bible calls a hardened heart and it changes who we are as people it changes who i trust or dont it changes who i let in or dont it changes how i respond out of my insecurities it changes how i crush people with my words it changes how if i just meet you i start off not trusting you instead of trusting you it fires off my insecurities and all kinds of it changes this hardened heart that comes from bitterness it changes who we are and how we live and the great physician says i got the prescription here it is you dont have to live that way heres the prescription be kind and compassionate to one another and heres the word forgive forgiving each other just as in christ god forgave you the great physician says i got the prescription and its forgiveness and if you can actually go through this but he doesnt he doesnt pull punches he said im not going to play around its a painful process sometimes to forgive and depending on the wound or the hurt that youre trying to forgive for it can be even more painful im not coming to you from a place of i dont know any hurt now i dont know your hurt but i know that it hurts i know what that feels like and i know that god says i want to take you through this process called forgiveness because you can get rid of that hurt which will get rid of that anger which you get rid of that bitterness which will begin to soften your heart and change the way you live he says i got the prescription its called forgiveness and its not easy to talk about but if you can actually walk through it itll change things forgiveness is about freedom it is not about justifying the other persons actions its not us saying it was okay that you left it was okay that you abused it was okay that you betrayed it was okay that you lied it was okay that no were not were not justifying anybodys actions by forgiving them gotta be gotta be clear on this were not letting anybody off the hook god says dont worry justice is my job wrath is my job judgment is my job i got you there are consequences for people who hurt my kids i got you nobodys getting let off the hook here its not a guarantee of reconciliation its not a guarantee that well ever do life together again because forgiving doesnt mean we keep doing life together right listen to this do not repay anyone evil for evil be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone if it is possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone do not take revenge my dear friends but leave room for gods wrath for it is written it is mine to avenge i will repay says the lord and and until we can actually surrender our right to punish the person who hurt us we havent actually forgiven heres what i heres what i keep hearing oh i forgave him for that but then later in a conversation you go oh really am i really going to trust you because i couldnt trust you last year oh is that really what you mean because i think weve been here before havent we oh now i can trust you now now i can trust you oh i did i forgave you im still going to make you pay for it youve got to actually forgive and say im not going to make you pay for that mistake anymore thats what forgiveness looks like and thats when whats going to allow us to continue in this relationship and see all god wants us to see man this is huge we got to surrender our right to punish lets define what forgiveness is not forgiveness is not justifying the other persons actions forgiveness is not forgetting it it is not denying it it is not excusing what that persons done to you you see if i forgive someone heres what ive done ive said i deliberately and willfully lay down put aside this debt that you owe me as a result of somehow the way you hurt me and so im going to lay it aside i put it down no longer hold it against them anymore now does that mean that uh everything is absolutely correct between us not necessarily because you see listen carefully you and i are not responsible for someones response to our forgiveness you may be forgiving god may heal you and the other person who did something to you may not ever be healed they might not be interested in healing their malice is just as strong today as it was yesterday and so therefore they may never change but you know what you and i are responsible for changing no matter what the other person does we are not responsible for another persons actions they are responsible their own responses they give an account to god for their own responses and then accept the forgiveness that you have given to the other person as done and my friend from that moment on the healing process will take place in your life begin to take place in your life and what could have was harming you and hurting you far more deeply than you realize the healing process will begin to take place and god will set you free you know sometimes we think that were actually hurting the person who hurt us by holding on to the hurt and holding a grudge that somehow me being mad long after the event happened that thats somehow making you miserable all right its like drinking poison and hoping you kill them with it youre only hurting yourself with your anger let me ask you this is it worth it is it worth it holding on to that grudge is it worth it being bitter bitterness is not worth it resentment is not worth it the price is too high you need to not go one more second without dealing with it right now how do i let go of a hurt that i dont want to let go of what do i do with my hurt first thing number one give it to god give it to god let him handle it unload it on the lord well you say it like this god this hurt is too heavy for me to carry and im not smart enough to know whats the right thing to do about it and ill probably make a mess of it so father im giving you this hurt that person hurt me and i would like for you to handle it its now out of my hands i wash my hands its in your hands thats what you say you give it to god who can handle it better you are god never avenge yourselves leave it to god theres evidence in scripture and evidence from looking at other peoples lives that no matter what kind of a past you have you still have a great future out in front of you but you must let go of the past and for some people that means forgiving someone else for some people it may mean forgiving yourself or actually receiving the forgiveness of god so many people are mad at themselves and they wont forgive themselves for mistakes that theyve made and things that theyve done and honestly and truly until you let go of the past you really cannot take hold of the future that god has for you every great man and woman has to rise above the pain of their past to reach their godgiven destiny theres a couple of sayings that i like one is until you let the past die it will not let your future live you have to forgive even yourself you have to believe that the blood of jesus is greater than your sin and it is forwhere sin does abound grace does much more abound we have to forgive people and forgive ourselves and stop letting the past have control over our lives another saying that i like is forgiveness doesnt make them right it just makes us free im not saying theyre right and some people even though i forgive them im not going to let them in my life to get another shot at me that that would not be wise but im not going to keep rehearsing and nursing the hurts and offenses of my past and letting the devil keep coming and condemning me for the things ive done wrong those things dont have any power over me anymore im going to let them go and i heard this saying one time never follow a general without scars and thank god our general has scars dont ever dont ever follow some poser that pretends as though they dont have any problems and theyre above everything dont ever do that whatever has wounded you whatever you hide whatever happened see when jesus shows thomas his scars im glad he kept his scars im glad he kept that part im glad he didnt stay dead but im also glad that he came out scarred because that gives me hope jesus was healed of his deadly wounds but he was not healed of his scars the scar became a testimony of gods ability to heal when jesus rose from the dead he was healed of his deadly wounds but god did not take the scars away we want complete restoration where nobody knows we ever had an issue we want such restoration that nobody knows that our perfect lives were not perfect we want everybody to think that we have the picture perfect family the pictureperfect marriage the pictureperfect life and there has nothing because of my great faith ever come to my home but scars are a testimony of gods ability to heal deadly wounds scars mean this is what i overcame this is what how bad it was and this is how good god has healed me and im not ashamed of my scars and jesus walked into the upper room after he rose from the dead and he said some people need to see my scars like thomas or theyll never believe im saying to you quit covering up your scars they remind you of what youve been healed of wear them as a badge of honor the scar proves how bad it was at one point hallelujah id be a fool to walk around and act like ive never had marriage problems ive never had family problems ive never wanted to quit but what you do is you look at the devil and you say you see these scars theyre proof that youve tried your best with mortal wounds to destroy me to wipe me out to destroy my family but no weapon formed against us could prosper because i serve a god who heals deadly wounds quit acting like youre perfect will god be able to use us if we have an unpleasant past well to be honest i think its easier for him to use people who have actually experienced some problems in their life than those maybe who had it absolutely perfect simply for the reason that you can have compassion more if youve gone through something yourself now that doesnt mean that god cant use people that havent been through all that because he certainly can but i know all the bad stuff that happened to me god has used it now and so what does the bible say that he he works all things together for our good it doesnt have to be good for god to turn it into something good and thats really one of the greatest promises in the word and one that we really need to think about more no matter what it is if its my mistake if its something somebody did to me god can take it if we what does it say if we love him and we want his will thats it just love him and want his will and give it to him and hell be able to take it and make something good of it,1.0
growing in faith and unconditional love howtolive inspirational talk,selfrealization fellowship nun sister bhakti shares wisdom from paramahansa yogananda on how we can face difficult,well good morningto all of you one of the most inspiringsights of convocation is to see guruji s spiritualfamily gathered together like this we look forwardto it every year and we hope that each one of you willfeel the joy and the spiritual strength that can come from makingthis united effort to absorb guruji s teachingsand to deeply think of god and as we beginthis morning s satsanga let s just take a moment to quietlyturn the mind toward god and gurus to feel that they are in this roomand in our hearts because everything that we receive herereally comes through their blessings and our own inner receptivity so that s where we want our attentionto be on god and gurus well we have been told thatlife is really a howtolive school and we re blessedto have a wonderful teacher in our guruparamahansa yogananda and we have textbooksfull of divine wisdom in his writings and then there is alsothe laboratory part of the course as most of youhave already discovered studying guruji s teachings isvery much a matter of learning by doing and that s what the questionsin this morning s satsanga are about about taking his guidance and seeinghow we can put it into practice in the various kinds of situationsand challenges that arise in our daily livesand in our sadhana so our first questionis from a devotee who says lately one thing after anotherseems to be going wrong in my life i guess that sounds familiardoesn t it the company i work forhad to cut back and i lost my job now there are somany bills coming in and my husband isfacing some serious health problems it s just too much sometimes i find myself getting angry withgod for allowing these things to happen i know i shouldn t think that wayand i feel bad about it but sometimesit seems so unfair well in the challenging timesthat we are passing through i think so many people are facingthese kinds of circumstances and probably a number of youhave been in situations where you could wholeheartedlyagree with this statement which was made bya very saintly soul lord i know you won t give meanything i can t handle but i wish you didn ttrust me so much but when we re insuch a situation like that let s not add to our burdenby feeling bad about feeling bad because we don t need to getdown on ourselves just because we don t respond to every situationwith flawless evenmindedness that s human and perfection is not a prerequisitefor following the spiritual path that s a relief isn t it so we need to know that god and guruknow what we re going through and that they feel for us guruji himself had many financialuncertainties in building this work he went through manydifferent kinds of difficulties and so he knowswhat it s like and he has has also shown usthat our trials are not meant to make us feeldiscouraged or defeated on the contrary they are meant to bringout strength and inner understanding that we may not haveeven known we had guruji said you are immortalyour trials are mortal you can unleash infinite powersand shatter your finite trials sometimes we forget our infinite natureand we need to discover it again and that s reallywhat it s all about master said the magnificent painting of creation stretches across the infinitecanvas of time and space but from our present humanpoint of view how much of that paintingare we actually seeing maybe a square inchmaybe a little less and if you imagine yourself standingin front of a huge painting and only being ableto see one square inch is that going to makeany sense to you probably not becauseyou don t see what purpose that fragment hasin the whole picture and it s the same waywith our experiences we may not see what purpose they havein the overall life of our soul and in what ways they are meantto bring us closer to god so no wonder we re confused and when with our humanunderstanding alone we can t figure out why things are happeningthe way they are then what do we do well basicallywe have two choices we can resist and resent and sometimes that s our first reactionespecially if something feels unfair but if we go down that road sooner or later we find outthat it s a deadend street because you just get morediscouraged more frustrated and when that happensyou end up cutting yourself off from other peopleand from god you don t wantto do that to yourself so what isthe other alternative to put our trust in the onewho does see the whole picture to accept what has happened and to say all right lord i maynot like this i may not understand it but help me to go on help me to see what it isi need to learn and when we re hurtingit s not always easy to take that step ofsurrendering and trusting but it s absolutely vitalif we want to go forward because that swhat opens the door to all the helpand the blessings we need and that puts us in touchwith the source of all abundance of course it s not a matterof just saying a prayer once or twice we know that we need to really keep that connection with god openso that we can be receptive to his help and meditation is mostimportant in doing that an ironic thing is that sometimes whenwe are going through many difficulties that s the very time whenwe re tempted not to meditate or we re temptedto cut our meditation short we feel i m just too restless i m too worried i m too busy i just can t do it but that s the very timewhen we need it the most when we need that calmness and thatperspective that meditation brings and when we need that reassuranceof being connected with god that connection withthe source of our being and so promise yourself that whenyou re in this kind of situation you will take time to meditateno matter how restless you are guruji said since god is the source of allmental power peace and prosperity do not will and act firstbut contact god first having made that contactthen you can pull out all the stops and do whatever you need to doin daily life to solve those problems and that of courseincludes using our will and being willing to consider manydifferent options being creative about it and also absolutelyrefusing to give up master said no matter what happensif you have unalterably resolved the earth may be shatteredbut i will keep doing the best i can you are using dynamic willand you will succeed and you can just imagineguruji saying that to you with all the forceof his dynamic will one way to keep ourselvesfrom getting overwhelmed is to take one step at a time not brooding about the pastor worrying about the future too much just doing what needsto be done right now another way is toremember guruji s advice not to dwellon any problem constantly because what you dwellon all the time that becomes bigger and biggerin your consciousness so that s why it s much betterto practice the presence of god than the presenceof your problems so if we take these stepsif we trust god and if we put forthevery effort we can then we will get throughthese difficult times in our lives and we will find thatwe have grown through them it s pretty easy to be positivewhen everything s going well isn t it and it s easy to love god and to trusthim when our prayers are being answered but if we still try to do thateven in the midst of trials then we re learning someof the deepest lessons that there areon the spiritual path lessons in faithand in unconditional love and when you do that that takes you to a whole new levelin your relationship with god now having heard that you might think my goodness isn t there an easier way to learn whatwe need to learn actually no our president sri daya mataonce said strength will power faith all these muscles are developedwhen one is forced to use them so never think that if lifewere less difficult for you it would be easier to know godbecause that is not true and i read a little storythat reminded me of this it was about a biologistwho was working with butterflies and one day he was watchingan emperor butterfly trying to get out of its chrysalisand it was really struggling and he wonderedwhat would happen if he would helpthe process along a little bit so he slit open the chrysalis to makeit easier for the butterfly to get out and it emergedand it spread its wings and it drooped perceptiblyand then it died and the biologistcould only conclude that without the painand the intensity of the struggle that butterfly simply did not havethe strength to live to survive and it s reallythat way with us our trialshave a hidden purpose they are meantto bring out our strength and they are meant to draw uscloser to god to help us to be free as master tells ussuch experiences are but the shadow of divine mother shand outstretched caressingly don t forget that when trouble comesdon t think that she is punishing you her hand overshadowing youholds some blessing as it reaches outto draw you closer to her that s a comforting thoughtduring these times isn t it that divine motheris drawing us closer to her the next question is about somethingthat we never have enough of time this devotee says in the selfrealizationfellowship lessons guruji tells us to practice meditationlong and with intensity how can the average person who has toearn a living care for children and cope with many responsibilitiesmanage this how does one dealwith the limits on one s time imposed by the realitiesof life in a complex world i think we can all relateto what this devotee is saying because whether we arehouseholders or monastics many of us have multiple responsibilitiesand a pretty full schedule and sometimes we wonderwhy the lord didn t make the day at leasta few hours longer so that we couldget it all in but one thing we need to remember whenwe read anything in guruji s writings is that he often spoke ofwhat would be ideal for us to do and he certainly wanted to set ourhearts on fire to meditate more at the same time he wasvery balanced and very practical and he wants us to do whatis feasible within our own circumstances without neglecting our daily duties or without neglectingour family responsibilities and it s reassuring that his teachings are actuallya special dispensation for this age so they are meant to give usthat assurance that in spite of the many demandson our time we can find god now he didn t sayit would be easy he said we wouldhave to work at it but one thing he would wantevery single one of us to remember and that is nothing external can everprevent you from knowing god if what we needed right now was an unlimited timeto meditate so that we might makethe quickest spiritual progress then we would bein a himalayan cave but the fact thatwe are here instead indicates that there s something in ourpresent circumstances that we need in order to gain spiritual strengthand to progress on the spiritual path so if we can look at it that wayrather than thinking of it as an obstacle then we will makethe quickest progress as guruji told us god counts generously the meritsof the devotee s heart and striving so amidst all ofthe stresses of daily life how do we go about finding enough timefor god enough time for meditation well first of allwe can think about are there some waysi can simplify my life now that doesn t meanyou become a recluse and cut out all recreationand relaxation and so on because that s partof the balanced life too but maybe we need to look atsome of the fillers in our life to ask ourselves do i watch too much tv or do i get too engrossedin the internet or do i may be have a habitof just taking on too many things more than i can possibly do if you really make a list you willprobably find that there are things that you can cut outor that you can cut down on in order to have more timefor the vital priorities in your life another point to keep in mindis that it s quality time that counts quality time counts with peopleand it also counts with god so maybe we need to worry lessabout the time that we don t have and instead to think more about howwe can best use the time that we do have in order to really giveour undivided attention to god one way is to get holdof the mind right away before it has a chanceto wander off guruji said my mind used to be very restless but now it is just like fire as soon as i put my mind at thechrist center all thoughts are gone breath heart and mindare instantly still and i am awareonly of spirit as soon as i put my mind at thechrist center all thoughts are gone that s what we are aiming for and even if we haven t reachedthat state of perfect concentration yet we can start where we are byas soon as we meditate making sure that we consciouslyset aside those other concerns and that we don t allowthose other thoughts in and it takes an act of willuntil it becomes natural to you daya mataji has told us it is vital that youso discipline yourself that simply by using your will poweryou can throw out of your mind every mundane preoccupationand say truly nothing existsfor me now but god isn t that what we would do if we weremeditating with master even for a few minutes so make your meditationyour appointment with him it s important too that we notunderestimate what we can gain by making the most of the short periodsof time that we have available sometimes we may tend to havean allornothing consciousness and we think well i only have ten minutes and i really can t go deep in tenminutes anyway so it s not worth trying actuallyit s very much worth it you d be surprised how deepyou can go in just a few minutes if you really givethat time to god and sometimes we focuseven more intently when we know that all we haveis just a little bit of time and those few minutescan be crucial in helping us to keep regularityin our spiritual routine even at those times whenour schedule is very very pressed and that s importantbecause with the meditation techniques in a way it s just like practicingan instrument a musical instrument if you stay away from it completelyfor a couple of weeks and then you come back to it againit feels like you re starting all over and you have to work upto that same point again isn t that what happens withour meditations when they get sporadic and so using thoseshort periods of time and really being creativeabout looking for them that can help you to keepthat spiritual momentum going and to really experiencethe benefits that come from thatregular contact with god another way that we can learn to communewith god despite a less thanideal schedule is to practice his presence we know that guruji lived in thatconsciousness and he also told us cultivate the willto think of god during activity it only takes a moment to say i love you or thank you lord or to say help me bless me we just have toremember to do it and you can use whatever worksfor you either a brief affirmation or some some of the wordsof a favorite chant or even as guruji said just saying the name of god creates avibration that evokes the presence of god and don t worry if youdon t feel anything at first it s something that you needto practice and get used to and then it becomes easier and if you do thatduring the day you will find that when you get to yourmeditation in the evening your mind will alreadybe there with god you won t have to bring it backfrom a million miles away the great seventeenthcenturysaint brother lawrence practiced the presence of god to suchan extent that he got to the point where he didn t feelany difference whether he was kneelingat the altar in the monastery chapel or if he was in the kitchenpicking up a straw from the floor and the blessings of practicingthe presence of god are not just for great saintsand those who live in monasteries they have been experiencedby people of every walk of life who havepracticed it sincerely i remember reading about someone whodecided to practice the presence of god as he was commutingto work on the train and he started outwith just ten minutes it took a while for him to get used to it and then he graduallyincreased the time until finally he was ableto do it for the entire commute which was close to an hour and the first time hewas able to do this he said that when he got to thedestination he felt such inner joy that he had to pray lord please help me to get my feet onthe ground again i have to go to work so there are ways to keepour consciousness with god it doesn t so much matterwhat we re doing or where we are but where the mind is he is everywhere and this challenge of findingtime to meditate and to think of god is certainly not a new one and we each have to findthe balance that works for us daya ma once brought this same issueto our guru when she was a young disciple she said i remember gurujistanding in the hallway upstairs giving me many instructionsas to what he wanted done and he concluded by saying and don t forget to meditate and she says i said masterhow on earth can i do it how can i keepmy mind with god i expected some profoundmiraculous flow of wisdom from his lips but all he said to me was yes i understand i said the same thingto my master and he said to methe same thing i say to you you have to keep on trying you have to keep on yearningto keep on wanting and that s what he wouldsay to each one of us we have to keep trying we have tokeep yearning we have to keep wanting and we need to keepthat desire for god alive by making use of the timethat we do have and by keeping him closein our thoughts the next questionis from a devotee who says people sometimes tell methat i am taking myself and life in generaltoo seriously but it is hard not to especially when there s so muchto be concerned about in the world i have been told thati should lighten up how do i learnhow to do that well we know that there s plentyto be concerned about in the world but our trouble is usually that weget so identified with the whole drama and especiallywith our own part in it that everything becomesweighty and momentous and we start feeling like we re carryingthe whole world on our shoulders and then when that happens and something doesn t go accordingto plan we get really upset and so if we findthat happening to us then it may be that our perspectiveneeds some adjusting i recall that over the years whenever some challengingsituation has arisen in master s work daya mataji stypical reaction is well it s your show lordi m just doing the best i can she always puts fortha thousand percent effort but she never forgets who s in charge and she has also shared with ussomething that she read that is a little reminderof what the lord might say to us if he were to put his guidanceon this subject in writing do not feel totally personallyirrevocably responsible for everything that s my job and it s signed love god our job is just to do the best we canin our own little corner of the world to brighten it up as much as we canby positive thoughts and loving actions prayer for othersand faith in god and when we arein a tight spot rather than getting all angry and upsetor embarrassed about it sometimes we need to justbe able to laugh at ourselves and this is whatdaya ma has called letting the ego hangmore loosely around the soul and in order to do that we have to have some emotionaldistance from what s going on don t we if you ve ever been in a playor even in a little skit and the characterdoes something absurd or gets into some kind of predicamentyou don t go to pieces over it because you know that you rejust playing a part in a play well that s what we reactually doing all the time so if we find ourselves overreactingmaybe we need to say is it really worthgetting so worked up over this or do i maybeneed to just let go and even to be able to seethe humorous side of it it s easier on our nervous system and onour family and friends if we can do that god does have asense of humor you know and sometimesthe joke is on us i remember something thathappened a number of years ago when i was going for the first time asan assistant to one of the senior sisters who was going to give a sunday serviceat one of our meditation centers my own assignment was a fairlylight one since it was my first time i was supposedto play the harmonium and also lead the energization exercisesbefore the saturday evening meditation and i thought i can handle that and i was looking forward to quitea relaxed and inspiring weekend well everything went accordingto plan until sunday morning and then the sister who was going togive the service was unable to do it and because i was the only othermonastic there i was invited to step in that was a majormental adjustment especially since i hadnever given a service before and i had heard oncethat master had told daya ma in the car on the wayto one of his services that she would besaying a few words and i remembered thinking it s such a good thing that thingslike that don t happen anymore well i was wrong divine mother playeda little joke on me and fortunately i was ableat least to some degree to see the humorous sideof that rather improbable situation and that helped me to relax enough tocarry on and to do what needed to be done so this world is supposed to bea drama of cosmic entertainment and if we lookat it that way and are able to sometimeseven laugh at ourselves it helps in coping with therather unpredictable nature of it one of you has asked i work in an environmentthat can be quite negative at times how does one deal with difficultpeople and conditions well we know how much master speaks aboutthe importance of environment and the influence of it and those of uson the spiritual path especially yearn for a harmoniousand a godcentered environment but we live in an imperfect worlddon t we and especially during these timeswhen so many people are in stressful circumstances sometimes we do notice that there isa certain amount of negativity discouragement anger sometimes an everyoneforthemselves kind of consciousness but whatever our surroundingsguruji has urged us not to let ourselves be limitedor bound by them he said don t let anythingor anyone control you if you see that your situation isextremely detrimental to your wellbeing and you haven t been ableto improve it then you may need to think aboutfinding some other kind of work if that s an option for you and on the other hand if the situationis not ideal but it s tolerable you may feel well i m lucky just to have a job i need to hold on to it and if that s the case there are waysthat you can counteract that environment for example try not to takeyour work problems home with you leave them behind as much as possibleat the end of the day and do what helps you to relaxthe body and the mind and seek out harmonious environmentsas much as you can and it s also goodto seek out spiritual company if you have the optionof attending a temple or a meditation groupin your area that can help so muchto remind us that there is anotherdeeper reality besides just what s going onin daily life but what s especially important is the attitude that we taketoward our situation now we can spend a lot of time getting all upset because other peopledon t behave as they should and sometimes we re right but we can t really change anyone elsecan we we can t make them change the one person we can changeis our self what should my attitude behow should i act and if some kind of situationhas come to us there s a reason for it there s something we are meant to learnfrom that environment and grow stronger through it one of the lessons that can comethrough a difficult environment is developing the will and the courageto follow our own conscience we don t have to be a chameleonand take on the color of our environment for example if others are gossiping we don t need to contributeto that or if someone s very argumentative we don t need to respondin the same way or if someone s cutting cornersin their work we can follow our own principles it doesn t mean that we become criticalor holier than thou there are ways to be understandingand accepting of people but without compromisingour principles and something else we can learnfrom a challenging environment is just how not to be too sensitive guruji has told us something about thisfrom his own experiences as a boy he said in my youthi was very sensitive and consequentlythe one who suffered most was myself because i was so sensitive others seemed to take delight in getting my goat and he explains don t let anyone get your goat your goat is your peace let no one take that away and master found that the more he arguedwith the other boys who were criticizing him the more satisfactionthey got out of it and he discovered that if he didn t reactthen they stopped taunting him so that s a good principle to rememberisn t it sometimes we just care too muchabout what people think of us i remember one occasionwhen daya mataji was talking about some general spiritual principles and she saidwith a great deal of emphasis it s not good to be too sensitivebecause that only feeds the ego and at that timei had been dwelling on something that i realized fell into the categoryof being too sensitive and so i thoughti better pay attention to this and then later that same evening i just happened topick up one of her books and opened it to these words we should overcome that sensitivitywhich induces hurt feelings if our feelings are easily wounded it simply means we are cateringto our ego so the lord has waysof reminding us just in case we didn t get itthe first time so the bottom line iswe need to be less concerned about what others are thinking of us and more concerned aboutwhat god thinks of us that s really what matters most another lesson that can come froma difficult environment is broadening our empathyand understanding of people now we may not agree withsomeone s behavior and we may even make a mental notenot to imitate it but if we can see themas a soul and if we can realizethey have their own struggles and their own insecurities somehow that helps us to takewhat they do less personally we realizeit s not just about me guruji has said thatwe should not condone wrong actions but he also urged usnot to condemn the wrongdoer better to pray for thembecause they need our prayers and if you re finding it difficultto feel charitable towards someone to say lord help me to feelyour love for that soul when we pray in this way we are not only helping them we are alsouplifting our own consciousness and that brings usto one of the most important points guruji has made about environment he says whatever be the circumstancesof one s environment it consists of both an inner worldand an outer world the outside world is the one in which your life engagesin action and interaction the world inside of you determinesyour happiness or unhappiness the outer worldis not always under our control but the inner world is we can choose what thoughtswe entertain so the best wayto make ourselves invulnerable in an outwardly challengingenvironment is to keep the mindwith god to take him to workwith you as master told us think of god as your environment be one with godand nothing can harm you and when you re in thatconsciousness then you will knowhow best to handle every situation the next question is also abouthuman relationships one of my close relatives who has hadsome difficult experiences in life has been holdingmuch resentment in his heart so i told him what master saysabout the importance of forgiveness as a result my relationship with himhas become very strained what can i do about this well many of us have family memberswho are not following these teachings and because we ourselveshave so much benefited from master s principles of living we naturally want to share themwith our loved ones especially if we see that they re havingdifficulty with something and we may think now if they just understoodthis one point then it would be so much easierfor them and we may very well be right but the trouble isthey may not be ready to hear it master cautioned againstgiving advice unless someone asks for itor shows some sign of receptivity first of all because people generally don tlike to be told what to do or what to think as you may have found out throughpersonal experience and secondly the spiritual pathis very individual it s a very personal matter and we usually have to discoverspiritual truths in our own timeand in our own way if someone s having difficultyforgiving they may need to get to a pointwhere they realize my resentment is hurting meit s eating me up from inside and then they may be readyto look at ways to free themselves so if a person expresses interestthen we can certainly refer them to guruji s writings and to let them knowwhat we ve found helpful ourselves but if someone is not interested then it s best just not to let itbecome an issue to relate to the personwhere they are now and to accept them and treat themwith kindness and love that s what guruji did those of you who have seen the filmglimpses of a life divine may remember a manwho was not a disciple of guruji but he respected him very much and he said of him he gave me not religionnot philosophy he gave me unconditional love that s what changes peoplelove changes people more than anything and giving loveeven in little ways it can help to bridge that gap whenyou don t see eyetoeye with somebody when my family had difficultywith my interest in entering the ashram i remember we reached a pointwhere words alone did not help very much and no matter how deeplyi wanted them to understand i couldn t talk them into it i couldn t make it happen just by trying to convince them what helped mostwas just to listen to them to try to understandwhat they were feeling to give lovein whatever ways i could whatever little thoughtful thingsi could do for them and also to pray for them and in time they did begin to acceptand understand more what i was doing so people yearn to be understood and that may be the case with the personmentioned in this question if somebody s carrying a lotof resentment they are probably also carryinga lot of hurt if they feel heardif their pain is acknowledged and if they feelthat we are not judging them then they may be opento what we have to say we can t necessarily changesomeone s views by our words but we can love themand we can pray for them and we can also keep strivingto express guruji s ideals in our own behavior sri gyanamata wrote some very helpfuladvice to a devotee about this point she said whenever you are involved in an unpleasant situationwith another person i believe the best way of handlingthe matter is to decide what ought i to dohow ought i to act then concentrate wholeheartedlyon living up to your decision putting the other person and their actionsentirely out of your mind and she said whenever i have lived up to this rule i have met with surprising success and she mentioned that whenever she triedto change the other person nothing resulted except inharmony she said i maintain that holdingmy own consciousness on a high plane is of first importance if i take care of thateverything else will fall into place if our family members see us changingfor the better and becoming more calmand kind and understanding then they are more likelyto say i want to knowwhat it is that you re doing this next question is one that many of us might have askedat one point or another i have been meditatingfor a number of years but from time to timemy mind still gets very restless and i have trouble concentrating do you have any advicethat could help me well for anyone who faces that challengeyou sure have a lot of company i think we can all relate to that everyone who tries to meditate deeply has those periods of strugglewith the restless mind it s just that our energy and attentionare used to going outward and it takes time and patienceto bring that under control and also our concentrationis affected by things that are going on in our livesor things that are going on in the world so don t be discouraged just keep making that effortand you will progress the whole science of kriya yogais meant to help us interiorize the mind and you will find that it worksif you keep practicing it especially if you do it with reverenceand with the feeling that this is a direct link withgod and guru s blessing these are not just exercises the hongsau technique is especially vitalin learning to control the mind but since you ve already had a classon that we won t go into this but we will just mentionsome of the general points that perhaps can help usto be less restless one of the common problems that devoteesstruggle with in their meditations is physical and mental tension and as long as there s tension we knowthat the energy is tied up in the muscles and it can t go within and we can help to relievethat tension by taking balanced care of all aspectsof our body mind and soul guruji has given a number of ways to keepthe body freer of restlessness and that of course helpsthe mind too one of these is physical exercise he always encouraged the devoteesno matter how engrossed or busy they might bein their daily work assignments in the evening he would have themgo outside and exercise so that s very helpful he also stressed breathing deeplyin the fresh air for example when one is walking that brings oxygen into the bodyand it also helps to calm the mind he also emphasized practicing the energization exercisesmorning and evening and he did that very regularly himselfeven though he was in a state of consciousnesswhere he really didn t need to but he set that example for usbecause he felt it was that important and keeping our diet balancedalso helps the body not having too many foodsthat have a lot of toxins for example too much sugar maybe going a little easier onthe chocolate chip cookies and ice cream but if we want to concentrate better we also need to free ourselvesfrom mental tension and perhaps that is the morechallenging part isn t it and one thing that contributesto that tension especially during these timesis the constant input that we have it s all of the sources of stimulation the amount of informationthat s coming to us the sensory stimulation comes from all directionsvoicemail email internet tv cell phonesipods and so forth and of course these inventionsall have their usefulness but we don t want themto take over our lives i think we all needsome time just to be quiet for example to be out in naturewithout being plugged in to anything so that the mindand the nervous system and the body just have a chance to have a breakfrom all of that input another major source of restlessnessis worry and fear that puts a lot of strainon the mind and heart so if we find that we re becominga divine worrier instead of a divine warrior then we may need to think how can i reduce that load on the mind and one way is just to dothe best we can in the present and let god take care of the pastand the future more one of the nuns told meshe always tries to live by the principle this one thing i do and that appliesalso to our meditations sometimes we think how am i gonna be ableto concentrate for a whole hour but instead think let me just holdmy mind steady on this technique just for this one moment and then the next moment so that you re learning to concentrateone moment at a time so the more we can keep our bodyand mind relaxed overall the better we will be ableto concentrate and when i ve neededto remind myself to relax i ve found so helpful these wordsof master if you have peacein every movement of your body and peace in your thinking peace in your will power peace in your love and peace and godin your ambitions you will know that you have connectedyour life with god so as you go about your activitiesthis week think about that do i have peacein every movement of my body and peace in my thinking and peace in my will powerand my love just saturate your whole beingwith that peace and then take that intoyour meditations if we re going to learnto be less restless we also need to be patientdon t we and that s a quality that s maybenot too much cultivated these days because we live inan instantsatisfaction society and that s one of the things that comes upso often in our spiritual efforts that people feel impatient when am i going to get the wonderful resultsthat guruji talks about in the lessons but it s a gradual process have you ever sat downand tried to watch a tree grow well if you did you would bepretty frustrated very quickly but if you take care of that treeyou see how over a number of years it becomes so beautifuland majestic and it s the samewith our spiritual efforts we don t knowhow much is taking place inwardly when it seems like nothingis happening and another aspect of that patienceis not to give up even when we feelwe may not be getting results everyone has those dry periods sometimeswhen it s harder to meditate harder to love god i remember going throughone of these periods some years ago which lasted a number of months and when we came to the alldaychristmas meditation that year i was deeply prayingthat there would be a change and i went to the meditationwith much hope and determination to make every effort and still for many hoursit was an uphill battle with the mind and then during the final hourof the meditation a sense of peace and wellbeingcame over me that was deeper than i had feltin some time it was as if some hidden obstaclehad been removed and that experiencehas always reminded me that no matter what we may thinkof our efforts even if we don t thinkwe re progressing god receives those effortsand he will respond in factguruji said eventually if you keep tugging at that chainwhich holds you to mortal consciousness some day a divine handwill intervene and snap it apart and you will be free our final question is on introspection could you talk a little bitabout introspection master emphasizes howimportant it is but sometimes i get discouragedwhen i try to introspect i think about all the mistakesi ve made all the habitsi haven t overcome yet then i feel i m not measuring upto master s ideals and that he must be displeasedwith me well we need to rememberthat introspection is meant to be a tooland not a whip it s meant to help us takean honest look at ourselves so we can seewhat we need to change but it is not meantto make us dwell on our flaws that s really counterproductive because it only makes us identifymore with them we are not our flawswe are the ever perfect soul and that s whatwe want to dwell on if we re going to introspect effectively the mind needs to be calmand not embroiled in our experiences guruji has told us to look at lifefrom the balcony of introspection i ve always liked that imagebecause it gives a sense of objectivity of an overview and he also refers to introspection as the ability to stand aside to observe oneself without any prejudiceand judge accurately now sometimes we may not likewhat we see and that s normal but actually acknowledging a flawis the first step toward overcoming it so we don t wantto get discouraged we don t want to get intothat line of thinking of oh i m the only one that makesthese kinds of mistakes nobody else does it you actually have more companythan you think i remember on one occasion there was a devotee who was beratingherself for making a mistake and daya ma said to her so you made a mistakewell join the rest of the human race making mistakes is a universal experiencei think we all know that and it s not the mistakesin themselves that keep us from progressing spirituallyor from progressing in any area of life it s what we do with them whether we deal with themconstructively and i remember a little incidentthat made me think about how to approach mistakesin a constructive way it took place fairly early in my lifein the ashram and when we re newat something it s easy to dothe wrong thing sometimes and we all know how it is that when we are trying so hardnot to make a mistake that s exactly when we are more likelyto make one and it was during one these periodswhen i was somewhat mistakeconscious that daya ma gave mea little porcelain figurine and she said this is for youas a reminder of your life here and i looked at itand it was a little child praying and i thought oh how sweet and then i took it to my deskand i looked at it more closely the little child was praying but he was also standingin the middle of a puddle of spilled ink and he was looking up at heaven with an expression that said unmistakably oh lord what have i done now and the caption read i am in a spot lord so it reminded meas i said earlier that sometimeswe do need to lighten up a little yes we want to take to heartthe lessons we need to learn but not to get so emotionally involvedin our mistakes that it inhibits our effortsto change and more importantly if we ve madean error we should never hesitate to go to god and guruand ask their forgiveness and ask themto help us do better next time that s part of following throughon our introspection never think thatthey are going to judge you because that s just not true when i looked at that little figurineof that child who had spilled the ink my reaction wasn t oh it s so terriblehe spilled that ink rather it was well he s made a real mess but he s quite lovable anyway and i ve had a feeling of empathyfor that little child and that s how god feels for us he knows when we ve slipped up but he also sees all the good the strivingand the potential that we have to change and do better we know that whenever guruji had to scolda disciple for something as soon as they showed that they understoodwhat they needed to learn he was just as loving as alwaysnever mentioned it again so he doesn t hold anythingagainst us all that god and guru wantis that we learn from our experiences they accept us just as we areand they see what we can become and so we need to forgive ourselvesand accept ourselves too and the next step in following throughon our introspection is to go forwardand leave the past behind remember what sri yukteswartold master forget the past everything in future will improveif you are making a spiritual effort now so the key word is now that s our window of opportunity for taking our lifein a different direction for making amendsor for changing our habits if we keep going backto the past and feeling guilty and regrettingand so on it s like driving a carwith the brakes on you re expending a lot of energyand youre not getting anywhere and you re feeling very frustrated so that s why it s so important to feel that the pastdoesn t belong to you anymore put it behind youforget it master summarizes so beautifullyin his teachings the way to overcomeour human weaknesses and the pull of delusionin general and that is not to focuson our flaws but to focus on god and in order to absorbthese words better let s just close our eyesand listen to what he says the easiest wayto overcome finiteness is to give oneself completelyto god with the totality of one s faultsand one s virtues how quickly whatever is negativewithin one s character is resolved by love of god love in a most wonderful way transforms and spiritualizeswherever it appears when we give our love to godwholeheartedly we open our heartto receive his blessings so let s turn to himwithout any sense of distance or fear and practicethe following affirmation to remind ourselves of how muchwe are loved and cherished by him i ll read it once and thenwe ll repeat it o fountain of lovemake me feel that my heart is floodedby thine omnipresent love o fountain of love make me feel that my heart is flooded by thine omnipresent love o fountain of love make me feel that my heart is flooded by thine omnipresent love so take that thought with you and feel and keep god and guruin your heart throughout this week and beyond and you will feel their love and you will knowthat they are responding to you jai gurujai ma jai ma,1.0
be kind inspirational amp motivational video,we are called to be kind when we show kindness to others the impact it has can change their lives acts of kindness show the,i want to focus on that wonderful concept that vital virtue that unfortunately and regrettably is often forgotten the virtue of kindness being kind i want you to hear a story years ago i drove a cab for a living when i arrived at in the morning the building was dark except for a single light in a groundfloor window under these circumstances many cab drivers would just honk once or twice wait a minute then drive away but i had seen too many impoverished people who depended on taxis as their only means of transportation to drive away unless the situation smelled of danger i always went to the door so i walked to the door and knocked just a moment answered a frail elderly voice after a long pause the door opened a small woman in her s stood before me by her side was a small nylon suitcase would you carry that this bag out to the car for me she said i took the suitcase out and returned to assist the woman she took my arm and walked slowly toward the curb she kept thanking me for my kindness its nothing i told her i just try to treat all my passengers the way i would want my mother treated when we got in the cab she gave me an address then she said oh by the way could you drive through downtown its not the shortest way oh i dont mind im in no hurry im on my way to a hospice i looked in the rearview mirror and her eyes were glistening i dont have any family left she said almost to herself the doctor says i dont have very long i quietly reached over shut off the meter what route would you like me to take for the next two hours we drove all around the city she showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator we drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds she had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl sometimes she had asked me to slow down in front of a particular building or corner she would sit staring into the darkness saying nothing as the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon she suddenly said okay im ready lets go now we drove in silence to the address she had given me it was a low building two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up they were solicitous and intent watching her every move they were expecting her i opened the trunk took out the small suitcase carried it to the door the woman was already seated in a wheelchair how much do i owe you she asked no you dont owe me anything i said oh you have to make a living she answered their other passengers i responded almost without thinking i bent over and gave her a hug she held on to me tightly you gave an old woman a little bit of joy she said thank you i squeezed her hand and walked into the dim morning light behind me a door shut it was the sound of the closing of a life i drove aimlessly lost in thought for the rest of the day i could hardly talk what if that woman had gotten in and an angry driver earlier that morning our one who was impatient what if i had refused to take the run or at hawked once and driven away on a quick review i dont think i have done anything more important in all my life i love that story sort of helps me allow life to make up its mind again you need to remember that story the times you will want to be anything but kind because it is so much easier to bear a grudge and hate in return or get back or get even hate destroys the vessel its kept in revenge never healed a wound theres one thing all of us have in common weve been mistreated by somebody some of you have known abuse misunderstanding and all of this has a way of siphoning your tank of kindness it can make you hard and you can get on with hard you can get along with it fact some will even respect you more because youre tough but i urge you not to be be kind tenderhearted forgiving one another when im truly free of revenge and bitterness there is plenty of room in my heart left for kindness and not until do whats right do justice love kindness walk humbly with your god maybe you were born a really nice person with a gentle sweet personality being kind to people comes pretty naturally to you but i think more of the globe is not that way than is and the good news is is we can change its amazing what one kind word can do we dont think anything about it but to the other person it breathes life into their spirit our words have the power to lift people to help them get through a challenge to push them into their destinies when you tell someone i love you im proud of you you did great on that project youre not just being kind those are healing words we dont know what people are going through they may smile on the outside but on the inside theyre hurting theyre lonely theyre discouraged many people have wounds from the past wounds from a relationship that didnt work out wounds from people trying to push them down just a simple word of encouragement i believe in you im praying for you a simple compliment you look beautiful today its no big deal to you but to them its helping heal the wounds its lifting their spirits its causing them to believe in themselves your words can be what keeps them moving forward and god puts people in our lives on purpose so we can bring healing letting people know that you care does more than you imagine you have the power to put someone on their feet you have the power to keep them from falling into depression you have the power to cause them to pursue their dreams be free with your compliments you can think well of your friend all day long but if you never tell them theyll never know god wouldnt have brought it up if he didnt want you to tell them he wouldnt have put that thought in you if the other person didnt need it you may not know them it may not make sense to you but god knows what hes doing theres a reason they need your healing dont withhold it dont try to reason it out in my early s a young man started coming up to the gym to play basketball with us he was a loner he was very unfriendly very cold he never talked even during the games he wouldnt interact with us most of the guys just ignored him but something down in here told me to reach out to him and make him feel welcome i found out that his name was bo when he would come into the gym i would go over and say hey bo its great to see you today he never said anything he just hit his chest twice and walked away i didnt know what that meant but i hit my chest twice and walked away this went on for several years i saw him four or five times a week well i stopped playing basketball there and i hadnt seen beau in over years one sunday he showed up at church i saw him afterwards i thought where do i know this guy from he said im bo we used to play basketball together thats the most ive ever heard him talk he went on to tell how he grew up in the projects at he started living on his own nobody wanted him he never felt loved or accepted he said one of the main reasons i went up to the gym was to hear you say great to see you today because nobody had told me that they were glad to see me those simple words letting him know that i cared were like lifegiving water today bo is married he introduced me to his children hes setting a new standard for his family what am i saying nobody is in your life by accident dont ignore what you feel on the inside that compassion to encourage them that desire to be their friend take time to make them feel loved doesnt have to be something big just good to see you i believe in you im praying for you just let them know that you care,1.0
walk by faith trust god even when you don t understand inspirational amp motivational video,we must walk by faith and trust that god has a plan faith is trusting god even when you dont know the details trust god,if i should ask you are you walking in faith are you walking by sight how would you answer that do you walk according to the will and purpose and plan of god for your life are you just walking trusting and hoping things will turn out god wants us to walk trusting him for every single thing and that is he desires that you and i walk by faith we either walk by faith or by sight most people they got to see it to believe it i think all of us have moments in life when we want to hear gods voice or receive some definite sign from him regarding a relationship perhaps a pending marriage a business decision a career choice or a major expenditure you know our decisions really matter we make decisions our decisions turn around and make us and we face so many questions throughout all of our lifetime like how about should i get married if the answer is yes who should i marry should i go to college ive got a good job shall i take the new job should i just hold on to the one i have is there any way to be certain about gods will when youre making a major choice in life or a college but remember we walk by faith not my sight and i want to say to you you are not going to get assurance and confidence before you make a choice because it would require zero faith we pray about it we wait on the lord and then we make our choice we believe what we dont see thats what faith is faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen once you see then you dont need faith anymore faith means you have it in your heart before you have it in your circumstance but it really can be just as good as having it if you really trust and believe god you have to take the plunge you have to make the choice go ahead and make the best decision you can make and when youve done that leave the results to god because gods purpose will stand and if yours are not he will correct it he will redeem it and he will still keep you on the right path to your future destiny and will not forsake you he wants you to know his will more than you want to know it and i think one of the reasons that people live out of the will of god is theyre not willing to take the first step god will say something and god will speak to the people say and i hear people tell me this all the time well god doesnt speak to me yes he does you may not be listening but he does god doesnt play favorites he loves us all but sometimes hell require of us something that doesnt make any sense whatsoever if im going to follow the lord ive got to be willing to listen to him and ive got to be willing to trust him when i dont understand it you may have some things you dont understand you cant figure out you dont see the answer thats okay you dont have to see it this is a key to faith trusting when you dont understand trusting when you dont have the answers trusting when it seems like just the opposite of what you were hoping for quit worrying about those things you cant figure out god has you in the palm of his hand i know not how this is going to work out but i do know whos on the throne i do know whos directing our steps i do know whos planned out our days before you were ever born god pondered plans he had for you before there was even a single day to your existence and he established your purpose before you were ever created in your mothers womb they were actually recorded or written in his book god has plans for me jeremiah verse the new living translation reads god says for i know the plans i know him i know the plans plural so he must have some plans plural ones i know the plans i have for you says the lord they are plans for good and not for disaster to give you a future and to give you a hope so god has great plans for you he promises that his plans for your destiny are only good ones no disasters are planned for you by god he hasnt written down on this occasion when theyre years old im gonna get them none of that no his plans are only good and theyre only filled with grace and hope youre not god he is i think that is really comforting to know you know there is a god and it aint me and thats why im hanging on to him and trusting him i think what happens is that we forget that he is in control of the life i gave him i do want to make good choices but im a limited human being i cant see the future but i can ive got scripture ive got prayer ive got wise people and then youve got a peace in your heart and at the end of the day i have to do that and trust god and i have to believe regardless of what happens he will orchestrate my life and ill end up where im supposed to be doing what im supposed to do i dont have to obsess hyperventilate or control everyone and everything around me i dont have to worry about the minutia the little miniature things of life i can have confidence that this god is going to take care of everything you know you can sleep well once you realize gods in control of your life i dont like everything i dont understand everything just like you but i do know hes in control and i know no human being energized by satan not even satan himself can stop the purpose of god for your life or mine and heres what ive noticed even if you trust god and make a mistake if you genuinely make a mistake god has the most awesome ways of correcting that mistake he knows your heart he knows youre willing to do or what he requires of you and god knows better than we do that some things he requires of us is very difficult but the question is are you listening and secondly are you trusting that whatever he says for you to do that youre to do abraham and im glad this is in the bible he made some wrong choices but god didnt stop blessing him he didnt cast him aside listen before god ever created anything in this life he knew that his finest children would make mistakes they would sin against him they would disobey him because living in the world in which you and i live in that we make mistakes the times of weakness the times of failure and god forgives and he keeps moving us he can put you exactly where he wants you to be he can arrange all the details of your life years in advance he can open doors that seems shut tight he can remove any obstacle that stands in your way he can take your choices and fit them into his plan so you end up at the right place at the right time he can even take your mistakes and bring good out of them dont forget hes our redeemer he redeems things he can take tragedy use it for your good and his glory all he needs is a willing heart just someone to reasonably cooperate this doesnt mean you wont have to make difficult and hard choices you will but it takes the pressure off because it means you can trust god to take your decisions your choices and use them to accomplish his will in your life proverbs and trust in the lord with all your heart lean not to your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path the steps of a good man are ordered or directed by the lord even when you dont know what the hecks going on hes directing them lay your head on your pillow knowing dads up hes in charge and hes going to govern the affairs of your life if he shuts the door and opens the door hes just directing you its going to be all right god loves you so much and hes got such a great blessed wonderful life for you hear me god has plans for you theyre awesome plans you have not maxed out your potential,1.0

minuteswhether it s an hour two hours take time to allow your mind separation from the stresses of your day if you expect to fail you will fail on the other hand if you expect to winyou will win and he s right because doctorsand psychologists both alike they agree that worrying actuallydoes shorten your life and it does damage your body we need to clear our thinkingbefore we go to sleep were talking about a book thatnorman vincent peal wrote the power of positive thinking let s kick this offwith golden nugget number one creating your own inner happiness that you are responsiblefor your own happiness because unhappiness is usuallythe byproduct of you thinking sad thoughts you having these negative feelings you having resentment towards others and just having an overallcrappy outlook on life so if you think those things what do you think is going to happen you have to force yourself to notthink those negative thoughts peal says we have to get intothe happiness habit by thinking upbeatcheery thoughts throughout the day we like to sit and dwell we like to sit in our own sadness i don t like to do that but i just know that sometimesmy brain forces me to do that and i don t know why so i have to force myself to not do that i have to put on upbeat music i have to do something productivei have to get in the gym i have to go hang aroundfriends that are gonna make me laugh and it s toughat first it doesn t feel right it feels like you re forcing itbecause you are forcing it but eventually it startsto make you feel better there are miracles happeningall around you there is beauty all around you open your eyes and look can you see the sun shining great can you hear the birds chirping great can you feel the warmthof the sun on your skin awesome there s simple beauties all around us if you want to start to feel happy it starts with you wanting to feel happy so short circuit those negative thoughts and when you start to feel badwhen you start to find yourself gossiping feeling guilty feeling angry feeling whatever it is you re feelingthats negative turn that around force yourself to think positively do positive things and while it doesn t feel right at first keep going you re on the right path golden nugget number two the antidote to anxiety is that people waste a lot of their timea lot of their energy fuming and fretting about thingsthat they cannot control go back to covey s principle circle of concern circle of influence focus only on those thingsin the circle of influence everything else in the circle of concernyou can t control you can t affect that so move on don t allow your mindto just spend time in that space you re wasting your mind s energy so as part of this antidote to anxiety peal says that we need to slow down to relieve our anxiety and to attain peace and he suggests meditation he suggests that we devoteat least minutes daily to calming and relaxing ourselves by thinking peaceful thoughts or not thinking anything at all so something he shares in the bookis to help get rid of the tendency to worry and get angry we need to relax and spend a few minutes thinking aboutbeautiful peaceful settings hearing the birds chirpingfeeling the sun on our face all these thingsthat i was talking about before where its just a matter of you actuallythinking that in your mind wherever you are if youre at work if youre in your house it doesnt close your eyes and open your mind to maybe a placewhere youre on vacation before and go there for minutes smell the smells feel what the sand feels like on your feet feel yourself plunging into the ocean so the antidote to anxiety its all about clearing your mind however you choose to do that make sure youre spending timeevery single day whether its minutes whether its an hour two hoursif youre working out at the gym whether youre doing yogawhether youre going to cycling class whatever take time to allow your mind separation from the stresses of your day golden nugget number three expect the best if you expect to fail you will fail on the other hand if you expect to win you will win so what seeds are you plantingin your mind are you planting seeds of positivityor seeds of negativity guess what your life is going to give you backmore of that are you planting seeds of oh doubt and oh i m not gonna make this work or something bad is gonna happen if youre planting seeds of that guess what youre gonna getmore of that start focusing on the positive start focusing on how things can go right and guess what when things go wrongsay hmm theres a lesson in that for me because life doesnt happen to meit happens for me so everything thats happening is there to teach me a lesson this isnt a setback its a set up this thing thats really badit happened for a reason im gonna learn from iti m gonna get better golden nugget number four worry not and hes right because doctorsand psychologists both alike they agree that worryingactually does shorten your life and it does damage your body we need to clear our thinkingbefore we go to sleep and we need to imagine our worries flowing out of our bodylike water out of a glass so dont think that my pathis the right path no no this path is good for me i replaced worry with hope by putting together goals i put together three goals a financial related goal a health related goal and a professional related goal something that what i was going to do with my life and back in the day wheni was going through those stresses i was worrying a lot a lot i was having a tough time sleepingi was having chest pains my heart was palpitating all the time and i really just could not get you know a high levelof satisfaction in life and you know if you were sayingon a scale of one to eight ryan again nines and tens are reserved for very special times in our livesthat seldom happen i was sitting at a four consistently where i would wake up and id all ofa sudden feel the stresses of the day id pass between three and fourall the time so what i did was to replace that worry that anxiety that fear i built myself a plan that gave me hope goals that gave me hope something that got me excited something that i wanted to work towards something i wanted to achieve because i knew that if i didit would get me out of this mess and my life would be better as a result golden nugget number five problem solving i had problems that i needed solutions to i had desires i had wants i had dreams i had goalsthat i needed a solution to the cut the crap show was a solution create your was a solution but what i did need to do was takemyself out of the busyness of the day and allow my mind to sort of free up and look for inspiration all around me and know that whatever solution i m looking forits going to come to me and this is where in this golden nugget in the book where pealtalks about you know problem solving he gives us problemsolvingtechniques which many of them im going to leave with the first one believe that for every problemthere is a solution so yes believe that your problemcan be solved yes its hard yes its difficultyes you dont have a solution right now but there is a solution and oftentimes theres more than one two try to maintain your serenityas you address a problem so dont feel anxious dont try todont try to to get angry and say ah you know i m not getting thisi dont understand no you need to be calm you need to be hopeful that theres going to be a solutionto this problem number three dont try to force an answer more so dont try to say like oh my god i need an answerby saturday at noon if i dont get it by saturday at noonthen its too late sometimes you cant force it life often happens for you and so you just need time for that to reveal itself to you number fourgather all relevant information pretty simple do as much research as possible number five write down all factsabout the situation again get an understanding forthe problem whats going on you need to get clarity on the problem so you can get clear onwhat solutions you need to solve it number six spend time praying about the issueyou are confronting listen if youre praying about itthats fine if youre not praying about itmaybe youre thinking about it always make time to think about it when youre walking in nature yes take time to think in natureand allow your mind to flow but when you separate yourself from the stresses the anxietiesthe busyness of the day allow your time to think about solutions number seven believe in and seek gods guidance on the promise of the rd psalm thou wilt guide me by thy counsel again if you believe in the religiousaspect of that that will talk to you that necessarily doesnt talk to me so i i maybe wont be using that one number eight rely on your inner giftsof insight and intuition theres things that we believe we should do and then theres things thatwe know we should be doing so you gotta listen to yourself but it takes time it takes it does take time it takes patienceit takes some maturity for you to realize what youre great at and sometimes youre doing somethingjust to make a living just because its my job its my career its what i believe im great at but you have other gifts within you that maybe youre not exploring yetthat you should be number nine attend religious serviceswhere you can and listen peacefully and letyour subconscious work on the problem again you can go to churchor you can just go for walks i love going for walks period i ll put music on my earsand allow myself to think pretty simple number ten the answerthat develops in your mind or comes to pass is the right answer so i just allowed the thoughtsthat came in my mind whenever i had a thought an inspiredthought i wrote it down on my phone pulled up my phone opened up the notepadand just wrote it down at the end of the day i wouldthink about it ponder on it and say you know what this idea issomething i want to go further into and dig deeper into that thats exactly how this show happened thats exactly how create your happened its exactly how youre going to findsolutions to your problems last but not least gold nugget number six how to handle heartache now everybody at some pointin their life experiences heartache and its tough and so peal says that for usto get over heartache we need to resist the heartacheby staying busy so if youre getting a divorcefrom your husband or your wife if you just broke up withyour girlfriend or your boyfriend if you just lost a loved one if a loved one passed away a friend a family member doesnt matter who it is he says that in order for you to getthrough it you need to stay busy you need to returnto your normal activities as soon as possible aftera loss or a defeat and you need to resistthe temptation to brood and feel sorry for yourself i gotta get back to work i gotta get back to my goalsget back in the gym get back to eating right get back to hanging out withmy friends my family listen to the musicthat i was listening to we have to return to life but sometimes we just have to be sad and we have to work our way through it but the key here is to not allow your mindto dwell on it for too long thats not handling heartache thats allowing heartacheto take control of you and to win,1.0
begin your day with god listen to this before you start your day morning inspiration,god is the source of our strength identity and purpose in life we must make god our first priority and make time for him every,the first thing you want to take care of every day lord bless me why so you can be a blessing keep me from the evil of the day keep me from the evil of the day every day you wake up you dont know what evil had been designed to try and take you down and trouble you so go ahead of it and say keep me from the evil of the day choose fellowship with god daily choose fellowship with god daily try to learn what pleases the lord and have nothing to do with the things done in darkness which are not worth anything walk with him walk with him for life let me ask you this is there anything in your life that you willing to be fully committed to for the rest of your life there might be things that your committed to right now thats taking your time and your energy and you shouldnt be committed to those because god wants first priority in your life and a whole heart commitment god says whats most important is that you be with me above everything else that you get to know me it means that when i wake up in the morning i need to say god no matter what happens today i need to get to know you a little bit more i need to learn how to love you a little bit more and it could be the best day i ever had but i need to make sure i learn how to love you and know you a little bit more and god says if you do that that day was a success and the opposite is true to lets say you get up and you dont even think about god and you got this great day you go you make the sale you finally get the job you finally get a date with a live girl whatever it is okay your a success that day its your best day ever that you got and you forget about god god says that day was a waste it was a failure because you forgot me whats most important is that you get to know the lord get to know him and its a mistake that you and i make all the time in our lives where we dont think about inviting god into our daily experiences we think god ive got this i got my dating dont worry about my dating ive got it god i know what im doing god dont worry about my work im good im good god dont worry about my work dont worry about my dreams god dont touch my dreams dont worry about them i got them and we totally rule out god am i going to put my faith in my own wisdom in my own power my own resources or am i going to trust god am i going to let god do the battle for me and trust his power and his provision in my life and the fact is that when we make that choice we need to know that god wants to do battle for us god wants to go before us in battle he wants to go with you in battle he wants to help you in your troubles and the problems that you have so whatever trouble your in whatever battle your in right now seek the lord seek his power he wants to give it to you prayer is a weapon of our faith it is one of the greatest weapons of our faith it should be our first response and not our last resort when we go through times of trouble call out to god and rely on him god wants you to know that he wants you to experience the fullness of his presence in your life not just every day of your life but every moment of your life you can experience his presence if you want it you can tap into it and thats the promise he gives us he promises his presence in our lives when we seek after him you may go through deep waters you will go through deep waters in your life but you will not drown you will go through storms in life and god will get you through those storms and when you go to battle you need to know that god wants to be there with you and protect you and you will not be destroyed one of the greatest truths of the bible is if god is for us who can be against us heres jesus invitation to you heres what he said in matthew jesus said come to me thats the seeking part come to me all you who are weary and carry heavy burdens all the things that are weighing you down heres his promise and i will give you rest let me teach you because i am humble and gentle at heart and you will find the rest for your souls and so what i can tell you with great honesty and sincerity is that if your in the desert your in the battle and youve been there for a long time and your going to be in it gods presence will be with you and he will protect you and he will give you the rest and ive found that if i have that that is all i need i dont have to have the answers i dont have to understand but if i got god and i feel him and know him he is there then i am good how do we need to make sure that we dont miss out on gods blessing when were seeking him well theres a familiar verse that gives us great direction its proverbs and it says this trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding and in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your paths this word trust means to not just trust him in the convenient ways not just in the easy ways not even in just the spiritual ways but trust him in all of the ways that we have in our lives in the big and the small trust him on the roads of life that youve been on before and trust him on the roads youve never been on and those paths youve never taken and those safari crazy roads were there is no path thats your out there in the middle of the wilderness on your own trust him this word acknowledge in here this word acknowledge means a deep intimate penetrating relationship where you know a person in the deepest and fullest sense thats the kind of relationship that god wants to have with you and with me so our life goal needs to be this that we need to seek god in every area of our life when we dont know what to do and we need to seek god when we do know what to do we need to seek him in the big things in the small things we need to invite him into the conversations we need to invite him into the daily life because yesterdays victories dont determine todays successes and even when you think you know how to answer the problem that your in you still need to go to god you still need to trust him because the greatest faith of yesterday will not give us the confidence of today unless we stay connected to god because he wants to bless our lives god wants to have his best for your life he wants to have his hand on your life he wants to give you the protection and his presence and rest and hope and all the things that he wants to do for you he wants that second chronicles says the eyes of the lord search the whole earth they search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whos hearts are fully committed to him this verse that god is searching he is looking he is seeking the entire earth for somebody for a people for a person for a church thats willing to be fully committed to him so that he can bless them and have his hand on them and give you and give me his best he is seeking after you god wants us to seek him but he is seeking us he is seeking us because he loves us and he wants to give you his best we need to do our responsibility and then cast our care you do what you can do about the things in your life that you can do something about and then when you cannot do anything about it you cast it on god and you trust him and its perfectly okay for you to enjoy you life while you have a problem i said it is perfectly okay for you to go ahead and enjoy your life while while god is working on your problem its not that nothing happening its just that your not the one thats making something happen so whatever you got going on in your life tonight dont waste one more day in excessive sadness and grief and depression and discouragement because you cant do anything about it and jesus paid for you to be able to enjoy your life to have it in abundance to the full until it overflows so we are totally wasting what god gives us if we waste our days in sadness and morning learn how to focus on good things everybody here has got something they could be upset about if they choose to focus on it but you dont have to focus on that and what we focus on is what we magnify in our lives what we talk about is what we become more consciously aware of in our lives if theres a problem that needs to be dealt with deal with it but dont focus on it think about the possibilities in your life not the problems in your life hebrews very simple says looking away from all that will distract unto jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith learn how to celebrate the good instead of grieving excessively over the bad things in life no matter where you started in life you can have a good finish it doesnt really matter where you began you have got a good finish coming lets have a shift in our thinking lets have a shift in what were focusing on surly you can find something in your life to focus on thats worth celebrating and were going to be excited about the things that are yet to be done that we know that god is working on and that god is doing,1.0

self love positive morning motivation listen every day,self love positive morning motivation listen every day speakers tyrese gibson les brown oprah winfrey mel,how much do you love yourself because if you understand the value of selflove youll never be friends with those types of people most of the people that are here are running around empty they have no sense of self no sense of selflove when i say self love it has nothing to do with celebrity money materialistic things and all of the things that your negative mind could probably go to has nothing to do with self love has nothing to do with looks nothing to do with cars and any of the superficial things that one would assume that can make you love yourself even more its a matter of knowing your value its a matter of you saying i dont have to be around these people in these type of environments and situations in order for me to finally see the value in myself i love me independent of you loving me i believe in me i know myself worth i am here and i have a purpose there is no value in having wisdom knowledge inside spirituality love every day i am a work in progress a person who can forgive nothing as a person is totally destroyed psychologically and emotionally forgive your parents forgive any relationship that you ever had that didnt work out forgive everyone else in your life that has ever hurt you in any way forgive yourself forgiveness is giving up the hope that the past could be any different i think for myself and i know many of you you think forgiving means accepting what has happened to you well it is accepting that it has happened to you not accepting that it was ok for it to happen it is accepting that it has happened and now what do i do about it forgiving is giving up the hope not holding on hoping wishing that it could have been any other way than it actually was giving up the hope that the past could be any different and when i got that i think it took me to the next level of being a better person because i dont hold grudges for anything or any situation and neither should you its letting go so that the past does not hold you prisoner does not hold you hostage see life is cyclic youre not what is extreme whatever experience youre having right now it not come to stay it has come to pass not to stay just to pass its just going through the biggest challenge is to know whats happening this is a part of this thing we call life this too shall pass and maintaining perspective putting it in perspective you have to be willing to break from the past to have the future you so desperately desire you have to have the courage to allow yourself to honor the past as it was to forgive those who need to be forgiven to forgive yourself and to acknowledge that everything led you to this point now everything let it go and begin to focus on developing myself and i say to you youre going to have people to do things to you things are going to happen to you and the most important thing to do is to harness your will and let it go and move so you can grow so you can get on with your life it doesnt matter about what happens to you what matters is what are you going to do about it what are you going to do now les but if you want to begin to move into your own personal greatness if you want to begin to really enjoy a happy successful healthy life youve got to be willing to go against the tide youve got to be willing to harness your will so as you in the process of reinventing your life write a description of the kind of person that you want to be what are the things that you must overcome what qualities about your personality you know that youre going to have to change because those particular characteristics are liabilities to you what are you assets what are your strong points look at and evaluating yourself to make that determination we need some coaching find some trusted critics people that you know care about you love you says somethings that keeps us from growing and getting out of ruts we take it personal when someone wants to give us some feedback on where we are falling short and tell us about our blind spots we want to have everything being positive about us were not perfect its it hurts i have a friend whos a crusted critic i dont like him but i love him he doesnt tell me the things i want to hear he tells me what i need to hear so i can grow it hurts it hurts when he put me on the hot seat i cant standed but that the only way that i can grow and im glad that he loves me enough to risk our friendship to tell me what i need to hear not what i want to hear,1.0
start fresh every day wake up with a positive attitude morning inspiration to motivate your day,start every morning with a positive attitude this is the day the lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it let us wake up each,you know we just we just need to make a decision i am not going to waste one more day of my life being miserable be happy today you know it puts a smile on gods face when were happy if you have children you know you love to see them happy nobody wants to see their children miserable and god doesnt want to see us miserable i think one of the things that we can do for him is serve him with gladness thats what psalm says serve the lord with gladness if you dont know what your purpose is yet just start with well im going to serve the lord with gladness and hell lead you into other good things and every morning when we wake up we need to empty out anything negative from the day before somebody offended you at work they didnt treat you right its easy to let that offense stay feels good to carry around a grudge you have to be disciplined say no i am not giving this offense any room i am not going to let it sour my day they hurt you once dont let them continue to hurt you by holding on to the offense being offended is not harming them its harming you its taking up space you need for the good things that move you toward your destiny or you wake up in the morning and thoughts of worry come how are you going to pay your bills what if the medical reports not good youll never get out of this problem dont allow that in dont make the mistake of dwelling on it just say no thanks i know gods in control hes got me in the palm of his hand hell get me to where im supposed to be take inventory of what youre giving space to life is too short to go through it with negative things holding us down enjoy your life the one you have right now not the one you hope to have sometime in the future not im going to enjoy myself when ill be glad when ill sure be glad when ill be glad when this is over ill be glad when this starts well what about being glad right now would anybody like to enjoy this day or do you want to just ruin this day thinking about how youre going to be happy when you know when your childs two enjoy the twoyearold dont sit around and wish they were three ill be ill be glad when the kids start to school ill be glad when schools out im tired of driving those kids to school every day ill be glad when these kids get through college im tired of paying those bills ill be glad when ill be glad ill be glad ill be glad well each one of those things that youre going to be glad about later is something that youre missing that trust me later when youre older youre going to think i wish i would have taken time to have enjoyed my family more i wish i would have taken time to enjoy my home more you have a choice each day you live regarding the attitude you choose the longer i live the more i realize the importance of choosing the right attitude in life it is more important than your past more important than your education or your financial situation its more important than your circumstances your successes or your failures more important than what other people think or say or do it is more important than your appearance your giftedness or your skills it will make or break a company it will make the difference between a happy home or a miserable home you cannot change the years that have passed you cannot change the daily tick of the clock you cannot change the decisions or reactions of other people im convinced that life is ten percent what happens to me and ninety percent how i respond to it the same is true for you your attitude is something that belongs to you and nobody i want you to get this nobody can make you have a bad one if you dont want to you have to make a decision set your mind that today im going to have a good attitude no matter what and you know i dont just tell you to do these things i do them i spend time each morning with the lord when i get up because i know if i dont i am not going to act good that day and to be honest most of us are like that we need just like you you need food to keep your body running right you need spiritual food which is the word of god and time with him to behave spiritually correctly i dont want to do anything that offends the holy spirit i want to love people like jesus told us to and i cant do it without a lot of help from god and so i pray every morning that god will help me that he will strengthen me i want to enjoy the day i want to appreciate the things that god has given me so i specifically set my mind today is the day the lord has made hes given me another day to live and i want to enjoy this day and have a good attitude help me treat people good that im with and make them feel good and just whatever comes to my mind so the main thing i want to get across is that you have to set your attitude and determine that youre going to have a good one in order for that to happen and your day today can be changed by you making a small adjustment your week can change by you making just a small adjustment and deciding just decide right now to think about everything you do have instead of what you dont have think about your blessings and nobody is without blessings there is nobody watching right now that doesnt have something to be thankful for yes we all have problems we all have challenges in life and maybe right now youre going through a very challenging time pray about those times do what you can do but focus on the things in your life that are good and find things to be thankful for and you can even be thankful for little things like clean running running water in your house a home to live in clothes to put on somebody to say good morning to just any anything that is a blessing the more you think about that the more its going to help and affect your attitude you know what its perfectly okay for you to be happy and enjoy your life while god deals with your problems you know i dont want anybody to think that you have to be miserable because you have a problem pray about the situation and then turn it over to god you know praying about things and then worrying doesnt really do any good we need to pray about them cast the care on god so one of the things that i say when i have a problem that helps me and i usually say it out loud and sometimes several times a day this is not going to last forever and i also like to say this is going to end well i dont know how its going to end but i know its going to end well listen whenever youre upset and youre having trouble dont let the trouble pull you away from god let it push you closer to god spend more time with him cry out to him seek his advice maybe youve had a lot of bad things happen to you in your life maybe you would be a person that says well im just not lucky well i dont think that when were dealing with god its good luck or bad luck its faith or no faith its trusting god its believing the promises in the word and ill tell you if you never give up on god he will never give up on you you may have some things that youre working through and it may be taking longer than you hoped it would but just dont give up,1.0
her message is perfect for this moment vp harris has flipped the election on its head,kim atkins stohr senior opinion writer and columnist for the boston globe claire mccaskill former senator from missouri and,move into the light and have the fight there is exactly where the fight needs to be waged and the polls already reflect what charlie is art ticlating let me show you what the new york times poll has today among likely voters and this is july nd through the th this is all post convention donald trump is at kamala harris is at its just an extraordinary move from june th to july nd where trump was at hes gone down a point after his convention and after the events of the weekend in pennsylvania and kamala harris is up ahead points of where president biden was talk about this reset which is palpable reportable and visible in the polls yeah those polls are reflecting a lot of things not only just the past of anxiety and angst that gripped democrats right after the debate but also in the time that the voters have had to get to know and focus on kamala harris they are realizing shes a candidate that really in so many ways her message is perfect for this moment democrats have been focused on reproductive rights since dobbs was overturned that has been probably the greatest issue driving the elections since that decision they also hear about climate they have somebody who put that in the center of her political message since the time she was a district attorney and then they have someone who cares very much about other rights of people we have a supreme court that not only attack reproductive right but is eyeing other rights for lgbtq folks and kamala harris was marrying people in california while barack obama was talking about civil unions she has a long track record on the very issues that are driving the electorate you have the enthusiasm which is important people will activate when they see enthusiasm around a candidate it really blunts this idea that some people are like oh america is not ready for a woman they are not ready for a black woman i think this is showing that america can be if you just have the enthusiasm and the support of that candidate behind them i think that can allow democrats to turn that important cornerfrom or even during from or even during the primary when i still heard a lot of democrats worrying that even though they liked kamala harris or elizabeth warren they are worried other people wouldnt vote for them if you support her and vote for her she will win isnt the answer to all those questions america isnt ready for a felon and an insurrectionist and a sexual abuser i feel like that question is gone in so many ways the question is erased by the regret and the remorse about the question is erased by the stellar conduct of this vice president as vice president as joe bidens partner on the campaign trail during those four weeks that were excruciating for everyone inside the pro democracy coalition but also by everyone that looks over at the other choice that party chose that party opted for a convicted felon that party opted for someone as recently as last year in a sworn deposition whose position is still when youre famous you can grab women between the legs because thats what famous have been doing for million years im not sure how he knows that who has also been charged with felonyies regarding the mishandling of secrets and the inciting of a deadly insurrection are we ready i dont know that question is posed to when the other choice is americas first convicted felon and adjudicated sexual abuser i think youre absolutely right i know there are a lot of folks who would say they vote for a rock over someone who as you just described donald trump but i think one thing thats driving the enthusiasm around kamala harris is the fact that she presents that contrast so clearly the contrast between the future and the past where we have been people are remembering some with ptsd the trump administration the bungling of the covid response and the economic problems and the hate and just the vengeance and just terrible feeling of that era they are seeing this hopefulness plus shes a prosecutor as you point out who better to prosecute the case against donald trump especially since he has been in many ways held to be above the law whether its from the inability of a supreme court to allow him to be prosecuted for crimes he consulted to the way that he has attacked people who has been holding him accountable thats one thing thats making america ready they have seen folks like fani willis like letitia james like alvin bragg actually have some accountability now you have another prosecutor who happens to be a woman of color those are the folks that have been getting this job done what better opoint for donald trump to face in november it is all future looking it is wrapped in this message about fighting for freedom but it isnt precious let me share this perfect troll of donald trumps appearance on fox and friends the harris campaign statement after watching fox news this morning we only have one question is donald trump okay he praised project hes flustered and lashing out when he isnt lying hes making threats hes praising deck taters because he wants to be one worried he made the wrong pick in jd vance old and weird this guy shouldnt ever be president again if anyone wants ab alternative kamala harris is offering one it is certainly firing on all those sillen engineers and offering this positive message the for the future making a very sharp contrast as kim said but not neglecting the ever important getting under the skin of ones opponent shes not afraid to do that kamala harris is confident enough to be loose by that i mean shell throw some punches shes not afraid to throw punches i watched her in hearings when she would she knew how to make a point and would not let the witness up until the point was made she did it very very effectively shes going to be able to do that with this guy and now he is the old guy who cant finish a sentence he cant escape that that is now sered into the hard drive of every swing voter in america so they are going to come after her but i got to tell you they have a couple problems one of the things is this extremism most swing voters dont like extremism they voted for both parties they are not consuming politics like we are they are not checking in constantly they get broad beams and this jd vance not years ago not when he was in college just in the last fews months as a united states senator he voted against protecting ivf he voted against protecting contraception birth control and maybe the most telling vote of all only senators voted with him he voted to allow law enforcement to get the medical records of women in america he thinks its okay for the police to get medical records that just is jaw dropping to most swing voters not acceptable in america hes against donald trump in the ways we have been talking about sibs he was selected he believes donald trumps is americas hitler thats a quote hes also expressed decades or years of disdain against donald trumps family he thinks women should stay in marriages if they are unhappy and violent the top of the ticket has a modern family the likes of which jd vance doesnt seem to approve of hes sort of a cultural scold on a ticket with donald trump he is a cultural scold but as you read about some of the votes that jd vance has taken the comments hes made it did cross my mind did donald trump vet this guy or were they just thinking hey i like the cut of his jibim going to go with him im going to go with him because clearly theres a real possibility he could be a liability here particularly when women hear what he is saying but can i talk about that poll for a moment showing this race being close just keep in mind the traditionally the week after a national the party convention the nominee has a significant bump maybe to points maybe that doesnt happen anymore but think again where donald trump was one week ago today before he accepted the good will that surrounded him after the assassination then the really unifying con convention and names the vice president he accepts the nomination ing normal politics he would be flying high this week the democrats would have their chance later but theres no bump whatsoever and then you also look at kamala harris this comes after three years where lets be honest most voters havent been pay inging attention to what shes doing they really dont know herand shes been underestimated in and shes been underestimated in the political world in the media even among fellow democrats one of the things that shaped this moment were a lot of democrats that we have to stick with biden because kamala would be too risk yp now shes come out in this very effective way so you set aside the poll today because i think things are so fluid but the

give it to god stop worrying amp trust god inspirational amp motivational video,when we give our burdens worries and cares to god it will bring us peace trust and believe that god is for you he loves you,lets start in matthew jesus is speaking said i tell you do not worry about your life what youll eat or drink or about your body what youll wear who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life and why do you worry about clothes oh you have little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own and then in philippians do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus jesus said very plainly very repetitively do not worry im of the opinion that if jesus says not to do something he has our best interests at heart hes not being meddlesome hes not trying to limit us hes concerned about our wellbeing and weve missed something something has eluded us we have tolerated something in our lives in our thoughts in our emotions weve tolerated something allowed it to flourish that in reality is destructive that jesus has said dont do that that we are so twisted and tied up and and melting down in our own worries and problems and we forget that we have a heavenly father right there saying do you want my help and we just got to say i want your help and trust that he can do what he needs to do let him do the work that needs to be done look if youre counting on yourself to solve all of your problems then of course youre worried and stressed out it doesnt matter how strong or wise or capable how charismatic you are it doesnt matter how much wealth or influence you have you are not designed to be able to take on everything and handle everything you will have more problems come at you than what you are capable of handling when you carry the responsibility of everything then you have to do everything you have to find the solutions you have to choose the right direction you have to power through problems you have to plan for the future make adjustments and you have to do all of it at the speed of life yeah youre stressed out youre worried of course but god does not want you to do it on your own he wants you to recognize that he is there to lead you to walk you through to guide you through every step of the way and heres the deal he doesnt want to just give you every resource that you need to get through your problems he wants to be what you need in every situation its amazing the problems that are solved the moment that you decide to trust god in everything because when you trust god you dont have to try to figure anything out anymore as you lean on him then you take the pressure off of yourself because you dont have to try to figure stuff out you dont have to try to change things that youve already tried a million times to change and the more you try to change the more frustrated it makes you because you can just finally say well god im trusting you with this and if you cant change it then i guess they dont need to be changed the only way you can learn to stop worrying and stop trying to figure things out stop being jealous of what other people have is i just honestly think that in addition to studying the word i think that we just have to try it our way long enough to finally just get worn out enough to just say okay god i surrender you know that beginning you know the end and everything in between you know every flaw that i have every fault that i have you know every weakness that i have as well as my strengths i surrender so many times i have just said god i dont know what to do god im overwhelmed or god im in over my head and you know ive said this many times god help please it doesnt have to be long it doesnt have to be eloquent i dont have to have the answers or the solutions i just need to go to the one who does have the answers have you ever been on an emotional roller coaster i mean youre just up youre down youre this way and you know what god says ill take care of that you ever go to bed thinking about it wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it in the morning you get up youre thinking about it man it has captured your thinking god says ill take your emotion and your thinking through christ jesus first peter says cast all your cares on him because he cares for you and what that means is that we take all of our problems and our worries and we choose to place it in gods hands and say i trust that you will handle the outcome are you confident that you can take your problems and your worries and place it in gods hands and that he can handle everything worry is the anticipation of the negative in fact theres a relationship between faith and worry its inverse faith diminishes as worry flourishes or as your faith flourishes your worry will diminish worry is the negative expression of what faith in god is one of them would be i dont want jesus to ever look at me and use my name and person of little faith in the same sentence do you i want to be a man of faith worry are you saying i dont think god can handle this so im gonna pick it up and im going to invest emotional energy and my thoughts and my anxiety im not gonna change the outcome a bit jesus said you cant add one hour to your life god can add years god has the best solution for all of our problems he sees and knows everything he sees the future he understands every angle of what is going on in your life right now he understands how people are viewing it and perceiving it he sees the best solution to your problems hes incredibly wise when i worry i am basically saying i am afraid that my life is not going to be that i would the way that i want it to but when i trust that god has the best solution i am saying god i believe that you have the best way for me even if its not the path that i chose or that i came up with and we can trust that if we follow god and if we trust him he will give us every resource that we need every step of the way and that at the end he can turn that into something wonderful and beautiful and let me tell you if you have someone who loves you enough and who is strong enough and who has the best solution what do you have to worry about see the reason that worry exists so often is because we just think its normal its not normal its common but its not normal it doesnt have to be in our life and its robbing us of god its robbing us of our family it distracts me from god in people it robs me of my joy and it exists because i allow it to exist listen to what im saying worry exists and anxiety exist because we allow it we are in complete control of our lives god would never command us to do something that we dont have the ability to do worry is a choice and trust is a choice you cant do both at the same time you have to choose to put your trust in god put the full weight of your problems and your life and your future into his hands and let him carry it worry and anxiety means the devil has implanted something in your life thats just sitting there intimidating you and because of that you cant focus on god in the people that you love and thats the greatest problem with worrying anxiety it robs you of your ability to worship to love the people that you love so its an enemy the root of all fear worry and anxiety is an orphan spirit because orphans are on their own and they have to take care of their own problems and the devil wants you to feel as though that youre on your own and you have to solve your own problems you have the best father in the universe stop grieving over the father you didnt have and start rejoicing that you have the best father in the universe and he loves helping you process anything in your life nothing is too small nothing is too large he just enjoys the ride he just enjoys the relationship and as were sitting here obsessing about something what it means is were wasting the relationship he does see your problems and he wants to help you gods love for you is so immense and that means that you can come to him with anything and everything we dont have to lead lives that are defined by worry and anxiety and fear doesnt mean those things wont come and they may even come with justification but jesus said we dont have to worry about that he is my provider he is my protector he is my promoter he is the person that i longed for in every relationship he is the place that i look to to find home he is my professor to reveal beautiful new things to me he is everything that i need and everything that i longed for when i go to him the key to peace is not being able to solve every problem the key to peace is resting in who god is when we give god control theres a beautiful promise that he will never leave or forsake you man we can walk in that path in that promise towards peace he doesnt want you to be overwhelmed with worry and problems he wants you to be overwhelmed with his love for you and you may be saying look you dont understand how many problems i have how many issues and how much ive gone through well you know what god says no matter what you have i want to take all of your problems all of your worries all of your failures all of your sin all of your brokenness give it to me because i can handle it and the truth is only i can handle it,1.0

a positive message from pope francis,bible prophecy marys rosary will crush the antichrist visit,welcome to revelation unraveledim your host william tapley also known as the third eagle of theapocalypse and the coprophet of the end times a couple of days ago my web manager complained she said your videos are getting toodepressing well i reminded her that the eagle in the apocalypse in revelation cries out woe woe woe but then i thought about it and when jesus prophesied he included thepositive as well as the negative so i asked her what would you suggest and she sent me this followingemail about the pope handing out rosaries at the vatican pope francis on sunday advised catholics to take a special dose of spiritual medicine offering some boxes of mercy containing rosary beads to pilgrims insaint peters square i now want to suggest a medicine what you ask the popeis now a pharmacist francis said shaking a box resembling a pack of tablets after reciting the traditional sundayangelus prayer from a window overlooking the square the instructions provided in several languages say can be used once a day but in case ofemergency can be taken as much as the soul needs the dose is the same for adults and children it adds the unusual medicine box was inspired byfollowers of polish nun mary faustina kowalskawho was made a saint in and is known as the apostle of divine mercy according to the italian news agencydont forget to take your medicine because it is good for the heart the soul the whole life the pope said so now i want to show you this photograph of the pope waving his box of medicine which is the rosary to thepilgrims gathered in saint peters square pope francis shows a rosary in a box design to resemble a packet of pillsduring his traditional sunday appearance from his studiooverlooking saint peters square at the vatican sunday november th joking that hes like a pharmacist pope francis is promoting prayer asmedicine for the heart appearing on sunday at his studio window francis held up a rosary in a boxdesigned to resemble a packet of pills francis down to earth way of speaking in a style ordinary people can readily understandapparently has helped draw huger than usual crowdsto saint peters square for the traditional weekly papalappearances about eighty thousand tourists andromans packed the square on a warm sunday day okay so now that is the positive side of this program but now i do have to add just a little bit of the woe woe woe the rosary is not justmedicine for your soul it is a weapon that we will use against the antichrist it is prefigured in the sword that judith cuts off holofernes head with it is prefigured in the cubit high scaffold that king ahasuerus hangs haman and his ten sons on haman andhis ten sons prefigure the antichrist and the ten kings of the antichrist the rosary is prefigured in the five smooth pebbles that david uses against goliath and remember that pebble embedded itself in goliaths forehead this is all prefigured back in genesis where the woman crushes the head of the serpent so i am not discounting pope francis because he is promoting the rosary which is wonderful it helps all of us individually especially in theseend times but it is also the weapon the weaponwhich jesus has chosen to defeat the antichrist but since this program was suggested bymy web manager i do want to close on a positive note she is doing awonderful job and i believe this weekend she will be posting the last chapter of danielchapter which again just like all of the other chapters that ive posted so far the vision chapters they also indicate that marysrosary that is will defeat number and that is mr antichrist,1.0
how to remove negative thoughts sadhguru jagadish vasudev answers,sadhguru looks at how the mind which should be the greatest boon is unfortunately being used by most people as a,sadhguru there are no subtractions and divisions in our mind there is only addition and multiplication i will just remove negative thoughts and i will have positive thoughts all the best its not going to work its just that you need to pay little attention as to how it functions you will see there is a distinction between what is you and what you have gathered well see the way the question is asked and also the way normally its addressed is people think there is something called as negative thought and positive thought they want to remove the negative thoughts and have only positive thoughts for such people i would ask them to just experiment for ten fifteen seconds let them forcefully remove one thought from their mind for example next ten seconds just dont think of a monkey try not to think of a monkey for next ten seconds you will see you will be full of monkeys so what i am saying is this is the nature of your mind because in this mind all the three pedals are throttle there is no brake there is no clutch whatever you touch it will only go faster in this kind of mind people have been taught from moral teachers and religious teachers do not think about bad things well since then its been a fulltime job so there is no way you can handle the mind like this this doesnt need any great enlightenment if you spend two minutes with your eyes closed you will realize you cannot do anything forcefully with this mind so i want to remove negative thoughts do not ever go in this direction because what you want to remove will become your quality always you will be on it so what should i do the thing is this without understanding the fundamental mechanism of this mind because our mind human mind is the most sophet sophisticated computer on the planet even all the supercomputers have come out of this when this is the case is it not important that we understand the mechanics of how it functions one simplistic aspect of how it functions is there are no subtractions and divisions in our mind there is only addition and multiplication if you try to do something with it it will say one more if you try hard it will multiply into many more in this mind you dont try to identify what is positive what is negative and try to remove it first of all one needs to understand this mind of yours this body of yours is supposed to serve you the life that you are is important body and mind are vehicles that must serve us if you sit in a vehicle it must go laughs where you want to go if it goes to its own destination what is the point of such a vehicle its just a nuisance right now most human beings are unfortunately experiencing this fantastic possibility of human mind as a nuisance as a troublesome thing well this is the most beautiful thing you have its just that you need to pay little attention as to how it functions one simple thing is this first and foremost process is thats why we put out this process called isha kriya this is to distance yourself from your physiological and psychological process there is something called as you which exists this is not a composite of all your thoughts and emotions and physiological processes beyond that there is you if you close your eyes even if you cannot see anything youre still there it is through the window of your eyes that you are looking out but if you close your eyes it doesnt mean that you dont exist you still exist so beyond your thought you still exist beyond your emotion you still exist so that you the life that you are this has to come into your experience why is it that youre not allowing that to come into your experience which is the most significant aspect of who you are who you are right now the most significant aspect is you and me are alive right now this is it what im thinking what youre thinking is not the important thing we are alive right now that is the important thing so it is important that you focus on this fundamental sense of aliveness within you and then you will see there is a natural distance between you and your thought process once there is a distance between your psychological process and your physiological process this is the end of suffering because there are only two kinds of suffering that human beings go through physical suffering and mental suffering once you create a little space between you and your mind between you and your body this is the end of suffering this is something every human being has to experience and know otherwise thinking i will just remove negative thoughts and i will have positive thoughts all the best its not going to work one hundred percent it s not going to work because nobody can remove it they can avoid it for some time so when negative thoughts come you say ram ram shiva shiva whatever you want but this is just avoiding its not gone the moment you stop that it will pop back with great force otherwise it will come back in your dreams so its very important first of all you need to understand your anger your resentment your fear your anxieties the negativity that you generate generally resentment anger it is always directed towards somebody but we need to understand this is poisons that we are drinking and expecting somebody else to die fortunately life doesnt work like that if i drink poison i die if i drink poison you dont die so we need to understand this when i say poison today you can have yourself chemically analyzed right now what is your blood work what it says five minutes of intense anger check your blood work and see there will be lots of negative elements in it literally youre poisoning yourself so do you want to poison yourself definitely not now the very question is coming from certain helplessness what shall i do dont do anything just sit back and just concern yourself with something which is the life process maybe your heartbeat maybe your breath maybe just the sensation of being alive depending upon how sensitive or how perceptive you are accordingly find something it could be a sensation in the body it could be breath it could be heartbeat it could be anything something which indicates life to you just pay attention to that for some time slowly you will see there is a distinction between what is you and what you have gathered which includes both your physiological and psychological possibility or mess whatever you ve made out of it,1.0

start your day with happiness every day decide to be happy morning inspiration to motivate you,every morning you have a decision to make to wake up happy or discouraged when we choose to live happy and have a positive,when we wake up in the morning we get to choose how were going to live that day we can choose to live in faith happy expecting favor or we can choose to live discouraged defeated focused on our problems happiness doesnt automatically happen its a choice we have to make you cant wait to see what kind of day its going to be you have to decide what kind of day is going to be first thing in the morning you need to make up your mind im going to live this day happy im going to see the good im going to be grateful im going to love my family im going to enjoy this day if you dont decide how youre going to live circumstances will decide for you youll see every problem how its not going to work out youll think i dont feel like going to work this traffics so bad i never get any good breaks when you dwell on those thoughts you may not realize it but youre choosing to live discouraged youre choosing to have a lousy day the scripture says joy comes in the morning every morning god sends you a fresh supply of joy you can dismiss it think thats not for me i have too much coming against me or you can receive it and say things may not be perfect in my life but i know gods on the throne hes ordering my steps his plans for me are for good so im going to enjoy this day decide to be happy thats number one everybody listening to this watching by tv make a decision today i am going to be happy and im not going to wait to have some great thing happening to me i am deciding that i am not going to waste one more day of my life being sad and sour psalm says let those who love your name be joyful in you and be in high spirits so were supposed to be in a really good mood like high spirits well i just dont feel very happy well your greatest privilege as a believer is you dont have to live by how you feel you can live by what you know in psalm this is the day which the lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it if youre going to be happy you have to be happy on purpose because there will be people betrayals delays all kinds of things that can cause you to live sour you have to put your foot down and say thats it im not letting other people steal my joy im not letting whats not working out cause me to be sour not letting this problem at work keep me from enjoying my life i will rejoice i will be glad i will live this day happy see your will is more powerful than how you feel dont wait to feel happy before you decide to be happy you have to decide first then the happiness will come i can be full of hope any day that i want to be full of hope and so can you i cant always make my circumstances line up with what i would like them to be but i can hope that good things are on their way i can hope which is believing that something good is going to happen every morning you need to say to yourself im happy im grateful im blessed you cant receive happiness if youre thinking sadness joy is coming every morning some people have been bypassing it year after year because of their thoughts you will live happier if youll start thinking happier its easy to get up and think yourself sad think yourself into selfpity why did i come down with this illness my friends are all married why am i still single these people at work are not treating me right this is not fair youre thinking yourself defeated you have to change what youre thinking yes i came down with this illness but father i want to thank you that youre restoring health back unto me that i will live and not die that my best days are still in front of me yes these people at work are not treating me right but im not a victim i know im a victor god youre my vindicator you said you would always cause me to triumph happy thoughts are god im grateful to be alive im excited about my future i believe youre taking me from glory to glory that i havent seen or imagined the great things you have in store when you think happy thoughts it not only lifts your spirit but that attitude of faith is what allows god to do amazing things youre as happy as you choose to be if youre unhappy you cant blame anybody for your unhappiness because happiness is a choice you dont go looking for happiness you create it it is the byproduct of right thinking and right acting happiness is not dependent on whats going on around you its dependent on whats going on in you what kind of thoughts are you thinking ill never get well ive had this too long youre thinking yourself discouraged i cant break this addiction its been in my family for years youre thinking yourself limited i cant be happy joel ive been through a lot of loss a lot of heartache thats not how your story ends heres a key you have to give yourself permission to be happy sometimes we bought into the lie that were not supposed to be happy weve been through too much weve made too many mistakes if were happy people may not understand can i tell you youre supposed to be happy god created you to enjoy your life to laugh to smile happiness starts on the inside give god something to work with when i stand here today and say the bible says that god has a good plan for your life something happens theres something about that word of god that touches something deep on the inside of you and theres just a little no matter how negative your life has been theres a little tiny spark of hope can that really be for me and when you begin to claim it as your own and you begin to think like this if anything good can happen to anybody it can happen to me sooner or later you got got to get tired of being on the outside looking in and decide its for me you and i are not here by accident god could have chosen anyone to be alive today there are billions of people that have lived and died but god handpicked you to be here at this time he woke you up this morning he gave you strength to get out of bed hes crowned you with favor he put seeds of greatness in you he calls you more than a conqueror the head and not the tail one way we honor god is by living happy he didnt create you to drag through the day overcome by problems discouraged by disappointments this day is a gift from god we should feel a responsibility to live it in faith happy joyful good nature once this day is over we can never get it back we dont have time to waste another minute being negative discouraged focused on what didnt work out complaining over who did us wrong get your joy back if we really understood how valuable each day is i think we would live it happier its easier to take it for granted just get up go through the motions deal with the challenges and the day is gone but if youll have a new perspective and start seeing every day as your best day then you wont let the little things upset you youll take time to enjoy the people gods given you to love when paul came to the end of his life he said i want to finish my course with joy were all going to go to be with the lord at some point i dont want to go discouraged feeling like a victim look what ive been through why did this happen lets go full of joy seeing each day as the best day getting up each morning and choosing to be happy when you go to work everyone may be complaining discouraged talking defeat dont fall into that trap stay full of joy keep a smile on your face keep thinking happy thoughts this world needs more happy people we need more joy in the world theres so much sadness gloom and despair if were not careful well let whats happening around us get in us thats why every morning you have to choose to be happy not i feel but i will rejoice i will enjoy this day i will be happy,1.0

a positive message for independent artists,i wanted to share my thoughts on the positive development of the independent workplace for creatives and artists,hi im daniel madisonthanks for bein here i do appreciate you spendin a little bit of time with me today ive been thinkin a lot about the future of playing cards and theplaying card industry the playing card communityand i wanted to share my thoughts with you and get your thoughts in return and see what you think to begin with i wanna givea little bit of an update on the madison trawlers playing cards these are the madison trawlers i released these quietly secretly on preorder on a presaleearlier this year and theyve almost sold out now ive been really quietabout these playing cards for a reason for a very specific reason that was driven by the production of the original madisonist playing cards so the trawlers are the followup deck to the madisonist playing cards and this deck the trawlers it will be the very last that yousee the madisonist symbol on a deck of playing cards im bringin it to an endwhen it comes to playing cards and using this symbol ibringin that to an end saying that there are a fewdesigns there are quite a few designs that i came up withand that i had help with with other designersthat i wanna show you so on my socials probablyon instagram soon ill be sharin some of the designs that never made it to print but theres a specific reason that i wanna put an end to the madisonistlogo on playing cards and its simply because ivemoved on from that stage in my life that i thoughtwas gonna be basically the end of my life withthis or a gravestone image things changed thisyear things picked up and i became a better personor at least im trying to be come a better personand charlie helped me dramatically with thatso thats why you see the new charlie madison logothats why i changed to this so its charlie forever for me but what happened with themadisonist playing cards in the production ofthose there were so many production delays and holdsup and things that went wrong and i was so excitedabout those playing cards being released that i didntshut the hell up about it i was talkin about themconstantly on youtube on instagram onlineconstantly promotin them because i was so excited about them and then when all the delays happened it feels longer it feelsso much longer between the announcement and therelease because of the delays same thing happened with the trawlers theres been a few holdupsthat couldnt be helped all on me but thats whyive kept them secret thats why ive not beentalkin and screamin and shoutin about those playing cards ive been sittin back waitin for them to be delivered to themadisonist warehouse so i just had an updatefrom the production of the trawlers andit is comin very soon im gonna spend a fewdays trying to figure out when the official release dates gonna be everybodys whos ordered them so far thanks thank you so much theres still a fewleft but in a weird way im hopin that they sell out before i even announce their release date so the few that are left youcan pick em up right now theres a link in this video description one of the things one of the reasons why that the madison trawlersare gonna be the last madisonist thing and thereason im movin on is because everything that i dowith playing cards has now changed in the past few weeksand the past month or so the way that i produce playing cards the way that i release playing cards and the future of playing cards for me is gonna be quite dramatically different and im not gonna talk about it just yet i will as soon as i canbut its really good news and its a really good thingand its an advancement i guess not just forme but for the design and the production and the art the artistry of playing cards so as soon as i can ill tellyou everything about that but what i wanted to talk about today got me thinkin a lot abouthow playing cards are made now and playing cards are producedand the drive behind them and the community that supports them and just the way thatthey go from conception to production to final sale the whole process haschanged dramatically when i first startedin the magic industry before i joined ellusionistmy firstever deck of playing cards the madison players which ive spoke abouton this channel before and i actually have some here in fact bret pendlebury bretpendlebury sent me these and these ones are frommy friend marty who once i finish this videoim gonna head over to electric picture house topick up some playing cards for the madison deck newsand im gonna go meet marty hes gettin a dope tattoo on his arm back then that was myfirst deck of playing cards and that was back i think it was like six or seven years ago back then and i dont wanna use the word fashion but designer playingcards like playing cards designed for an artist werent a thing like the only peopledoin was david blaine and dan and dave andellusionist had a few decks the tiger deck the viper deck so i kinda joined the industryat the beginning of that and i guess i was a bit ofa driving force behind the i guess i took the steeringwheel for ellusionist a little bit when wemoved up from the players to the rounders which idont have any rounders i have some pink roundersbut the first ever black rounders along withthe scarlet rounders it hadnt been seen before that too much the idea of a person an artist driving a deck of playing cardsand bein the force behind a deck of playing cards and im proud and happy to be have been there at the beginning of that now if you look at theindustry and community today it is dramatically different every mother swear word and his dog has a deck of playing cardsand every mother swear word and his dog can have adeck of playing cards because its so easy toachieve right now especially with companies likecartamundi cards of the world who are the guys behind my playing cards its really easy to doand its really easy to get a quality deck of playing cards even maybe one year agomaybe two years ago you could get a deckof playing cards online on mpc i think it was you could get one deck of cards printedbut the quality was terrible but now because ofcompanies like cartamundi anybody can have a deckof playing cards printed so this in the beginning i thought and i saw this and i thought of this just like a lot of people as problematic as not a good thingfor the magic industry not a good thing for theplaying card community certainly not a good thingfor the deceptive practises i guess and thatsinitial thought i think and i think it might havecome from a place of fear but also i think the industry itself and the playing cardcommunity and designers it balanced itself out its like an oscillation likei sit back and i just watch i dont ever try to fight for my cause i simply just stand formy own personal cause and it kind of happens around you if you fight youre creating a force that doesnt necessarily need to be there and what i mean by that iswhen it came to playing cards all the terrible playingcards that were released when all a sudden youcould make your own deck of playing cards theindustry became flooded became crowded withterrible playing cards and not even from terrible designers yes from terribledesigners yes from people who werent designersbut just wanted their own deck of playing cards butalso from the biggest companies and the biggest names wereproducing terrible playing cards and i think a lot of peopleand companies were trying to jump on that train thatwas movin so quickly playing cards sales wereshootin through the roofs and everybody jumped on board and there seemed to be a lot of people losin their sense oftaste and sense of style when it came to thedesign of playing cards so you saw a lot of terrible playing cards comin out simply because wecould release playing cards so all of the suddeneverybody rushes to it and everybody thinks letsput playing cards out and it was a strange thing to see but going back to what isaid its an oscillation like we did go through that patch when there were terrible playing cards but the community and the industry and the playing card worlditself balances itself out because with all theterrible playing cards that came around all of a sudden we had the good ones stood outbecause youve got a crowd of terrible decks and allof a sudden the good ones now they look goodagainst the terrible ones which is strange but now when you lookat the magic industry the playing card industry after that point when that movement has happened and i feel like its passingtheres less terrible decks and maybe its because people are learning or these designers are learning its definitely because designers are backing off a little bit but genuinely you do see alot of good playing cards like most of the playingcards that are comin out these days its hard to find a bad one and thats a really goodthing for the magic industry and the playing cards industry and i think a huge part of that which is why i wanted to make this video is because all of a suddenthe way that the creative not all of a sudden i guess this is how its worked all along but ithink the playing card industry and designers and artistshave finally caught up to this idea that we dontneed the middleman anymore like you you watching you as a creator you as an artist you whohas an idea in your head for a deck of playingcards you want a deck of playing cards made just make it make it put it out there the platforms are all there for you you dont need companies anymore and i think the transaction from supporter to artist is direct and ithink thats how it should be especially from theartists point of view but also from the supporter if youre pickin up somebodys project everybody who picks up oneof my decks of playing cards youre directly supportinme and its the same for every single artistand its now especially the same for people who arereleasing playing cards not companies but individuals people a good example i just did the deck review for chris seversonstechnique playing cards direct to the artist fromthe supporter to the artist and i think thats thefuture of playing cards because it allows the waythe platforms work now it allows the artist to not have to worry about funding and not haveto worry about the marketing because the marketings all there we all have youtubewe all have instagram we all have access to these things and when i say funded imean look at these websites kickstarter is the prime example some of the most amazing playing cards in the industry havecome from kickstarter and some of the future amazing some of the best playingcards to have ever been seen by the world that havent been created yet will happen on kickstarter so i guess the messagethat i wanted to put across in this if youre anartist if youre a designer youre a creator of playing cards dont wait for somebody tocome and give you a deal dont go to a company or dothat by all means do that but also understand studyand learn the industry and understand that youcan make playing cards you can make things happenwithout other people gettin involved and takin from it and when i say takin from it i dont mean financiallyi mean creatively a huge problem not a huge problem but a problem that i found from working for companies when it cameto playing card designs is so many different people were involved that the playing card design became theres not a deck of playing cards i didnt work on wherethe design was compromised by at least one personsomewhere along the line and thats fine if its a good team if its a creative team i mean the hellionsthe madison hellions so many different opinionscame in the way of that and manipulating the end product but that was for the betterthat was by far for the better it started off as somethingthat im glad it didnt become i know ive gone off on a tangent there but going back to theidea dont be put off on your ideas of releasing playing cards or wanting to get playing cards created or not just playing cards any creative any creations that you haveas an independent artist there is a way theresalways gonna be a way for you to get it out to the world there will be supportersbecause people are like oh those people are like me out there i know that there are somany people like me watchin and im connecting withthem day after day new people old people new friends through bein an independent artist and doing it on my own and my own buck dont be afraid of beinan independent artist and dont be afraid of the industries because i think whats happened now is as independent creatorsand independent artists were bigger than thecompanies now creatively and with the thingsthat were allowed to do and things that we have access to the independent artist is the future especially with playing cards from supporter direct toartist the best possible way that being said all of that being said

wake up and start your day with god listen to this every day morning inspiration,wake up and start your day off right with god get up every morning stronger than yesterday morning motivation to begin your day,the scripture says in chapter one of mark verse in the early morning while it was still dark jesus got up left the house and went away to a secluded place and was praying there you think about when you get up in the morning how much of the world crowds itself into your thinking you have to get dressed of course eat breakfast and you got to get in your car and drive down the expressway or somewhere and finally get to work in as soon as you do its chatta chatta chatta chatta chatta all the day or the keyboards flying all the day and your mind is full then youve got to get back in your car get back on the highway and and dodge the traffic again all the way home and when you get there you undress try to relax and then theres dinner i can fill up your day and not even know you and so where is god wheres gods private time with you so where do we begin with our priorities first and foremost we must make certain that our top priority is god almighty jesus christ said it this way seek first the kingdom and all of these things shall be added unto you so many times we have it backwards we are pursuing all of these things and we forsake in the king in his kingdom so many times we want the things that god promises without doing what god requires in order for the promise to become ours god told the children of israel if you obey my voice if you heed my commandments ill make you the head and not the tail he said make me your priority be as consistent as you can give it everything youve got every time you get up to go because you have no idea when youre not going to get the chance again its the supernatural law of breakthrough its when you do the same thing over and over and over and over and over again that you begin to see the mountain of impossibility begin to move prayer and perseverance go together if youre gonna become a person of prayer you will be a person of perseverance jesus said give us this day our daily bread god has said he will give you everything you need for life and godliness he said you dont have to worry about what youll eat or what youll wear where you live that god knows you need those things that if youll seek first his kingdom hell give you all of those things we flip it around and say god ill seek your kingdom first when i get all of those things accumulated trust god on a daily basis to say lord you made every need i have today and i believe youll meet my needs tomorrow so im gonna leave that with you now while i lay down to rest tonight in the bible the the day begins with sundown and we go to sleep while god begins the day and the sun rises and you awake to join god in the day that hes already been diligently working at for several hours when you lay your head down tonight lord i trust you for all the provisions ill need tomorrow the time ill need the wisdom i need the resources ill need when we talk about a life of prayer were not talking about once in a while were talking about that everyday you sense the need the desire and the joy and the awesome power that comes through praying talking to the father that is it ought to be a habit something that is recurring in your life not just when you get in trouble when you get in need but because you love god because youre grateful for who he is and what hes doing in your life pray about everything everything that comes up just pray come on pray pray pray pray pray about everything you dont have to be on your face or on your knees or in a closet or in the dark or with your eyes shut its good to have those set apart times with god i have that every morning but pray your way through the day and dont let the devil lie to you and tell you that god doesnt hear your prayers you say yeah but the things that ive done wrong why is god gonna listen to me because you dont go in your name you go in the name of jesus in the morning when you to get up amidst your prayer before you when youre meditating before you even get out of the bed you should say lord i just want you to fill me with your spirit today you cant live a godly life unless you have a good prayer life because the prayer life keeps you connected to almighty god sensitive to his will and his purpose and his plan for your life you dont pray you wont live a godly life how are we building our life i spent so many years going to bed at night regretting what i spent my day doing and i dont want to do that anymore and i dont want you to do it i want to go to bed at night and be proud of what i got done that day you know waste of any kind is sad and certainly the waste of an entire life is the saddest of all how many of you know somebody that is just wasted their whole life i will not live like that i am not gonna get to the end of my life and have nothing left but regrets and the only way that you can not have regret tomorrow is to do whats right today today we need to start making right choices if god is dealing with you about anything in your life and you know that you need to be obedient him and youre putting it off for another day i think tomorrows may be the most dangerous word that we have in our english language ill do that tomorrow ill do that tomorrow what what if jesus comes today im yelling to somebody get up its time to get up and start doing something with what god has given you every day that you spend feeling sorry for yourself its a totally wasted day its completely unproductive it does not help your future in any way shape or form it just keeps you stuck in the same spot we have to get over thinking that everything should be easy for us ill tell you a phrase i would like to see you get out of your collection of phrases that you use lets get rid of this statement its just too hard but but its just too hard you know what nothing that god leads us to do is too hard see its foolish to think that we cannot do what god tells us to do and still have things work out right how many things do you believe that god has put on your heart that you should do or not do but you still have not obeyed him are you living your life on purpose each day working toward the purpose you feel that god has for your life and your purpose can change at different seasons in your life give yourself to what youre supposed to do in this season of your life bloom where youre planted and dont get so addicted to your plan that when god wants to change it you wont let go of it and go do something else and dont minimize whatever it is that god wants you to do right now dont minimize that knowing that hes in charge it doesnt make a difference what happens how it happens through whom it happens for whatever reason i know that god is in control and i can trust him but whatever he allows in life trust in the lord with all your heart lead not to your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and hell direct your path he listens to you you listen to him you obey him he guides you thats an awesome sense of intimacy in a life that trusts god and if you want to know whether youre a trusting person or not ask yourself this question what am i worried about whatever youre worried about is gods long awesome finger saying youre not trusting me at this area of your life a godly life is a life of trust and when you begin to focus on god heres what happens worries drift away concerns drift away your mind is no longer contaminated with all kinds of things that do not do you any good at all the wise way to live is to obey god and leave all the consequences and circumstances to god you see you have to you have to choose you have to choose some things you have to choose to go with them or with god have this or have god walk this way or have gods way the reason we dont do things that are absolutely sacred godly awesome lifechanging lifting habits its because weve decided to choose the worlds way youll never understand or be able to enjoy a life at its best until you surrender your life to christ you may be walking through a difficult season and there may be some very uncomfortable places in your life but i suspect theres something you can be thankful for we want to learn to give thanks to the lord it is a protection over your heart and your mind become good and being grateful be grateful for the people in your home be grateful for the people that live around you be grateful for the place where you can work the people that you work with i dont want you to spend this whole year talking about if i want you to start this year and end this year saying thank you god thank you god that you heard me thank you god that you have enough for me thank you god that youre making a way,1.0

for,so i know everybody loves downloads and channeling and so im going to play with you and you know share with you that yes uh i got inspired by this book just sometimes in the middle of the night i go and just type nobody no thing took over me but if you want to call it downloads i call them downloads because we are all connected to the ultimate information of the universes and beyond which means that everyone has access to the exact same information because we are actually one mind so im going to share with you a few things in here the most important things that i got downloaded with that you can start using right now if you dont believe these things in here thats okay eventually youll figure it out oops im the most powerful thing walking around as is everything else are you ready to take control of that im going to talk about the ask whats the ask it is given what is it lets go welcome to landria onkka on youtube here to help you break through those fears and live an amazing life you know people say i dont like these doomsday you know end of days videos which they dont watch and find out that im telling you in all of those videos no matter what that title says it doesnt exist if we dont want it to i talked about the doomsday clock what is it an artist created it her husband was part of the manhattan project he was one of the scientists so i think she was probably concerned and she wanted to warn people she created that it was an artist thing all right and then the scientists created this wow this is sort of like cool maybe we can adjust the clock back and forth thats all it is i am telling you that everything is malleable changeable all of of it all of it so whats a download whats a channel its you accessing information everythings an illusion if it has a name or a label its an illusion its a creation thats just something that we experience and explore thats it no one thing can be this person or that person or that angel or that it its impossible because were everything but it will appear as that to play out certain illusions i want to talk to a certain age ill go go for it man you can its its true and just like im talking to landrea or barbara or steve or what thats true too in the illusion theyre all illusions yeah its actually pretty cool so first of all i hope youll subscribe and support my channel which will never ever tell you that you cant change absolutely everything and that we can live a new earth thats just a fact and im sorry if you dont believe that then you can go on conspiracy theory channels and thats okay i dont know it doesnt feel good does it what your feelings are your feelings project and actually create so its really important for us to stay in that high frequency and im going to talk to you about breakthrough fear if you dont have the book then youre going to love this and if you have the book youre going to love it too because you know that i go into detail on all of this im going to give you the actual before we even start the chapter the downloads that i got that ultimately say everything and then i go into the details this weird these were downloads that i got ill admit it all right but landria the persona didnt disappear during that everything is one thing happening boom end of chapter i dont have to say anything else everything is one thing happening oops that mean wait everythings one thing that means that you and i are one thing that yeah time does not exist so its an illusion too so is this whole earth earthlan experience thats an illusion its a real creation but its not what we ultimately are its us playing this creation out so time exists here on planet earth because there has to be a cause and effect if we didnt have time here our our linear time we would not know the consequences of our actions right wed be all over the place at one time which is what happens when were not in our bodies however here if i do this i have to know that eventually its going to cause this oops it might cause this or this or this further down but theres always a cause and effect so time allows us lessons so i cant get away with anything theres a cause and effect thats going to show up in the linear timeline uh illusion on planet earth as part of the game everything seen and unseen is intelligent everything that rock is intelligent doesnt have a brain or think like we do its just intelligence everything seen and unseen this space is all intelligence it doesnt have to be a thing or a brain in fact this is powerful much more powerful than we are in our current form because theres no density involved once you go outside your bodies all right everything seen and unseen is intelligent energy one field ever expanding creating evolving transforming exploring all that is possible which is is unlimited you ready for that lets do that again everything seen and unseen is intelligent energy one field ever expanding creating evolving transforming exploring all that is possible which is unlimited that means even darkness is one the one good or bad how can it be separate if one is the one created everything then it must be exploring darkness too its not good nor bad its just exploring it knowing it doesnt feel good but this everything is one thing with no boundaries from infinite nothingness to all knowing it is both consciousness and unconsciousness its unconsciousness too it is light and darkness and everything in between it is pure it and illusion posing as the opposite of that of which it is pretty cool huh you the human are an expression of the one energy everything is by choice because everything and nothing is directed by the creator which is all things by choice we forgot this and chose ignorance we forgot this purposely we didnt just oops i forgot it it was like no were choosing to forget it and choosing ignorance thats what humans are we chosen consciousness you are the everything that is intelligence exploring separatism you are everything that is intelligence exploring separatism and individualism ignorance and redemption you are the power that creates and the created you are that which you believe is the other you are that which you believe is the other thats pretty cool isnt it everything that exists in every dimension and every time is one now so when you go outside your bodies you can actually be everything everywhere at all you have this what i call the knowing is that you are now the the one mind that knows everything that is has been ever will be every probability all timelines all everything all illusions and beyond human minds cant comprehend that time as we know it does not exist it is an illusion that allows us to experience a past with choices that result in present results and present choices that result in future results cause and effect is how we know and gauge our spiritual evolution we are creators of our own illusions thats just page one thats just page one im going to do im going do a twopart series here if you take in just that word first page that first download page that i got you could change your life because then you realize youre in charge of everything youre in charge of every thought every reality every choice ignorance you can change all of it because guess what youre not ignorant anymore youre not unconscious anymore youre youre aware you still might have limitations you still might say this is how things are and theyre wrong and separatism youre still in the illus illusion of that and when you go past the illusion of separatism you tap into that space that downloaded that information not because its talking to you separately because you are it you are the other that you believe is something separate you are that which you look at because you feel that you are an individual body and you think of yourself as that and thats just one part of it and if this body can dissolve an end right pure to end then you cant be this body or this person because energy cannot be created nor destroyed so that means youre eternal which means what yeah you are that which animates this and beyond its pretty cool cool isnt it were going to explore this further so

trust that god is in control hour powerful christian motivation inspirational amp motivational,keep trusting god he is always in control even when your circumstances may seem out of control so when you are feeling,when you look for the word first in the bible you find this teaching you go first to god with your problems we dont take our problems first to the bar we dont numb our fears with narcotics we dont deny the existence of our struggles no we take our problems first to christ he said seek first the kingdom and his righteousness and look all these things will be given to you as well would you like some advice to take into this year that will save you from a month of heartaches go first to god with your problems the moment a problem surfaces is the moment you take that problem to god dont take it out on your friends dont take it out on your family dont try to solve it yourself you take that problem first to god seek first the kingdom and see if all these things arent given to you as well take it to him first you see when gods people put god first blessings begin to flow i want to challenge you to let this be the year you put god first keep first things first he promises and then everything else will fall into place actively seek gods direction in other words gods strategies are better than ours the prophet isaiah said his ways are higher than my ways his thoughts are higher than my thoughts gods strategies are always better so ive got to seek him ive got to ask him for direction and how do i do that i do that through prayer why because we dont want our plans to prevail we want gods plans to prevail we want gods wisdom in our life thats why we seek him thats why i get up in the morning and pray and talk to god what i need gods direction i cant live life on my own impulses my own strategies my own gut instinct no i need the spirit of god giving me wisdom and thats something that can only come to pass through prayer but heres what ive noticed many of us in the body of christ churches and christians we go to god with an already made up mind like we know what were going to do and then were just asking god to bless it but gods saying i wasnt in it to begin with and youre asking me to bless something that i didnt ordain in your life i didnt want you to make that choice you made that choice and i believe god wants to help you no matter what the situation is but gods not here just to give to you he wants to guide you not just give you things he wants to guide you in psalm it says i will guide you along the best pathway for your life how many of you are thankful that god has a best pathway for your life but we have to seek his direction well josh i dont know i dont know how this all gonna work out why dont you just read proverbs chapter three verse five and six it says trust god from the bottom of your heart and dont try to figure out everything on your own listen for gods voice in everything you do and everywhere you go hes the one who will keep you on track god will keep you on track dont plan first and then when youre out in the middle of doing what you want to do pray for god to make it work now first we pray about everything acknowledging god in all of our ways and he will direct our path but there are times in our lives where our actions arent necessarily in obedience to what gods told us to do why because we want to do something else or what gods asking us to do doesnt feel good or what gods asking us to do doesnt align with our plans our actions are inconsistent with what we say that we believe so what do we have to do we got to get the right habits habits are powerful they create our future the habits that we live with and our actions that we do every day create the future that were going to experience today i would dare say that many of us are sitting in the middle of a life that weve created by our own habits by our own actions and when were experiencing difficulty in life and when were tired of it its then we got to say you know what i cant keep doing this thing anymore its bringing pain into my life and its not working out so what habits does god want to help you drop this year what habits does he want to help to establish on the inside of you you see for some of you i believe that god wants to help you establish a habit of prayer a habit of prayer in your life where you start seeking god in the morning in a fresh way you start knowing gods will for your life some of you he just wants you to be faithful to come to his house more make church a priority in your life and i know the kids sports are important i know that things come up and im not saying that all that stuff is bad but if you dont make parents if you dont make church a priority in your kids life dont to be surprised that when they move out of the house its not a priority to them it takes faithful consistency in our actions to get breakthrough i believe breakthrough people do consistently what other people just do occasionally most christians i know who grow cold in their faith or who who grow unproductive or unfruitful or unhappy in their lives do not do so out of a moment of rebellion but do so as a result of minute by minute or day by day just drifting off course the book of hebrews the writer of the book of hebrews says we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard lest we drift away from it let the discipline of the first fruits recalibrate you every day every week so you can stay focused and you can stay on target now one of the saddest scriptures in the bible is jeremiah says my people have forgotten me days without number but i love the net translation of jeremiah does a young woman forget to put on her jewels have you ever forgot your cell phone and went back home to get it says will a bride forget to put on her wedding dress but my people have forgotten me for more days than can even be counted well go back home if we forget our cell phone but has anybody here ever forgotten to pray and thought oh im going back home to pray before i start this day im suggesting that you no longer try to work god into your schedule but you work your schedule around god he would like to guide you and lead you through life and literally let me say it again be involved in everything you do in every decision you make god wants to be part of it be patient be patient and wait dont give up dont give in james one says consider it a sheer gift when tests and challenges come at you from all sides you know that under pressure your faith life is forced out into the open and it shows its true colors in other words you really in it or not it says dont try to get out of anything prematurely let it do it its work so you become mature and well developed not deficient in any way one translation says that youll not lack anything if i dont give up on god then i know on the other side of my faithful obedience and patience then im going to be im going to be stronger than ive ever been im going to be more mature than ive ever been my marriage is going to be better than its ever been im going to not be lacking anything that i need in my life if i dont throw in the towel and give up when times get hard im going to trust god and gods going to bring a breakthrough you know how youre going to get through the attack youre facing friends you know how youre going to get through the trials and the tribulation that you feel like youre facing today youre only going to be able to get through it with gods help many years ago god finally got this through to me and he simply said this you cannot do this and by this he meant life ministry whatever your this is were talking about youre this rather youre this is raising four kids whether youre this as being a single parent you cannot do this unless you put god first in your life that means i cant do without him how do you keep going when times are tough its because you believe that your breakthroughs right around the corner my breakthrough is on the way i may not have it yet but im closer today than i was yesterday quit tying gods hands and take the limits off of him your situation is not too big for god what youre dealing with its not like god havent seen it before hes done it before he can do it again theres no sickness that god having healed theres not a soul that he cant deliver theres not a marriage he cant put back together but you got to trust him and take the limits off of him limits are something that bound or restrain or confine something or someone who cannot do something or have reached their limits but i want to tell you that there is no limit in god hes able to do whatever you need him to do he knows that whatever your problem is he knows the solution to your problem the bible says ephesians and now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh in us you know there is no limit in god hes able to do whatever we need him to do and know this theres nothing too hard for god but when you take the limit off of god you will see miracles take place if you trust him take the limits off of him expect the great awesome things will happen in your life god dont give you what you want he gives you what you believe see the howto is none of your business you keep getting in the way of the blessing cause you all up in the howto part of it show me the scripture where he tells you to figure out how to do anything he dont ask you to how to nothing you just need the word you need to know what its saying applied to you you know why because its a promise of his he never lied he always come through psalm verse he says yes they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel they limited the holy one of israel now how is it possible that we can limit god isnt god limitless isnt god bigger than than we ever could think or imagine doesnt he want to do exceeding abundantly above all above and beyond all that we can ask or think anybody got an answer to that absolutely hes bigger than all that but yet they limited him but we do put limits on god sometimes in our mind we have a version of what god is capable of we have a version of what god is like we have a version of what jesus is like we got to get rid of a small god we gotta let go of a small jesus we gotta stop worshiping a small savior he is the conquering king he is the king of kings and the lord of lords he is bigger than you ever imagined he is greater than you ever imagined god is able to do so many things but we limit him we limit him because of what we hear other people say we limit him because of a human natural experience we limit the holy one of israel god is unlimited amen in matthew chapter jesus came into the house the blind man came to him and jesus said to them do you believe that im able to do this do you believe that im able to do this do you believe no i didnt say do you believe you can see but do you believe jesus said do you believe that i am able to do this our faith is not in our faith our faith is in him it is not your faith it is who you have your faith in a lot of times people are limiting their own lives in what they say about themselves being down on yourself feeling like youre not good enough like youre less than and this voice can come to us in a lot of different ways the world is going to tell you what you cant do satan is going to tell you what you cant do you dont also need to be in agreement with those voices instead you need to agree with what god says about you if god approves you then approve yourself if god chose you then choose yourself if god believes in you then you should believe in yourself we got to learn to stop the negative voices and start to recognize im still a work in progress so often we look at the mess and we dont look at the progress david had a different kind of voice he said this in psalms chapter and verse because of god i can run through a troop because of my helper the lord i can leap over a wall you see because of god i can do you see that we need to take on that same uh that same kind of phrasing in our life that same kind of belief system because of god i can not i cant ill never be enough im not smart enough i got rejected i had a bad start pastor no david didnt do that david said because of god i can you know people are going to say stuff about you to try and limit you but dont limit yourself youve got enough against you for you to be against yourself if god is for you then why would you want to be against yourself take off the limits of what other people try and put on you they said you cant do it but that doesnt mean that you cant do it they didnt create you see god will take the unique things about you and use them to promote you and elevate sometimes the same thing you dont like about yourself is the same thing god wants to use to show you greatness and promotion whats our job to stop being mad about ourselves and putting ourselves down stop being so hard on ourselves quit telling yourself all the reasons you cant accomplish your dreams what you dont have what you didnt get its not going to happen just by your ability your talent your connections its going to happen by the spirit of the living god hes breathing on your life right now his favor is surrounding you in a greater way there are breakthroughs already enroute healing promotions contracts the right people theyre already headed your way now dont talk yourself out of it receive the blessing now take the limits off of god and take the limits off of yourself most people have kind of a fatalistic theology that things just happen and its fatalistic and it theres nothing you can do about it and that is absolutely untrue god has a perfect plan for every persons life in here and god has good thoughts for you his plans for your life are awesome he never made a piece of junk he never made a dud he never made an average person every one of us have something special that god wants to accomplish but most people are ignorant of this and they have bought into the lie of this world that theres nothing special about them every one of you are special every one of you are unique every one of you can do something that nobody else can do god has a purpose for your life and most people are limiting what god can do because they just arent challenging themselves god made you for something great god has taken ordinary people what the world calls ordinary people and time after time after time after time after time has just transformed their life and then use them to touch other people and change things but when you put god first i guarantee you he will transform your life while i wait god works this is not a a nice little christian sentiment to get you through a hard season this is anchored in the unchanging word of god he promises us if you wait on me ill work for you if you wait on me if youre patient if you have expectation if you dont give up if you dont cash out if you just keep following me i promise you you may not see what im doing you may even be tempted to think im not doing anything at all but all the while im orchestrating things for my glory and for your good god works while we wait even when i dont see it and even when i dont feel it youre working so grab hold of that and cling to that truth it doesnt mean your circumstances change in a minute it doesnt mean youre going to wake up tomorrow to uh to a bed full of roses it just means that while you wait heaven works gods always working no matter what the crossroads youre at in life when you are forced to face the trials and tribulations of life when you are at the point not knowing what to do or where to turn you can trust in god every one of us go through valley experiences every one of us are faced with these valleys these are part of the experience of life but every time we go through these valleys we need to know that hes there god may not he may not do what you think he may do the total opposite of what you think but hes still going to do something so many times we think god what have you done why have you left me out no man apathys not in that brothers vocabulary and he aint never late he made time he is time he has infinite wisdom he has all the information that could ever be known hes the alpha the scripture says in the omega so he stands at the end and makes decisions about now where we stand in the now and go with all the information we have we dont know why god youre not doing this and gods going oh thats because you dont have all the information yet theres a lot of things you dont understand yet and im navigating all those pieces to make sure what we do isnt fast but is right and is good and is noble lamentations says this the lord is good to those who wait for him to the person who seeks after him you have to know today that we are serving a god who is other than us its not a better version of you bigger version of you cleaner version of you his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts is what isaiah says so when you cant hear his voice speaking trust that his hands are working trust gods timing while you wait trust gods timing while you wait theres a reason for your delay see theres a reason for every season that we go through and if well not get bitter and upset well start to trust god in the middle of the season see i like a and i like z im not a big fan of l m n o p im not a big fan of the middle i like the beginning and the end but god says if youll trust me from l to m to n to o to p ill take you to z and youll be grateful because what im doing in you is more important than where youre going to what im going to do in you is more important than what ill do through you ive got to do something in you at g h i j k before you get to z you think youre ready for the blessing but im still preparing you im still working and its a process trust gods timing hes got a plan for you hes got a plan for your life in the season that youre in no matter how big your problems are if if you can spend time in the presence of god and you know that hes walking with you it overrides everything else thats going on in your life because you just know that hes going to take care of it some way somehow you just make sure that you stay in faith that you keep believing and let me work as long as youre believing god is working and ill tell you what we need to be saying more of and ive ive ive been doing this for a good number of years and its really really helpful when im waiting on something and then i start to think about how long its been and you know my mind starts to go negative i say out loud god is working god is working and it helps me because he is you know when you get a breakthrough god didnt start just working on that a second before you got it gods working in your life right now hes heard your prayers hes working in your situation but especially when youve prayed prayers for other people you have no control over how long it takes them to listen to god you work hard and youve believed god and youve been waiting what seems like forever for that kid to change or for your finances to change or for you to change or whatever but im here to tell you ive been there done that still go through it in different seasons at different times and i am telling you by the word of god and from my my experience and the experience of many others that god is faithful and i dont know how long you will have to wait but i do know that god will come through and i do know that you can enjoy your wait if you will just improve your attitude how we wait is possibly more important than what were waiting for if were going to spend all this time waiting why not wait with the right attitude why not live our best days even while were waiting for the destination you dont have to wait till you get to the destination to live out your best days you can start living out your best days even while youre waiting thats what god wants for us and i feel like god has this this thought with us he says listen theres a right way to wait and theres a wrong way to wait some people wait with impatience they wait with anger frustration twiddling their thumbs when are you going to be ready when are we going to get there are we there yet uh some people wait with anger why why have i not reached to where i want to be why have we not sold the house yet why why havent we moved into a house and sometimes we can get tired while were waiting on the next season of life and hope begins to wane in the waiting doesnt it because you begin to think okay well maybe tomorrows going to be the day well after so many maybe tomorrow is going to be the day the enemy begins to have a playground with your mind and go no yesterday wasnt the day and tomorrows not going to be the day im waiting here we as a people dont like to wait so at the end of the day what do you do when you feel like his voice is silent we trust that his hands are active his ability to work does not hinge on my perception of him working he is god almighty and paints on a bigger canvas than i can imagine this is who he is hes never missed a call hes never done something he wished he could take back hes never been so busy figuring out something that he missed you over here while you were doing your thing never one time has god failed and today wont be the day he starts and you wont be the person that he starts with this is the hope but remember what is hope its a positive expectation that something good is going to happen to me to have hope and expectancy is the hebrew translation for the word wait so hes not saying just wait like you know maybe this is going to happen or id kind of like throw you know throw a coin in a wishing well i hope this i wish this would happen no he says wait with an expectant heart that gods going to bring this to pass wait with great expectations and this is what isaiah says he says if youll wait upon the lord and youll wait the right way he will renew your strength you will mount up with wings like eagles you will run and not be weary you will walk and not faint thats gods promise to us that if we wait the right way were not going to get burned out were not going to get exhausted were not going to get impatient and settle for something less than what god has promised us to wait on were going to be able to hold steady in the middle of our waiting and not fall off not quit church not quit believing in god not give up on the promises sometimes when were waiting for a promise its easy to get exhausted while were waiting its easy to get impatient to feel burned out to just say you know what whatever im not going to church im not going to believe it im going to stop reading my bible when the promise comes to pass then ill believe that gods for me weve got to learn how to wait with expectancy that even while were waiting for the promise to come to pass gods with me hes for me hes working behind scenes it will happen god im believing that my best days are not behind me lord im believing the promise will come to pass whats in front of me is going to be greater than whats behind me lord what youre doing in me is greater than what is happening to me lord im standing on your promises i will not quit i will not give up im expecting a harvest in jesus name gods saying its time for you to wait with great expectations this season is important dont get bitter while youre waiting for the promises of god to come to pass while youre waiting for that family member to get back to church while youre waiting for that that loved one to give his life back to jesus while youre waiting for a house to sell while youre waiting to to to do that next season direction from god whatever youre waiting on god says wait with great expectations put your hope in the lord james chapter verse says that were called to wait like a farmer waits for the harvest a farmer is confident hes not stressed out hes not worried i dont know if the harvest is going to come no he knows harvest is on the way ive done my work ive planted ive done all the watering its just a matter of time before the harvest gets here see were called to wait with that kind of confidence god the promise is coming to pass what ive been praying for lord ive been sowing the seeds lord im expecting the harvest is on the way let me ask you a question when are you going to start thanking god for the miracle in your life you know that thing youve always wanted to happen that prayer youve always been praying that dream youve always had when are you going to start thanking god for you say well after it happens when you thank god after something happens thats called gratitude when you thank god for something before it happens thats called faith the highest form of faith is thanking god in advance before you get the answer but while you make the request what do you do while youre waiting you thank god say god you know that request i made the other day i thank you that the answer is already on its way its not here yet but i thank you that the answer is already on its way and you just keep thanking and thanking that is the highest form of faith you dont keep saying please give it please give it please give it please give it please give it you say god heres what i need now thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank that is faith thanking god in advance say thank you in advance for whats already yours its how i live my life thats why i why i am one of the reasons why i am today say thank you in advance for what is already yours true desire in the heart for anything good is gods proof to you sent beforehand to indicate that its yours already ill say it again true desire in the heart that itch that you have whatever it is you want to do that desire that itch thats gods proof to you sent beforehand already to indicate that its yours jesus said this in mark chapter anytime you ask for anything in prayer believe that you have received it and you will receive it now i really want you to get this notice the change in tense here believe that you have received it thats past tense and you will receive it thats future tense you say wait a minute ive got to believe ive got it in order to get it yep thats called faith i believe that ive got it already in order to get it youre saying you mean i got to believe a thing is so even though it isnt so so that it will become so yes thats called faith we all have dreams and goals that gods placed in our heart things were believing for situations were praying to turn around these promises start off like seeds they dont come to pass overnight theres always a period of waiting involved and from the time we pray till the time we see it come to fulfillment thats called the trial of our faith this is when many people get discouraged and give up they start believing the negative thoughts its never going to happen its taken too long now that seed is lying dormant its still alive it still has potential but you have to do your part and start watering the seed the way you water it is by thanking god in advance you cant wait till you receive the promise you have to thank god that the answer is on the way maybe youre struggling in your health the medical report doesnt look good dont talk about how you feel say father thank you that im healthy thank you that im strong thank you with long life youre satisfying me thats not just being positive thats watering the seed in your finances maybe youre struggling business is slow all through the day father thank you that whatever i touch prospers and succeeds thank you that im coming out of debt thank you that your favor surrounds me like a shield when you thank god in advance for the answer it not only waters the seed but that strengthens your own faith so often we think ill give god praise after the problem turns around ill thank god after business picks up after i see the solution now if you dont learn this principle to thank god in advance you wont have the strength you need to wait for the promise what keeps us strong is getting up in the morning saying father thank you that my dreams are coming to pass thank you that this problems turning around thank you that youre bigger than this obstacle giving thanks to god removes the anxiety you can be anxious and worried about anything you start thanking him praising him focusing on him and it is amazing how the anxiety disappears next thing you know you think well what am i worried about ive got holy almighty sovereign god on my side taking care of me why am i down in the dumps listen living in the dumps isnt gods plan and he can get you out real fast you start thanking him and praising him the devil runs and god gets you out youre rejoicing and praising the lord before you know it because anxiety and fretting over things is not the will of god were thanking god before the battle were thanking god in advance thats verbalized faith thank you god youre taking care of my bankruptcy thank you god youre taking care of my pain thank you god youre taking care of this conflict thank you god and im thanking god in advance once you pray and ask god to bring the promise to pass you ask god to heal you you ask him to restore a relationship from then on you dont need to ask god one more time he heard you the very first time now every time you think about it you should thank god that the answer is on the way one time daniel prayed and asked god to help him day after day went by nothing got better it looked like that god didnt even hear his prayer but on the st day an angel showed up and said daniel the first day you prayed god heard you and dispatched me with the answer but it took me days to fight through the forces of darkness what i want you to see is the first day you prayed god heard you the first time you asked god set the miracle into motion the very first day the answer was on the way thats why you dont have to keep praying about the same thing begging god asking again and again the answer is already on the way the promise is already in motion the breakthrough is already in route the right person is already in your future the victory is already up ahead of you you prayed about it now switch over into praise start thanking god that is coming start thanking him in advance for the healing the restoration the promotion the vindication the dream its headed your way you only need to ask god for it one time but then in all your future prayers you thank him does that make sense so you dont have to keep going please give it to me please give it to me please give it to me please like youre begging god no you just have to say god i want you to give this to me and then for the rest of the time until it arrives you just thank god thats faith some of you have prayed about the situation long enough youve got to switch over into praise get up every morning father thank you that my dreams are coming to pass thank you that healing is coming thank you that promotion is on its way thats whats going to keep you strong not begging not praying again and again no remember like daniel the first day you prayed god heard it and set the miracle into motion its already on the way as you keep giving god praise hes going to keep giving you strength to believe when are you going to start thanking god for that breakthrough in your life youve wanted it all your life but you havent been thanking god for it in advance you just been begging like you have to bargain or bribe or pressure god to say yes god wants to say yes hes waiting for you to show faith when are you going to thank god in advance when are you going to put the choir before the army in your life right now that many of you listening to me are just barely holding on its been a rough year and i want to tell you dont give up dont dont dont dont you dare give up hold on this too shall pass the tough stuff that youre going through it didnt come to stay it came to pass its not going to last the problems not going to last so dont give up on god dont give up on your marriage dont give up on your church dont give up on your dream dont give up dont give up look up look up jesus christ the son of god who created you who thought you up who loves you who has a purpose for your life who died on the cross for you who rose again and is coming back one day whos going to take you to heaven one day jesus christ is the secret of strength to make it to the end of your marathon and end well when we go through a bad season of life those circumstances that are oppressing us theyre very real but theres another reality and that reality that god is in the heavens and he is controlling and watching and all powerful over every circumstance in our life we have a choice are we going to focus on our circumstances or are we going to focus on our god things will start looking up when you start looking up in other words your circumstances will improve when you stop looking at them start looking to god let me say it again things start looking up when i start looking up you know in the bible theres a phrase thats used over and over and over and it is the phrase lift up your eyes said many many times in scripture its just one way of saying look up get your eyes off yourself and off your problems and off your circumstances and on to god refocus look at him things will start looking up when i start looking up when we look up and we see how big god is it naturally shrinks the size of our problems they just dont seem to be as big or as overwhelming when compared to the greatness of god i dont know what burdens youre bearing i dont know what grief or fear or anxiety or confusion you may be feeling right now but i do know this you need to look up instead of giving up dont give up look up in your disillusioned heart in your angst youve got your eyes focused on the wrong place until your eyes are fixed on the lord you wont be able to endure the days that go from bad to worse thats the key until your eyes are fixed on the lord you wont be able to endure the days that go from bad to worse the bible invites us over and over and over fix your eyes on me god says fix your eyes on me fix your eyes on me hebrews calls us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and the perfecter of our faith are you in the middle of a of a discouraging season fix your eyes friends fix your eyes back on jesus in a in a season of emotional pain fix your eyes on jesus do it once do it twice do it multiple times a day do it constantly throughout the day remember and rehearse who he is remember who he is remember what hes promised to do so when your schedules press when your prospects thin when your hope burns low when people disappoint you when events turn against you when dreams die when the walls close in when the prognosis is grim when your heart breaks because when life is crushing we dont have anywhere else to go because of who he is he will always do what is best for you now sometimes we have to talk ourselves off the ledge we have to remind ourselves of important truths like god knows what hes doing he doesnt make mistakes his timing is always perfect whatever is happening he is choosing to allow for this moment its challenging to trust and keep trusting but we have to because he is who he said he is and he will do what he says hell do this is the difference between ordinary people and great people great people never give up they never give up they keep on in the marathon of life even when theyre fatigued even when theyre frustrated even when they feel like failures and even when theyre fearful dont you dare friend give in without a fight fight back fight back against your discouragement fight back against the devil fight back against those who want to discourage you you got a great dream and at some point the devils whispers in your who do you think you are attempting to do this wrong question you should build your life not on what you think you can do but what you think god can do you let the size of your god determine the size of your goal its not about do you think i would have tried to do all things ive tried to do in life because i was depending on me not a chance in my flesh theyre dwelleth no good thing i know that i cant do certain things jesus said apart from me you can do nothing so thats pretty clear now how do you react when your plans take longer than expected when what you thought was going to take be done real quickly when you have a project and you go man this has taken me a long time to get through school its taken me a long time to get this thing built this has taken me what do you do you give in to selfpity you start complaining you start blaming other people friends if at first you dont succeed youre normal youre normal okay nobody succeeds at first the only way you actually succeed in life is by failing a bunch and learning what doesnt work failure is the stepping stone to success nobody ever succeeds without having failures success heres the difference between successful and unsuccessful people successful people see failure as a temporary setback unsuccessful people see it as a mark on their character well im a failure no no nobody succeeds at everything nobody has an unbroken record of success refocus on god stop listening to the negativity and resist the discouragement dont you give into it resist it fight it and who will give you the energy to fight it your lord and savior jesus christ so focus on him not on the problem when were at our worst gods at his best the stage is now set for god to work his will his way you see over and over again in the scriptures over and over again the stage is set for god to do his most amazing work when the situation looks the bleakest to us when you and i are fresh out of options when you and i are fresh uh uh at the at the end of our rope when you and i are at the end of ourselves and were full of fear and were full of uncertainty thats when god steps back rolls up his sleeves and starts to wow us again the challenge for us is not giving up too soon you know a lot of people start off great in life but even before they get to the halfway point in their life theyve already really messed it up and theyve given up which is worse than messing up here let me say it again giving up is always worse than messing up everybody messes up why do people give up in the marathon of their lives because they got discouraged choose to change the channel of your mind dont keep replaying all those discouraging images in your mind instead remember the lord choose to think about god and what hes faithfulness his love his mercy his compassion choose to think about god because your thoughts always determine your feelings do you want to stop being discouraged then stop thinking the way youve been thinking you know when bad days come into our lives we want gods to do something big something miraculous dont we our miraculous cure to the illness the immediate return of a prodigal the overnight breaking of a destructive addiction the erasure of the financial problems were suffering we want god to act dramatically and instantaneously sometimes he does that but usually thats not how it works its not in the big things instead its in that still small voice that god comes to give us courage to face that illness or the grace to accept that prodigals departure from god the ability the wisdom to handle the financial difficulty were experiencing thats how god speaks most often and when the waves are crashing and the winds are howling around us it is important that we learn how to listen to gods real but sometimes small voice in the midst of our bad season of life bad days are inevitable but they dont have to be paralyzing those who live a significant life learn to expect bad days and learn how to refresh themselves physically emotionally and spiritually you know i found that going through a bad season of life is a lot like traveling through a dark tunnel the bad news is in that tunnel it is dark you cant see in front of you you dont know if youll ever make it out but the good news is once youve entered into that dark tunnel with gods help youre already on the way out all of us run out of hope at some point am i right or wrong i think all of us do even that cup is half full sanguine soul who always goes around singing the sun will come up tomorrow even that person on occasion will reach up into the shelf for a can of hope and find there is no hope maybe thats where you are today maybe youre here more out of desperation than inspiration is there any hope are you asking that question youre running out of hope are you the single mom whos running out of hope are you the elderly person who has buried someone you love and your hope has left you are you the businessman who looks professional on the inside but its been a long time since you had a good nights sleep and you cant find peace are you running out of hope are you feeling like giving up are you close to despair dont do it dont the blackest moments we live through will last only a little time its pretty easy sometimes to to feel beaten that doesnt mean give up in fact it means the opposite it means its time for you to fight harder and im gonna tell you right now it wont be easy it will be hard because life is hard thats what life is and these challenges these challenges that you face theyre gonna do their best to take you down do not let them stand up dig in line up those problems and confront them face them fight them do not let them bring you down in fact in fact let those challenges raise you up let them elevate you let their demands and their trials make you stronger let the adversity you face today turn you into a better person tomorrow so so in the future you look back at these struggles and you say to them thank you you made me better you cannot keep a person down who wont stay down its one thing to be knocked down but the problem is you wont stay down there are already witnesses in this room who will testify its not that i havent been knocked down but god keeps giving me the strength the energy the wherewithal the anointing the power to not stay down that every time something or somebody knocks me down god keeps raising me back up see ladies and gentlemen life is not about not getting knocked down life is about not staying down you cant quit you come too far to quit now today i refuse to quit today i refuse to give up ive come too far to look back now amen has anyone else came too far to look back again we have come too far god has been far too good i refuse to quit no matter whats going on in our world today no matter what is going on in my temptations today no matter whats going on in my family with my friends at my job in my health i refuse to quit im not going to give up your situation may have changed your circumstances may have changed it may feel like its bigger it may feel like its greater but friend today our god has not changed he will never change the same god that helped you back then the same god that was with you in the beginning the same god that showed himself strong in your situation before is with you right now dont get this far down the road and turn around dont come this far dont overcome all those challenges and addictions and trials and what the world has thrown at you and then at this point in your life turn around its not worth it someone needs to hear this youre facing challenges youre facing addictions youre facing that affliction that temptation you need to refuse to quit you need to refuse to give up today some of you need to remember the history of victory that god has in your life do you remember all of those times where you said im not going to make it through this and look where youre at today i remember some of the darkest times of my life i would lay on the bed in tears i would lay on the bed sometimes without even words to pray and satan would whisper and say this is it this is the big one this is the last time youll ever have to go through this because your lifes going to be ending or this is going to ruin your entire life but guess what here i stand today but by the grace of god he delivered me time and time again and even when it seemed tough even when it seemed rough my god was faithful but see for some reason we go through a new storm we go through a new trial and we tend to forget all of the past and all of the times that god delivered us church today you need to remind yourself of the goodness of god there were things in my life that should have taken me out there were things in my life where i was going the wrong direction there were afflictions in my life that should have killed me but by the grace of god here i am today and you have the same story today church i want to encourage you theres been things in your life that should have taken you out but here you sit today breathing alive able to see able to talk able to walk because of the grace of god thats something to get excited about today we have a history of victory if god says you can make it guess what you can make it and you will make it no matter how negative it looks today youre going to come back its time to get up off the mat if youve been knocked down if youve been through something if youve been through financial setback or some kind of terrible thing has hit you in your health and or somethings happened to your family we need to believe that its time for a comeback its no time to quit its no time to give up its no time to moan and groan we may be down but were not out because we serve a comeback god and i want you to know the attitude of our god is im not going to give up on anybody im preaching to some people who have fallen behind and the enemys whispering to you give up the devil wants you to think its gone forever whatever it is that he stole from you its gone forever but it is not gone forever because god is planning you a comeback that if theres breath in our lungs hes not finished with us yet no matter how old you are no matter how bad youve missed it no matter how bad things look dont worry gods not finished yet if you havent seen the breakthrough gods not finished yet if you havent seen the miracle if things havent turned around for the good dont worry gods not finished see gods not setting us up to leave us halfway finished hes not setting us up to not finish what he started no he wants to bring us to a flourishing finish which means that our best days are right in front of us some of us in this room maybe weve had failed businesses failed marriages maybe weve made some bad mistakes and we think to ourselves gods done with me god cant use me hes not going to use me in ministry again hes not going to give me another business i declare bankruptcy you need to stop accepting those selflimiting beliefs those selflimiting lies those god limiting lies we serve a god whos never finished when theres breath in our lungs god can turn things around he can get you on the right track and i think many of us in this room have accepted limits that god didnt put on us we put on ourselves weve accepted caps that other people have said over this you cant do that youre too young youre too old gods done with you you messed up you screwed up you missed it youll never get out of this weve got to break those limitations off because weve accepted that we cant we wont and because we wont well never realize that we actually can today is the day to stir up that hunger to say with god all things are possible i can do all things through christ who strengthens me,1.0

feeling powerless stressed a positive message from prof wolff economic update,prof wolff shares why he believes we can make big changes to capitalism even during such a difficult time its been done before,i want to address particularly today those of you that have felt at one moment or another over recent weeks months even years a kind of sadness maybe even a touch of depression about how things are developing especially here in the united states but globally quite a few folks been feeling powerless not clear about a way forward and yet deeply and increasingly distressed by the rising inequality the instability the polarizing political hostilities everywhere and are upset and rightly so by right wing impulses and movements that come to the force and wondering and worrying about a way forward is there one what might it be i want with you to go through a moment of american history when that kind of feeling was widespread and was overcome because i want to leave you with the lesson what we were able to do before we can do again only even better this time so i want to go back about a hundred years to the s and s to talk about what happened there the s were a time of despair and upset covered over by a kind of frenetic energy the frenetic energy was captured in the phrase the roaring twenties which is what people talked about the image was of flappers dancing the image was of excess the image was of of parties in florida as the land was gobbled up for resorts and all of that but the truth is people were becoming increasingly depressed and for good reason the labor movement in those years was tired and old it had fought valiant struggles at the end of the th century and into the beginning of the th there had been the explosion of interest in the american socialist party and its leader eugene victor debs but the war world war one and the decline of the socialist party and the tired decline of the labor movement left people in the kind of mood they are in now thats why im picking it but something amazing happened in the s an entirely new labor movement exploded onto the scene we had literally the opposite in the s called the cio relative to what we had had before the afl the afl organized skilled workers into relatively small units who were able to get because they were skilled decent wages since it was difficult for an employer to replace a skilled worker with someone off the street the cio congress of industrial organizations started by john l lewis the head of the mine workers union in america said its sights on all workers skilled semiskilled unskilled industry by industry and across the s they organized millions they became much bigger than the afl but more importantly they showed working people that if you get together and you set your sights on it you can do something in the united states that people had despaired of doing organizing millions of people into labor unions that were militant and powerful there is no reason to believe that what we in fact accomplished in the united states in the s and s that transformation cannot be done again likewise with an older tired labor movement being upstaged if you like by a surging new one its happened before it can happen again,1.0

bringing the fight to trump how vp kamala harris candidacy has energized american politics,claire mccaskill former senator from missouri and charlie sykes msnbc contributor and columnist joins nicolle wallace on,hi everyone hi everyone its in the east take one supremely qualified elected leader throw in a positive and optimistic message about the future some popular policy achievements and ideas for the future a dash of beyonce and what do you get a rousing start to a presidential campaign against a aud democrat and convicted felon with a doom and gloom earth vision of the country he seeks to lead vice president kamala harris is out with her first campaign video stressing the battle for democracy and freedom that lies ahead and the stark contrast with donald trump take a listen in this election we each face a question what kind of country do we want to live in there are some people who think we should be a country of chaos of fear of hate but us we choose somethingdifferent different we choose freedom the freedom not just to get by but get ahead the freedom to be safe from gun violence the freedom to make decisions about your own body we choose a future where no child lives in poverty where we can all afford health care where no one can above the law we believe in the promise of america and we are ready to fight for itbecause when we fight we win because when we fight we win so join us its a fitting quota to joe bidens address to the nation explaining his decision to end his run for a second term heres a bit i decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation its the best way to unite our nation theres a time and place for long years of experience in public life theres also a time and place for new voices fresh voices yes younger voices that time and place is now that time and place is now having galvanized the democratic base and sent the trump team scrambling in search of something anything effective with which to attack kamala harris the presidents anointed successor kamala harris has been taking a message grounded in this idea of freedom and a fight for the future and the rule oflaw to the the campaign trail law to the the campaign trail with four events in four states in four days her latest appearance a speech to the american federation of teachers where she said the expresident would return america to a dark past watch that in this moment across our nation we witness a fullon attack on hard won hard fought freedoms while you teach students about democracy and representative government extremists attack the sacred freedom to vote while you try to create safe and welcoming places where our children can learn extrooesemis attack our freedom to live safe from gun violence they have the nerve to tellteachers to strap on a gun in teachers to strap on a gun in the classroomwhile they refuse to pass common while they refuse to pass common sense gun safety laws and while you teach students about our nations past these extremists attack the freedom to learn and acknowledge our nations true and full history including book bans book bans in this year of our lord and on these last two issues just think about it we want to ban assault weapons and they want to ban books can you imagine in this moment we are in a fight for our most fundamental freedomsto this room of leaders i say to this room of leaders i say bring itten bring it on bring it on president biden officially passing the torch to vice president kamala harris in a campaign that sees the presidential election as a battle for freedom and the future is where we start today former us senator host of msnbc how to win podcast claire mccaskill is back also joining us is columnist charlie sykes is here and political analyst and senior opinion writer and columnist for the boston globe kim ekenstore is back she has grabbed these two pillars in terms of branding these early days of her candidacy they are freedom and future she is i think the most disciplined candidate i have ever watched shes got her crowds chanting correspondent tanspontaneously t back this is a stellar start yes to say she was ready is an understatement i think people for way too long and we have talked about this before for way too long undermined kamala harris in ways i never really quite understood as somebody who knows her well and worked alongside of her in the united states senate frankly one of the things i find most fun about this is the struggle the republicans are having the things they are pointing out as negatives the online community is taking and turning into a positive like laughter i think our country is ready for joy instead of grievance we are ready for lightness instead of dark we are ready for all of the things shes bringing to this campaign youre right this organic chant i dont think maybe people remember that all fired up ready to was organic that happened organically in the obama campaign i was fascinated by we wont go back which happened organically in her first speech as a candidate i predict we wont go back will in fact be the chant that sticks around from now until the first tuesday in november charlie sykes let me show you more of herment hammering this future vs past message this is from her speech today today we face a choice between two very different visions of our nation one focused on the future andthe other focused on the past the other focused on the past and we are fight inging for the future and in our vision of the future we see a place where every person has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead a future where no child has to grow up in poverty where every senior can retire with dignity pretty clear what this campaign is about its really dramatic this is going to be a tough campaign because you still have a lot of head winds here but i have been thinking all day long where we were one week ago right now sitting in milwaukee what the mood among republicans was and what the mood among democrats was and it feels like the entire political world has been turned on its head because what youre seeing is the shift in the entire focus of this race to what kind of a future are we going to have in a way that frankly joe biden wasnt going to be able to do that he wasnt going to bring that energy you werent going to see this kind of enthusiasm and this passing of the torch has been close to seamless which again was not necessarily inevitable a weak ago so a week ago we were thinking what is this election going to be like could it be a republican blowout and today i dont think theres any precedent for the kind of quick start enthusiasm were seeing now but think about the election in d john f kennedy bill clinton talking about change think about when barack obama was the voice of change this feels far more like that now than at any time in this campaign so the campaign we were all gurding for and dreading has now been utterly and completely transform eded im not down playing the challenges and what the republicans will do to try to define kamala harris but the fact that dont also the sleep on the fact that shes given four big speeches in four days the energy that shes bringing to this and the organic enthusiasm im always the trying to balance out whats hype and whats real this is pretty extraordinary what youre seeing on the ground and in social media its all very real i think there has been a hunger since to see the fight brought to donald trump in exactly this manner to move as love is light torks,1.0

trump losing again s nightmare comes true as his nemesis obama backs kamala harris,former president obama and former first lady obama endorse vice president kamala harris presidential bid and msnbcs ari,starts now we are reporting on be a ram obamas entry into the raisece playing a unique role in the democratic party he makes it official for kamala harris today former president obama tapped biden on his ticket reviving the career of a senator who had run for president twice obama was a much discussed but seldom publicly heard presence during these debates about whether president biten en biden do what he did last week the unusual measure after having clinched the nomination of stepping aside throughout that process in public toobama backed him another contrast clinton backed harris immediately last weekend when this went down obama held back he is coming in as a ceremonial closer kamala harris has the delegates she has the party leaders i bet you know that now tonight she has barack and michelle obama the harris campaign breaking the news with this endorsement video i cant have this folk khan without phone call without saying to my girl kamala i am proud of youthis is going to be historic this is going to be historic we call to say michelle and i couldnt be prouder to endorse endorsend awe getendorse you and get you into the oval office this means so much to me im looking forward to doing this with the two of you doug as i bothgetting out there being on the getting out there being on the road thats a call you take the obamas are the most popular in our national politics consider both barack and michelle obama have higher approval than the current president biden and then former president trump and higher than most nationally known candidates whether you want to pick mcconnell or schumer im not saying this to draw attention to it or to compliment thement or anything them or anything like that we have fractured politics we have divided politics kamala harris is ending the week not only with big democrats but with two of the most popular people in american politics period that means they could be key on the road in the campaign trail in or so diasay days ahead obama is credited kwa eded harri fortitude fortitude a little context kamala harris was out there helping his campaign back in captured by this photo whoever took it didnt know they were looking at the future vice president and democraticnominee nominee that was iowa new years ear she was celebrating a win at the iowa caucus she was on film at one point here its easy to forget how many people doubted you can see her there how the firstterm senator obama was doubted whether he could win the white population of the white caucus competition he did that catapulted his march to the nomination he served ace edd as a sounding kamala harris obama himself has spoken about something these two figures have in common how harris has faced the challenges and the secondguessing that comes with being a first in any field and especially in politics with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for president of the united states one thing we learned over the last several years is that the challenges that women face as women are profound just as race is a profound in addition our society america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many vet ralerans care for and an economy to fix women of color have to deal with both the good news is that kamala is accustom to it she has been a first before kamala has been a first before quote unquote lets be clear something barack obama and kamala harris has noted history lives on you dont get there overnight the big news tonight the fact of americas first black president endorsing first black women nominee comes on the work of so many other trailblazers from obama himself to jezsse jackson to barbara jordan to senator braun to mayor foley the nation is sharing something as we end this week its worth noting on this first draft of history as we call journalism the nation is experiencing the reality of another barrier falling at least for a major party nomination some of this excitement for different people who bring different experiences to it might be something so real so palpable so organic if you want to use that word that people didnt know how they would feel about it until it happened its happening that is the nomination part whether this barrier or glass ceiling is crushed in november at the white house is yet to be seen thats up to the voters there are signs of momentum women for harris smashing records for the largest zoom call ever over people on it zoom had plenty of pandemic practice to get going at one point the load was so intense the cause froze joked i when kamala harris broke zoom people are making their own internet memes and posts about it if you are not a big meme making if you are not super hit thats okay think of what im showing you as virtual yard signs people make their own videos they put their own text on it they can be reshared its a fun or funny way to join in a year where so many people especially young people did not feel there were great political choices for them the excitement is palpable its a contrast to where this campaign was say seven days ago when it ended a rough week many people felt that they were caught with a choice between two candidates who they viewed as a sign of the past a contrast to what im showing you here the singer pink who has done good things including acrobatic performances i wanted to remind you of her work and fan base she leaped back in if you will into politics bringing her energy to the same recordbreaking zoom i mentioned i felt like good can win i felt like love can win i felt for the first time in a while okay okay we can do this for the first time in a while democrats are hoping that kind of feeling that can do it energy will power them and that obama embrace the big news tonight politically could propel harris towards obamas winning coalition thats where the political math coming in when obama first ran he didnt just persuade the existing pool of voters to come towards him he and his campaign changed and expanded the electorate with young and firsttime voters we are here in week one i will tell you because were counting there are no obama level registration numbers yet why would there be its just a couple days theres a surge of new voters registrations new voters have registered in the past week most importantly the majority of them over are under years old that matters this is the outlines of if you replicate that in the right states because we know its going to come down to key states the kind of thing that can change the math if you have gotten tired of hearing about the persuadable voters or hatders or how could you recruit a trump voters then you might like this its not about all those previous voters new vote rrz new some of them based on the first week i will give you the numbers we are not there yet at the obama level but on the first week there are voters who appear to be motivated toregister to vote because of register to vote because of kamala harris this week will they vote i dont know we will follow that this is what the democrats see as the big up side there are fundamentals this is why biden was seen as on track to lose and why any candidate replacing him but its now harris why any such candidate would have ground to make up many voters are still in a sour mood they are concerned about the same things they were concerned about a week ago these concerns perceptions feelings about rising prices and inflation and how hard to get by even if the macro inflation numbers are good and president biden mentioned that about handing off to a new generation people still feel that way theres an antiincumbent sentiment its hurting incumbents this many countries shes tied to biden she will run on some of the achievements she goes against those headwinds against incumbents she gets started republicans have also already been going outspending democrats by believe it or not to on the airwaves ap reporting how democrats havedropped million while the gop dropped million while the gop has plowed in million if you compare it its a mismatch they are trying to even up the news is not going to stop politics are not going to stop here is the thing so off whnpeople say that they are people say that they are talking about bad news im not here to tell you everything is changed we are ending with a transformed presidential race where a heck of a lot of people in ways we can measure seem excited about registers to vote about getting on the zoom calls about going out to campaign rallies talking to each other about what were going to do theres other things that i want to share with you theres a surge online that,0.0
the system that fuels media negativity,get four bonus months when purchasing a two year nordvpn plan by signing up at watch jet lag,the end might not be near doom might not be inevitable but not according to the news al jazeera aftera weekend of dramatic white house emergency actions us president bbc joe bidenhas given the go ahead for a controversial oil drilling scheme environmentalists say its a carbon bomb indigenous groups warning it will damage localwildlife pbs newshour and despite a wet winter in the west persistentdrought and overdevelopment cause record low water levels for tens of millions of americans imagine a forest imagine it s your home it s both your shelter and your source ofsustenance it offers rocks to make axes timber to buildshelters but most importantly berries and nuts and ducks and all sorts of food butto get to it you have to go out out is scary out is where the threats are you re on a path your sightlines are limited this forces you to walk to search as a necessity for survival to find thefood that will feed you your mate or your child that will ensure a slightly alteredcopy of your dna gets copied once again to keep the species alive you need to treadinto the unknown so you walk and you search and you walkand you search and you walk and you search and you walk and you bear there s a bear epinephrine cortisol your heart rate spikesbreathing quickens blood vessels contract digestion stops your vision focuses your pupils dilate yourhearing drops out your muscles tense and within an instant your body has reworkeditself reprioritized resources switching from a physiological state suited to exploringto one that can best assess address or evade a threat this splitsecond moment of identifying athreat has occurred immeasurable times through human history ending in immeasurable differentoutcomes but each of these outcomes can be categorized into one of two categories survivalor death extraneous factors altered each a slipperyrock slowed a retreat a convenient cave offered refuge a blunt spear inhibited a defense butwhen summing the total of those immeasurable instances there was a pattern the degree of that physiological responsecorrelated to the likelihood of survival how well muscles tensed how much vision focusedhow quickly cortisol released all this mattered to whether or not a human survived an encounterwith a threat so through the totality of humanity the dna that created humans withstronger response to the negative was more likely to get recreated through offspring that s evolution but that s also a theory what we do know with certainty is that today shumans respond more strongly to a negative stimulus than a positive one even when thosetwo stimuli are objectively equal in weight think back to high school what do you rememberthe great jokes you told or all the awkward encounters this disproportionate response is somethingthat we can and have proved time and time again in academic research so we call itthe negativity bias but what we can t directly prove is whetherthis is something natural something rooted in our dna crafted by evolution or if it scultural maybe society overemphasizes negative moments maybe the awkward encounters from middle schoolreally did have more of an impact on others perception of us than the great jokes andso we ve learned to react to them appropriately but evolution leaves its fingerprintsand natural experiments can search for them certain humans are male certain others arefemale and the most critical component of evolution is reproduction during human pregnancy the evolutionary influenceof parental death differs depending on whether it occurs to a father or mother if a father dies the likelihood of reproductivesuccess does go down there s then only one individual in a diminished physical stateto find food and fight off threats but there s still a chance if the mother dies however that s it reproduction fails evolution stops but simultaneously in an era when pregnancywas far more perilous than today reproductive success went up when food was more plentiful therefore the chance of a father s dnagetting passed on increased as they found more food but to do so they couldn t betoo worried about the negative the threats they needed to be motivated to take the levelof risk that optimizes for finding the most food possible even if it increases theirchances of death meanwhile the mother with far higher andmore direct evolutionary pressure to survive must first and foremost focus on her and herchild s survival her fight or flight response needs to be hugeso she s able to best respond to any threat that she might encounter when studied the facts support this theorymale humans exhibit a weaker negativity bias than female ones they still have the bias they still responddisproportionately to the negative but not quite as strongly it seems like evolution worked crafting astructure that appropriately optimized for the greatest likelihood of successful reproduction so the case is made as best we can tellthe negativity bias was not learned it was evolved it s natural the positive just doesn t elicit the sameemotional response in humans and there s not a whole lot we can do about it becauseit is literally rooted in our the dna that developed before farming and restaurants andelectricity and supermarkets and telephones and tv and the internet and the informationoverload that inundated us far faster than evolution could possibly respond we are dumb monkeys using our dumb monkeybrains to trick other dumb monkeys into giving other dumb monkeys attention and there snothing we can do about it so we react more quickly and with more forceto the negative it follows then that our eyes are naturallydrawn first toward the day s bad news but the trend toward the negative starts evenbefore you the consumer it begins with the journalist subject to the same natural negativity biasit s more likely that what a journalist ends up pitching to their editor takes ona negative slant subconsciously it just feels more important to cover more excitingto follow and carries more potential to captivate an audience this negative lean of course goes up theline influencing the editor that then greenlights the story the news institution that publishesthe story and the award juries that recognize exceptional work next the negativity bias gets rewarded bythe public it supplies a demand receiving clicks viewsengagement outrage and attention from people who can t help but react to the bad news it s all pretty intuitive bad news proliferatesbecause it s biologically what reporters are drawn to report on and consumers are drawnto consume but none of this explains why some country smedia is more negative than others that has less to do with human nature andmore with how a society goes about making news among journalists there s surprisinglylittle consensus as to what exactly is defined as news sure there s a dictionary definition butit s so broad that it might be easier to identify what news isn t than is a functional definition on the other handhas proved hard to come by and harder to agree on to some journalists news is news when itfits into one or more of these particular identifiable bins for others the list slightly differs for others still the notion of even tryingto qualify what actually counts as news is too much to ask you know it when you seeit it simply is zoom out further and questions become morevexing what is news for is it entertainment ora public service whose role is it to produce and provide thenews the state or independent organizations who does the news serve stakeholders shareholdersthe state the public but while these questions might keep academicsup at night media institutions answer them every moment of every day with every piecethey publish offering through example after example of exactly what that particular societyhas decided to define as news and the purpose of news for decades critical onlookers have scannedamerica s proprivate hypercompetitive forprofit media landscape and have drawntwo broad conclusions it tends to be more negative than most and it s getting morenegative what s been more difficult though was provingto what extent if any us media skewed more negatively than other nations with different events impacting differentcountries afterall and with different cultural assumptions as to what different events meanit s nearly impossible drawing a clean comparison between any two nation s media maybein a bigger country there s just too much bad happening to leave airtime for the good well that was until one story came to impactevery single media market on the planet at the exact same time really like no other phenomena before itthe covid pandemic and its near universal weight offered the rarest of opportunitiesto compare media tone across countries some identified the chance and in early this paper analyzing and comparing englishlanguage stories approach to reporting on the pandemicwent public collecting some covid articles fromthese sources in the us and these sources abroad the researchers traced the prevalenceof negative words and terms to predict the negative slant of each the results were staggering this is the negativity trend in internationalsources across much of hovering steadily around then this is the us media whose covidcoverage leaned negative at a whopping across the study and this vast gulf between just how bad thenews is in the us versus the rest of the world is only exacerbated by these additional findingsthat the nation s most popular news sources trend even more negative than average performers clearly the negativity bias is working fuelinga vicious cycle that will only lead to more and more and more of it and this all feelslike a problem but maybe it s not maybe it s just a thing after all this is natural maybe negativity is just how we communicate maybe it s even a good thing we talk aboutour issues meaning we find ways to address them or maybe it can be both a simultaneous sourceand stymie of progress consider it theoretically say negative news gets just more attention first one must consider that it s an armsrace there are only so many eyeballs so when the success metric is eyeballs in a competitivenews industry any edge be it little will get captured so a attention edge will lead to or or more negative news because if everyone else is doing it then everybodyhas to do it it s an exponential effect next say there are two stories but there sonly time for one the first is on a brand new vaccine a miraclecure something that will improve one s odds of survival by the second is on a crime wave a shootingspree something that ll decrease the odds of survival by in this theoretical environment that secondstory wins it s scarier it s more dramatic it s going to keep the eyeballs from switchingto that other channel this will kill people the crime wave might stop the attention mightlead to intervention but all the while more people are dying of a preventable diseasean epidemic that could have been stopped if only people had heard of that new miraclecure in our heads problems feel far more significantthan potential we d much rather solve a problem than capture potential early in the covid pandemic there was nonews but covid news but not all was negative there were times when things got better for every upslope there was a downslope butyou could hardly tell based on the news research into the matter found that the degreeof negativity of covid news had little in fact sometimes inverse correlation withthe covid case count at the given moment this meant that while a news consumer mighthave theoretically known that things were comparatively better or worse it didn tnecessarily feel that way since the tone of the media inputs stayed consistently dire this did have an impact now with retrospect we understand the costof covid precautions precautions got in the way of precautionsthe persistence of mask mandates and school closures and border restrictions led to achanging calculus of when these should have been implemented in the public s minds think of it like this if a town will haveonly tolerated months of mask mandates over months of the pandemic they probablyshould have been applied here as hospitalizations and deaths were rising most quickly but ratheron average they were applied here at the start just stretching until tolerance wanedmeaning a limited supply of precaution was wasted on times when cases were naturallywaning of course this sort of rationality can onlybe applied in retrospect but it demonstrates the impact we were incapable of properlyassessing risk perhaps in part because our information inputs didn t modulate tonein step with the risk things always felt at their worst so it neverfelt like the moment for a reprieve take another dramatically different exampleresearch has demonstrated that us presidents in elections for a second term are penalizedmore for a worsening economy than rewarded for an improving one that s to say making the economy worsematters a lot more to the electorate than making the economy better possibly becausethe public hardly knows when things are getting better the media doesn t talk about itonly the reverse but what the electorate should optimize foris the president who is best at improving the economy and so this skew means there sever so slight irrationality in how we assess a politician we ve potentially voted out presidentsand more often other politicians irrationally because we don t have an understanding oftheir accomplishments it s a game of who s more terrible rather than who s the best so the news operates as perhaps a distortedfunhouse mirror of society it is mostly accurate it mostly conveys thetruth but weighting matters the public makes inferences based on the quantityand frequency of information and so this distorted mirror does inject irrational informationinto both democratic and individual decisionmaking there are interventions we know this becausewe know this negativity bias is at its worst in the us australia and the uk for example are closecultural cousins to the us and yet their media tends to be far less negative perhaps the most notable difference in theirmedia landscape is the dominance of public broadcasters the australian and british broadcasting corporationsare incredibly influential in shaping public opinion in their respective countries anddo so without needing to so fiercely compete to attract eyeballs they can optimize for quality of informationover eyeballs attracted as their funding is less directly tied to quantity of eyeballs they each rely on money from the public fundedthrough the government meaning the metric of success is providing a service the publicconsiders worthwhile but inevitably everyone s definition ofworthwhile is different true autonomy from the government while relyingon politicians to continue to authorize funding is nearimpossible to achieve and publicbroadcasters constantly face scandals for failing to properly critique those who writetheir checks so while negativity might be lower some mightask at what cost true media autonomy is essentially impossibleunder a public funding model true tone balance is essentially impossible under an adsupportedmodel there s really no perfect option and at the end of the day it s not a questionof if there s negativity bias just how much when we look into a distorted funhouse mirrorwe don t think our heads actually look that big or our stature is actually that shortor our hips are actually that wide because we know that s not reality we ve seen ourselves in normal mirrors sowe know what we actually look like but if you never saw yourself through a normalmirror if the funhouse option was it you might know that your head and height and hipsare not that size but slowly you d forget by just how much you d forget what you actually look likeblind to yourself left only with the choice of avoiding the mirror rejecting any sortof selfreflection or accepting a flawed image because it s really the only mirroryou have access to information is undoubtedly importantand there has perhaps never been a more powerful tool for this than the internet but as the power of the internet has increasedthere s been a worrying trend towards its nationalization the internet should be the exact same no matterwhere you are but it s not there are an increasing number of censorship

trump fail jd vance st vp with negative favorability in years,get your copy of aim for the uprights at jd vance is the first vice presidential pick to have net,speaker if you go back years to jd vance you know thespeaker guy weve endorsed jp great jd mandel that guyspeaker he is the first vice presidential running mate with net negative favourability youve got to go back to jd vance wasnt even alive at the time so the starting point here for me with vance was all right lets evaluate this election does vance bring new voters to trump does he expand the electorate for trump in any way it doesnt seem like it at all doesnt seem like i mean listen trumps going to win ohio almost certainly ohios not really been in play for democrats for a while now so maybe he makes trump win by a slightly larger margin in ohio and thats a maybe but vance doesnt help trump in arizona vance doesnt help to help trump and you know north carolina to the extent that maybe you could pull that off so the point here is it doesnt seem vance brings trump anything were now realizing that vance may actually be detrimental to donald trump he may actually be a net loss of votes for trump and the new favorability numbers propose exactly that cnn political analyst did a segment where he said i dont understand the pick neither do american voters he breaks down jd or jps popularity ratings and the average vp popularity since the year is plus now the way you get that is you say favorable minus unfavorable and on average favorable is points ahead of unfavorable jd is underwater he is a minus six the percentage of the country that sees him unfavorably exceeds that which sees him favorably by six percentage points harry enten says jd vance is making history the wrong way you know one of the problems with these smug pricks is they dont realize that theyre coming off like smug pricks very transparently and people dont like them and that sort of seems to be whats going on here heres a funny little just a short clip of an interview that cnn did with a pennsylvania voter who is not thrilled with the selection of jd vance how do you feel about speaker trumpsspeaker vp pick jd vance hes kind of like a little loud and obnoxious yes he settled down a bit speaker yeah loud and obnoxious that may be maybe so theres a few different reasons that we like this if we are against trump getting four more years as president the reason number one that vance being unpopular is good is that maybe it hurts trump second reason that jd vance being unpopular is good it will anger trump as reportedly he was about to select doug burgum governor doug burgum to be his running mate and these are reports right they are they true were not sure but it is being pretty widely reported that trump was about to select doug burgum to be his running mate who might not add to the campaign but would not detract in the way that jd vance seems to actively be detracting and a combination of don jr and or eric trump convince their dad absolutely do not go with doug burgum go with jd vance and if that is the way that it ended up that way trump presumably would be maybe mad at his kids but more importantly sees the headlines sees the unfavorably sees jd vance completely fail at every campaign event and this will trigger him and send him down an even more extreme downward spiral which could then have the follow on kind of signal boosting vicious circle effect of hurting the campaign even more so im quite pleased with the selection of jd vance from the standpoint of hurting trump and it seems the polling is going the exact same way,0.0
watch trump rally full speech at st cloud campaign event livenow from fox,former president donald trump as well as his running mate jd vance focused heavily on crime the economy and immigration,listen in i dont know tom you better bring this home theres no excuse theres no excuse tom emmer great guy were going to bring this home i want to thank everybody i want to thank our next vice president of the united states jd m and i before we begin i want to condemn the evil attack on israel that took place earlier today a missile launched by hezbollah killed at least a dozen children young children and they were playing as you heard on a soccer field in israeli territory on the golan heights a place that i recognized during my administration as under israels sovereignty it was a big thing theyve been trying to get it done for years i got it done in about hour the savage that iranian precision missile dozens more were wounded in the attack and sadly the death toll is probably going to go very substantially higher our hearts go out to the families of these innocent children no parent should have to suffer the terrible loss of a child at the hands of terrorists or anybody else todays attack on israel cannot be forgotten and it will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective united states president and vice president they wouldnt have done this if i were the president they wouldnt have done it with time the situation will only get worse for our country with the kind of leadership that we have right now which is no leadership its probably worse than no leadership its negative its negative leadership it must galvanized republicans democrats independents conservatives progressives libertarians and everybody else to put strength respect and power back into the usa where it belongs this attack just like the attack on october th or the ukraine russia war think of it nor would country busting inflation you know inflation is destroying our country none of it would have happened it would have never happened if we if we were president it wouldnt have happened its a dangerous and terrible time for the world and its almost the entire fault of incompetent biden harris administration she who says that she wasnt the borders are she wasnt the borders are for years she was the borders are she let it be on i am the borders are then she never went to the border these are shes terrible shes worse shes worse than he is ill tell you right now i want to be nice they all say i think hes changed i think hes changed since weeks ago something affected him know i havent changed maybe ive gotten worse actually because i get angry at the incompetence that i witness every single day the way millions of people are pouring into our country and thats the thing that must change and it must change quickly its great to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud hardworking american patriots as you know days ago we officially defeated the worst president in the history of the united states crooked joe biden have you heard of him he was badly beaten and everybody went to him and said joe you cant win you cant win he said no no let me debate him let me debate him pleased that didnt work out too well either that was the end the debate was the end you cant beat him joe now we just beat you joe youre going to lose you got to get out we want to get out you got to get out joe there was nothing nice about what they were doing it wasnt democracy was it it wasnt democracy were saying we want you out of the race joe and we want you out here youre going to lose the quotes from some of the fake news look at all the fake news back there well thats a lot of fake news man thats a lot of fake news mike joe youre going to somebody else in and then i realized last night i was speaking to a great group of people christians all christians and theyve been horribly treated by this administration today i spoke to bitcoin crypto so i went from christians to bitcoin and now im with you in minnesota we cover a lot of territory think of that so christians the bitcoin to minnesota we cover a lot of territory and i never mess it up by saying let me tell you about bitcoin i dont do that though remember biden of course i dont want to talk too much about him but when he was in iowa and he said its great to be in idaho no no youre in if i ever did that once it would be the end it says thats the end hes cognitively impaired that would be the end of the fake news would go crazy but i thought last night as i was speaking to this incredible group of evangelicals and a lot of others of faith its uh well you like that dont you huh wow that means our country is coming a long way because you put faith back you put religion back into our country its going to be a much better place when i thought last night i said you know its sort of unfair you have a guy who says hes great hes president and all that stuff they rigged the election but we wont talk about that until you see they say hes president comes out raring to go and he gets badly beaten hes losing and all of a sudden hes like a fighter hes losing then they took him out of the fight and they put a new fighter we have a new victim now kamala we have a name for you we have a brand new victim and honestly shes a radical left lunatic and she is when you find out about her all i have to say is defund the police that was her big thing lets defund the police you know politicians dont change whatever they say first thats where they are they dont change when you say that tom whatever they say if they said years ago years ago different from the police she said it like years ago or years ago but so if thats what they say thats ultimately their where they want to go but this was really a coup of and by the democrats this was a coup of a man that had million votes he wanted to run they wouldnt let him run they treated him horribly they said to him we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way did you oh hes president this was a coup with the presidency they threatened him with the th amendment they said joe were going to threaten you with the thing called the th amendment youre cognitively and physically a mess and if you dont get out were going to take you out with the th amendment and he said ill go and then the fake news said oh he was so brave he was so brave no he was forced to leave so now we have a new candidate to defeat the most incompetent unpopular and farleft vice president in american history probably the most farleft person in american history less than months from now minnesota is going to defeat kamala harris and we remember what i said its short time ago short time ago she strongly fought for many many bad things but to me i love the police were not the funding them were going to fund them over a fund them shes just thinking shes defund the police and im over the police were going to overthrow were going to evict this radical and incompetent administration from the white house and together we are going to make a america great again with your vote this election illegal aliens will be turned back the cartels will be in retreat crime will fall energy prices will plummet incomes will soar at a world in chaos will rapidly be transformed into a planet of peace and very importantly and you dont hear this anymore the words you dont hear under the trump administration the american dream will come roaring back bigger better and stronger than ever before the american dream welcome back right but if a crazy liberal and shes beyond liberal look she was a failure at every stop she was a failed vice president she was a horrible district attorney she destroyed san francisco she was a liberal from she was there before all the guys that you currently reading about right if a crazy liberal like kamala harris gets in the american dream is dead i believe its dead i believe its dead over the past and a half years borders are harris which is what she called herself even the new york times today theyre they took an article out of the new york times borders are now you know theyre deleting everything that back there are deleting everything but we already have it months ago she was thought of so badly they were just killing her and now that shes in this position theyre trying to make her into a i dont think so its not going to happen margaret thatcher didnt laugh like that did she did she know if she did she wouldnt thatcher its very simple right borders are harris allowed almost million illegal aliens to stampede into our country if she gets another years itll be to million more people in our country and theyll be using medicare and social security they will be theyll be destroyed they wont be a thing your government can do about it she will kill social security and medicare as vice president kamala harris cast the tiebreaking votes that created the worst inflation in half a century i believe the worst inflation that weve ever had you know they dont dont use the numbers that are really really bad but theyre bad enough to have the worst just about that anybody can ever even think of or remember decimating working families and if she wins inflation will only get worse its going to get worse already energy and gasoline are going up you and more per gallon we had it down to a dollar we actually had it lower than that for a period of time hey pamela harris presidency means more years of extremism weakness failure chaos and probably world war iii i really believe it they have no thats why this happened today in israel shocking that it happened out of nowhere a trump victory will bring back leadership confidence common sense and strength to the oval office this is what we had we had no wars we had no wars think of them we have no wars remember when crooked hillary clinton used to say hes going to get us into a war look rhetoric i said no my rhetoric is going to keep us out of war thats what happened we had no wars they didnt think about it got in iran was broke i told china if you buy told barrel of oil from iran youre not doing any more business in the united states and they didnt buy any they didnt buy in and we would have had to deal with iran within week after the election of the election didnt take know we got millions more votes the second time that we did the first the new york times asked me what happened the second time i said the second time we got like million more votes right oh i never thought of that the reporters said oh yeah youre right actually lets lets go to another carlos insanely liberal record as a senator she was ranked the number most radical left democrat in the entire senate they look like a moderate he was unhappy with that today did you see he said oh no no i think i might have been more more liberal than her they were fighting over whos more liberal if this country has a liberal president at this country is finished okay just so you know and shes weak liberal just a few years ago kamala harris cosponsored bernie sanders trillion dollars you know what that means that means file for bankruptcy as youre signing the legislation everything is gone your taxes will go up by or times and it still wont be nearly enough trillion dollar socialist takeover of the entire us health care system she endorsed outlawing private health insurance entirely many people have private health insurance its phenomenal if they work hard and they want to have great health insurance she wanted it outlawed she supported giving free taxpayer funded health care to all illegal aliens come on in come on now but just to our country including from prisons mental institutions insane asylums you know that go crazy when i mentioned dr hannibal lecter you know who that was they say what does he keep mentioning hannibal lecter well you see he was a slightly troubled patient in an insane asylum and hed love to have you for lift everything but i mentioned him because we have people like that coming into our country theyre closing their insane asylums all over the world theyre sending their states venezuela and crime is down because theyre sending their criminals and their drug dealers and their prisoners to the united think instead of being here which is a a great place i love this place well go to venezuela or someplace in south america where theyve sent all their criminals to us because well have a nice safe event we can go to venezuela next year with a crime dropped and were going to have a nice safe event because in minnesota you will have lots of people that you dont have now although many of them are here now they just sort of getting used to it youll have people from their jails and from their mental so well go to a nice safe location she trillion dollar green news scam to abolish oil coal and natural gas she pledged to ban fracking no fracking or thats going to do well in remember pennsylvania i said it she wants no fracking and shes on tape the beautiful thing about modern technology is when you say something youre screwed if its bad if you say it wrong youre screwed she said i never said about fracking then we play about tapes you know how there will be no fracking there will be we will defund the police she says i have to be very careful when i say that because if i say we will defund the police imitating her theyll put me on television tonight saying donald trump wants to defund the police got to be very careful tom sarcasm doesnt work when you have a crooked press you know when i imitated him because biden and i dont want to waste a lot of time but because its over now right hes gone i told you he would be i told you he wasnt going to make it i told you in the debate and they called for the debate they wanted it early i said okay i accepted every rule everyone said why did you do that i mean you accepted cnn you accepted fake tapper you accepted all of these things why did you do that so i said because its the only way because they thought i wouldnt do it so i said yes and they were shocked but we had the debate right and he kept saying like theyd say kept tapper fake tapper but i have to tell you they were very fair they in my opinion they were very fair you cant ask for i was shocked they they gained a whole level of respect i really mean it cnn and both of them they gained a level of respect right dont you think so i do i told them that i called them both up but i never saw the bed like this so you know we give it a certain period of time and im running i get it talk very fast because this is so many to say my mind is rushing rushing rushing boom and i hit it right on the butt but they kept saying to them so you have seconds left what what you have seconds left and i said ill take it they said no youre not allowed to you have seconds and he was like oh next question so you have seconds remaining what oh so we got off to a good start we got off to this but from the time of the were listening here to former president donald trump speaking in st cloud minnesota we do have to step away for our final commercial break of the hour we head back out to this next that would not have been good but he blew it anyway but he said we put the baby aside if the babys born we put the baby aside and we discuss with the mother whether or not we terminate the babys life this is after this is an abortion this is this is called was called execution kamala pay for abortion for any reason she even voted against legislation that would require medical providers to give care to attempted abortion theyre the radical ones you see the democrats really and not all of them because most of them agree with us theyre the radical ones you see the democrats really and not all of them because most of them agree with us theyre the radical ones whereas our position is that abortion is now back to the states theyve wanted to have this this is been going on for years the way everybody at all legal scholars they always said this is the way it should be everybody wanted it back in the states democrats republicans liberals conservatives and legal scholars every legal scholar wanted it back in the states and then about years ago people started talking about the number of weeks the number of months the number of this that they wanted it back in the states where thats whats happening you look at ohio they decided you look at kansas they decided you look at a lot of different states either side and then sometimes it comes out the way certain people want it sometimes it didnt ohio came out with somewhat of a liberal interpretation and so did kansas which was a little surprising but people like ronald reagan i believe in exceptions for the life of the mother rape and incest and i also believe that you have to follow your heart but you also have to get elected you have to remember that we have to get elected and i want to thank the supreme court justices clarence thomas samuel alito john roberts brett kavanagh neil gorsuch and amy coney barrett for the wisdom and courage they showed on this longterm very contentious issue but getting it back to the states puts the question where it belongs with the vote of the people and its over time and youll see this over time its going to work out incredibly well in a a just an issue that was tearing our country apart for to an end and people are coming together its going to be the vote of the people and its a state vote its the way it was supposed to be it should federal government so thank you i think its i think its so important to say i think its so this november the american people are going to reject kamala harriss crazy liberal extremism on a massive landslide were going to have a landslide because its going to be too big to rig you know what too big to rig is were not going to states into communist san francisco you know years ago san francisco was perhaps the greatest the greatest city in the country and now its unlivable its unlivable the crime is so bad the drugs are so bad she is ruined and she was the original of the bad de she was the original the prosecutors he blew them all away there are a lot of people that say she destroyed san francisco she will destroy our country she will destroy and can maybe live with moderate but we have to bring our country back weve gone down a long way remember this out of the million people and probably much more than many they have to be taken out were going to have the largest deportation effort in the history of our country the criminals we have to get them out immediately every voter in minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and marxists came to burn down minneapolis years ago remember me i couldnt get your governor to act hes supposed to call in guard so i sent in the national guard to save minneapolis well kamala harris sided with the arsonist and ryder and raised money to bail out the criminals bail them all out of jail i kept waiting for his call you remember the guy from cnn the reporter so called i wont use his name but i dont want to embarrass shaved head nice looking he said and he goes this is a friend near city was burning remember it was like a war zone the entire city was burning down and as he was speaking somebody threw like a hand grenade at his feet and friendly friendly rally know you know its a friendly rally this is a friendly rally by the way i feel so bad there are people outside that cannot if you outside all go and vote now look we lose it theres no this lake the other day kamala had people we counted it they said it was and thats okay but they said she had a massive crowd of people it was that it was under a thousand but this they never talk about this they dont take a look camera work it must i know its not a news camera because they dont do that even the ones that are on our side they dont show the crowd size,0.0
heres why i stopped watching the news,sign up to my newsletter here last year i completely stopped watching the news,since i was a little kid ive associated the news on tv with a sinking feeling theres something about it that would scare me not just the terrible things that i was seeing but how there seemed to be a neverending supply of it its like a constant loop of the same four or five stories things really seemed to reach a boiling point for me personally during the presidential elections i was glued to the news trying to understand what was going on im horrified by most of what i saw i was totally sucked in and emotionally invested into a bubble buying into the sensationalized us and international conflicts and over time i started to see the consequences of this i could feel myself growing more resentful and pessimistic and also cynical i was becoming less trustful about people and about the world so i started to wonder what things would be like if i stopped watching the news if i remove this entirely from my life not just a one week or day challenge but a permanent shift away from me no more fox wall street journal or cnn now now i used to think it was my obligation as a citizen to stay informed but my perspective started to shift and thats the reason why i chose to do this first of all stay informed on what when you watch the news youre letting someone else decide whats important and whats worth your attention youre letting them handpick the five or so stories they think you should be aware of out of everything that is going on in the entire world and usually its the most extreme people and the most extreme images to get all the screen time bold red text in all caps breaking news im not advocating for ignorance or denial im just saying that i dont buy into the sensationalization how is the news helping me its a bunch of problems and no solutions you have to pick a political team and everyone else is on the other side it honestly sometimes feels like it doesnt reflect reality when i just watch whats going on im pretty powerless to change things anyway im not saying its not possible im just saying that i think its a better use of my time and energy to focus on myself and what i can contribute to the world on something positive instead of being a keyboard warrior and condemning something i saw online i mean lets face it theres an infinite amount of material available out there to get offended of so last year i started to phase out my exposure to the news i removed all news apps from my phone and also made an effort to remove it from my social media feeds like youtube reddit and instagram i stopped using facebook altogether which meant no more relative sharing a weird combination of political frustrations with cute dog videos being on facebook during an election campaign was like a neverending thanksgiving dinner with a divided family not good and finally whenever i would see the news i would make an effort to change the channel look away exit the app or leave the room i dont need to watch a panel of people twice my age scream at each other about the same thing over and over i find that pretty stressful and unproductive at first i just transitioned to french news and then i realized that it was the same thing just a different president and different language so then i dropped that too the first thing that i realized once i was finally able to detox from the endless stream of news and updates was how unimportant of it is humans did okay for thousands of years without knowing about every disaster every hour i dont think our biological hardware is properly equipped for that deluge of information actually i found that not following the news frees up a lot of time and energy that i can put into other stuff that feels more practical and concrete in my life like this project of me trying to get my life together i feel like my outlook on things has lightened up a little bit too the worlds not ending not yet i see a lot of people trying to figure things out for themselves and its encouraging people are searching im not trying to plug my ears and ignore stuff like climate change im just trying to focus on whats within my power now i still consume economic or international news from time to time that isnt dramatized or hyped up mainly a couple of podcasts that do a great job and ill link to them down below if youre interested but for the most part i dont follow any news i think im doing all right i hear stuff from people but in general it doesnt feel like im living under a rock and im panicking about whats happening out there theres no point and i bet its better for my mental health that way too im curious are any of you doing or trying to do the same thing how do you feel about it this channel this project is all about my search for mental clarity and an alternative way of living in the st century im increasingly seeing it as kind of like a series of experiments a way to sort of just question established norms and not in like a screw the system sort of way but just as a way to take responsibility as an individual and to better my own life you know theres a part of me that is terrified of sleepwalking through life of seeing my opportunities and my time pass me by so im trying to figure out how i can live more presently and just squeeze more of the juice out of life one thing i can say with full certainty is that its not clear its not a clear path its not a linear path and its not necessarily for everybody not everybodys searching is my belief that our minds if they are the most valuable thing that we have access to on this earth that its one of them and so its its very important for all of us to make an effort to take care of it to take care of what goes into our minds and how we treat ourselves and im trying to make the whole experience as cinematic as possible so these videos take a long time and this project is really important to me and im not in it for the money but of course i would love to do this longterm id love to put all of my time into these videos and one way you can help me do that if youre interested is by contributing on my patreon its a fantastic way also to get access to some exclusive content and some behindthescenes content but mainly its a way to help me allocate more of my resources to creating these videos so consider checking it out theres no obligation obviously if money is tight my patreon should not be at the top of your list of things to put money towards alright thank you for watching follow me on social media do all the things it is freezing out here and it is starting to snow i dont know if you can see it so i will see you soon you,0.0

budget highlights impact on stock market ca rachana ranade,in this video we will summarise the complexities of budget discover how the latest financial policies will shape the stock,hey folks ca rachana ranade here and i welcome you all to budget video its going to be a really interesting video were going to divide this video into three parts the first part first part is going to be about taxation so generally our finance minister divides the budget into two parts first one is about economy and second part is about taxation we are going to do it the reverse way first part is going to be about taxation thats what is going to really matter us right second one is about the overall economy and the third one which i am going to add is impact of budget on stock market so its going to be an information packed video so keep on watching the video till the end before i move on one important clarification that this is a shoot and release video so just in case if i fumble upon something please dont forget to check out the pinned comment where i will do the necessary corrections if any right so with that lets understand about the key highlights of the budget but before that let me tell you that today because of the budget we have a separate you know discount which is available on our website so you can use the coupon code budget to avail extra discount on all our stock market related courses be the beginners intermediate or advanced level of courses and this discount coupon code which is budget will be valid only till midnight today so if you want to invest in knowledge this is the right time okay so now lets move on with budget highlights first things first lets understand what were the expectations all around expectations were around rural development they were around unemployment i mean tackling the problems around unemployment the expectations were around tackling inflation around the boost of msmes that is micro small and medium enterprises it was about tax relief for individuals and so many more right so what what was focused on what was not so well just go through and understand one by one so first lets start with the part on taxation okay first and foremost our finance minister uh nirmala sitaraman ji she was very clear in her speech that whatever we are going to give as a benefit that is only going to be for the new tax regime in short old tax regime they may want to fade out in the coming years is what i understand but whatever tax slab changes were done were only for the new tax regime okay so first slab remains unchanged for the second slab to lakhs was taxed at now up to up to lakh rupees will be taxed at the second slab used to be to now the new slab is going to be from to up to to used to be the earlier slab now to lakhs at last two slabs remain the same all in all if you fall into this mid category earning somewhere between lakhs to around lakhs whatever this this whole category lakhs roughly in that case you will have a comparatively lower taxation how much could you save up to you could save up to is what nirmala sitaraman ji told in her budget speech and all in all she said that with this it will encourage higher disposable income for the individuals right second important point which was told was about the standard deduction if you are a salaried employee or earlier standard deduction used to be now the new standard deduction is going to be third very important point is about the family pension for pensioners the deduction for this used to be rupees and that has been taken up to rupees so with this all all these things where you know standard deduction increase or family pension related deductions overall she mentioned that it could bring relief to almost cr salaried individuals and pensioners so all in all very good till now three important points through which our tax outflow will be less number one i talked about the new tax slabs as per the tax regime second i talked about increase in standard deduction third i talked about the family pension thing okay all these three points will reduce our tax outflow dont feel very happy wait points are coming up capital gains shortterm capital gain earlier used to be at now it is going to be taxed at okay so lets assume you are investing in stock markets you bought a you bought a stock lets say one month ago and you selling it this in this month earlier you are required to pay only tax now youll be required to pay tax okay talking about longterm gains on all financial and nonfinancial assets now it is going to attract a tax rate of instead of earlier so lets say you are investing in longterm shares okay you have you have held on to some stocks for more than one year and you sell it after one year earlier tax slab was only tax rate was only now it will be okay but one silver lining to this dark cloud is that earlier you used to get an exemption of up to lakh rupees for longterm capital gains so in simple words whatever longterm capital gain you had up to lakh rupees for that zero tax was the amount but now this has been increased to okay so again a good point now comes a point for futures and options for futures the stt used to be at now stands at so again increase and for options it used to be for stt and now it has been increased to of the option premium so all in all be it futures be it options be it equity tax has been increased okay now lets come to some other points which is about lets say unlisted shares or some lets say unlisted financial assets i should say that and all nonfinancial assets example property article for that so lets take an example of a house right any any individual who is to buy a house for that person to for that house to become a longterm asset he or she used to have to wait for years and after years if the asset was sold if the house was sold then it used to be a longterm capital asset okay or when if it would have been a gain it would have been a longterm capital gain so the holding period minimum holding period was years now this holding period has been reduced to years good absolutely why not in fact one more good point earlier it used to be tax for something like a house property if its a longterm capital gain now it is going to be reduced to what very happy dont be that much happy why indexation benefit now is going to go off no indexation benefit will be provided for house property just before i started the shoot of this video i did receive an article wherein the finance minister has apparently given some clarification about this that some grandfathering concept may apply to properties which have been bought before but just before the shoot that article came in and ive have not read it properly so if some clarification comes up on that more clarifications come up on it i may do a separate youtube short or a separate video on that but how will you get to know about it for that youll have to subscribe to our channel hit the bell icon so that whenever i post a new video youll get notified about that right so all in all for now indexation benefit gone is definitely not a good point okay next one is about tax on buyback now again one point which brings tears why earlier if i used to get any income on buyback of shares that used to be exempt in my hands as an individual but starting st october in the hands of the recipient any income on buyback is going to be taxed okay but at least again silver lining what is that starting from st october means what from april till date or till even th september if any buybacks do come in the stock market you participate in the buyback you get some income that income will be taxfree in your hands but after that after st october youll have to pay tax on that okay one very important point which is about individuals holding assets in foreign lands disclosure about that very very important point just to give you an example a few of my friends also staying in my society for example they are having an employment lets say with microsoft or with google okay usa okay so they get some shares of that company as an esop for that they have to open a demat account there for that also may have to open a bank account there so this is something where a disclosure was originally mandatory today also disclosure is mandatory but wait earlier the position was that assume youre holding shares worth rupees some or whatever okay worth and if you dont give the disclosure penalty amount lakhs up to lakh rupees was the penalty amount so youll be like what if youre holding even up to rupes and penalty will be lakh yes that was the provision now of course it was you know not i mean then there had to be some amendment or there had to be some clarification for this and that came up in the budget wherein it was very clearly mentioned that nonreporting of such financial assets such financial assets means the point that i told you right now wherein you are holding some uh movable assets abroad out of india basically in such cases if they are valued up to lakh rupees then it will not invite any penalty even if you dont give any disclosure so in the same example if my friend is holding shares of microsoft even up to lakh rupees and if that is not disclosed in the income tax return that will not attract the penalty okay i hope this point is clear and with that the taxation part is over second part is about economy till now even if you have not liked the video pause the video smash the like button and then continue with the balance part of the video so nine priorities were discussed one was about agriculture second was about employment third one was about was about human resource development then manufacturing and services urban development energy infra innovation and rd and next gen reforms now if i were to talk about all these and details like madam sitaraman gave a budget speech for almost one one and a half hour i will have to continue for another one one and a half hour if i have to explain all these nine points which im not going to do obviously so what im going to do is just two three points out of these ill explain which may have impact on some stocks okay so lets move on with the rural development point here she mentioned that there is an announcement that a substantial sum of lakh crores will be year marked for development of rural areas which will enhance rural infrastructure so in short trillion rupees have been allocated for what for rural infrastructure okay so immediately you have to think of stocks which can be impacted because of rural infrastructure it could be something like lt it could be something like kr constructions second one overall they want to improve the living conditions and economic opportunities in the rural regions now if this happens if the rural employment increases the rural disposable income will increase and automatically fmcg stocks can have a good impact in fact it is said that fmcg companies get almost of their share of revenue from rural areas more than in fact so that is why for them if rural economy is boosted its definitely going to be a positive point for them so it could be britania nestle something like a hero moto corp itc all this can have a positive impact okay talking about the last one which is about pm aawaas yojanaagain an additional additional what can i say cr houses under pm aawaas yojana were announced both for urban as well as rural that falls under the affordable housing solutions so again with stocks can you think of it could be something like uh hdfc bank it could be something like canin homes it could be lc housing finance all these stocks could have a positive impact because of this right moving on next one is about gold and platinum custom duty now this has been cut gold and silver custom duty has been cut to platinum to obviously with stocks can get positive impact be titan kalyan jwellers senco gold pc dwellers then tribhovandas bhimji all all these can have a positive impact for people like you and me what is the impact that is more important for us if the custom duty is less see majority of the times we as a country we import gold if custom duty is less basic my purchasing price ideally will be less so ideally as individuals we can expect a drop in prices of gold as well as silver okay what about mobile phones custom duty has been reduced for mobile phones for pcb sprinted circuit board assemblies and charges to which stocks can it impact something like dixon kane suber these stocks could get impacted positive or negative negative impact okay so this is about the custom duty part and last and the most important which is impact on stock market now if i were to understand the impact on stock market we have to understand how did the market behaved today okay by the way if you want to learn more about stocks of course as i mentioned i do have courses but i also have memberships wherein i discuss one stock in detail absolute detail every single month and the stock is announced on the first of every month the actual stock is released on the th this is not a stock tip or something like that i teach how to analyze stocks from different different sectors be it oil and gas be it infra be it aviation so there are different different ratios which you need to understand from each and every sector so you can consider smashing the join button on youtube so that you can get access to these videos as well so going on to the final part impact on stock market so lets understand how did the market behave post budget in this is what the candle looked like in huge red candle second day what happened gap down and again a huge red candle okay so two days back toback huge red candles kind of a recovery and after that zap it fell down okay slowly and steadily it started to go up and by november again the same level was attained so even though we saw a sharp correction july august september october november within next five months markets almost hit those same levels and post that in fact it went higher okay then could we see something like a so here there was a correction of almost now could we see a correction of no one can tell exact or not it may not even fall half of this also so first we have to understand how did the candle of i mean how how todays candle looked like so for that lets check this is how it looked like was there a sharp fall today yes sharp fall came when futures and options k when ltcg stcg all points when they came in back to back market actually went into a free fall but slowly steadily market started market started to you know digest all these news and it actually recovered very nicely to close at this so this is not at all a bad candle so ideally if you ask me we should not see such a sharp correction something like but what is the underlying point see if you a longterm investor in that case you have to understand that any such corrections are going to be eventually recovered be its just a matter of time be months months four months months whatever but what we have seen in the past the markets have recovered so if you are a longterm investor ideally you should take these opportunities as buy on dips categories and you should in fact build your portfolio as a stronger portfolio so that you can get a positive impact in the longer term right i hope you have enjoyed this nice shoot and release video somewhere around minutes ideally but if you feel that uh you know if you want to add something to whatever i have mentioned in todays video because i cannot of course tell of the story i try to crunch it down to minutes story if you feel that there are some more important points that everyone else should know please let your let me know your thoughts in the comment section below and what like share subscribe that is that is for sure dont forget to check out the pinned comment as well i hope you enjoyed this one till then take care jai hind and byebye,0.0

why are news headlines so negative,ever notice how negative news headlines can be breaking the news host danielle bainbridge explains why this is done on,why do people click more on negative headlines than positive ones well according to one study of online media behavior negative words in a headline increase clickthrough rate by per word whereas positive words actually decrease the clickthrough rate remember when alaska airlines had an emergency landing because a panel fell off one of the sides of its planes announcer a missing door plug from the alaska airlines flight has been recovered well depending on which headline you read you may have gotten very different parts of the story and some of the headlines even made the incident seem more tragic and fatal than it actually was its important to note that fortunately nobody died during this incident but according to some of these headlines you may not know that unless you read the story and journalists know this all this to say headlines are important but theyre designed to pack a punch often leaning towards negativity so be sure to read the entire article to get the full story when youre consuming news,0.0
negative messages and bad newswriting notes,in this writing notes video i discuss how to write business messages delivering bad news which is a lot trickier than delivering,hello so in this episode of writing notes were going to talk about conveying negative messages or delivering bad news which is tricky to do well to say the least its substantially harder than delivering routine or positive messages so were going to learn a couple of strategies for navigating delivering bad news and in particular were going to learn to structure a written message conveying bad news so when you are delivering bad news theres a the set of things that you want to want to try and achieve theres five basic goals so the first is to clearly convey the bad news this should be pretty straightforward if you watched my video on key principles of business writing we know that clarity and being direct are always important in business writing the second is to persuade the reader to accept the bad news so what does that mean well that means that you need to convince the reader or you need to present the information in such a way that the reader will accept it even though theyre not likely to be happy about it so thats a challenging thing because when we get bad news were often reluctant to embrace it the third thing that you want to do is to retain as much goodwill as possible so you want to try and cushion the blow you want to try and keep the reader on side as much as possibleand ill suggest some strategies for doing that in a little bit fourth is related you want to preserve or repair your reputation that may be your personal reputation the companys reputation the organizations reputation whatever it is you want to try and keep the reader again keep the reader on side you want to if possible convince them to continue working with you in the future things like that and then the fifth is that you want to preempt the need for further communication so we saw this as well with the video on routine and positive messages you want to try and answer all of the possible questions provide all of the necessary details etc etc so that they dont have to respond to you and the whole communication doesnt need to be dragged out any more than is absolutely necessary so those are your five main goals when delivering bad news to clearly convey the bad news to persuade the reader to accept it to retain as much goodwill as possible to preserve or repair your reputation and to preempt the need for further communication now how you do that is through an indirect rhetorical strategy ive done a video on direct versus indirect rhetoric for negative messages you want to use indirect rhetoric because thats going to be less overt less confrontational about the bad news so to structure this message youre basically looking at a four stage process the first is you want to set up a buffer then you want to provide reasons or explanation for the situation then you want to clearly and directly state the bad newsand concisely state the bad newsand then you want a closing so ill talk through each of these a little bit more starting with the buffer this is a very important part of delivering bad news because this is a bit at the beginning of the message in which you give the reader something neutral or even positive so you dont start with the bad news sometimes it is important to use a direct approach but generally speaking use the indirect approach start with something thats neutral or positiveyou may tell the reader about some sort of recent success you may talk about something else thats going on with the company or the organization you may have a more sort of personal thing but you want to start with this buffer because this is going to shield the reader and put them into at least a neutral if not a positive frame of mind starting from the beginning now one potential pitfall with the buffer is you dont want this to be sort of over the top joyous because you dont want to like lift your reader way way up only to then say actually heres some bad news so youre really shooting for sort of neutral to moderate positive so you want something like lets say you are refusing to refund someones money for a customized garment for instance you might start by like thanking them for their business and saying its really wonderful to have customers who appreciate fine quality merchandise or something like this you might talk about something like that as a way of saying we appreciate you so this is positive without being necessarily like fireworks going off kind of positive so once youve done that once youve given us a buffer thats gonna sort of cushion this blow the next thing that you want in this message is an explanation for the situation an explanation for the negative whatever it is so heres where you would provide reasons youd provide justifications youd provide explanation you provide details you provide data about whatever it is about whatever the situation is that has led to this bad news so if you were denying or if you werent able to offer holiday bonuses for instance to the people in your company you might talk about the drop in sales in this fiscal year or something like this or you might talk about the in this case maybe the hardships brought on by the pandemic and how thats thats caused a drop in company financing things like this so you want to say heres all heres the information that led to this decision whatever this negative decision is whatever this bad news is here is what you need to know in order to understand why this situation exists then stage three you want to clearly concisely and directly state the bad news whatever that negative message is you want to put it right there after those reasons so that theres a clear link say between heres whats going on here is the decision heres the bad news and you want this to be concise im going to emphasize that because the more time you spend dwelling on the bad news the more times you repeat it the more times you focus on it the more thats going to be the thing that the reader really takes away so dont be dishonest about this you want this to be clear and direct but you also want the bad news to be surrounded by a sort of cushion of neutralmoderately positive and explanation so the thinner that layer of bad news can be the less impactful thats going to be compared to the other stuff in the message and then the fourth step of this is a closing and you want to you want to try and do something again positive or neutral if you can get more positive in the closing thats generally a good thingif you can offer some sort of say special discount or if you can provide some sort of alternative solution to the problem if you can basically give the the reader something positive that youre closing on then thats a good way to try and achieve some of those goals particularly the goals of maintaining good will and repairing your reputation so if you can again if you can end on a positive note end on a high note thats more likely to maintain the readers goodwill and thats super super important when youre delivering bad news so thats the structure that you want to use for most messages where youre delivering bad news the buffer the reasons and justification concise statement of the bad news and then a closing now theres a couple of other things to think about when delivering bad news one of them is never ever ever ever ever blame the reader for the situation even if it is their fault if you blame the reader if you say well this is your fault because you didnt fill out your form correctly were not refunding your money because you bought the wrong size like an idiot or whatever it is no never ever ever ever do that that is one of the best ways to lose the good will and to compromise your reputation your organizations reputation etc etc so absolutely dont blame them another tip if you can deliver bad news in person which is a lot less comfortable for many people but thats often seen as more genuine so thats actually a really good strategy so if you can contact that person and say look you and i face to face ive got some bad newsuse the buffer and explanation and stuff like that before you actually get to the bad news but if you can do it in person then thats often going to be seen as more genuine than if youre writing a message though often writing a message is a necessary way of doing it particularly when youre communicating with large groups of people and things like this you may need to write a memo or an email or something like this send the bad news as quickly as possible dont sit on it dont wait for it because the longer people go without having bad news given to them the worse the impact is going to be so the sooner you can send that message out the sooner you can make sure that your readers have got that the better and then the last one ill talk about this periodically throughout my videos especially about business writing proofread proofread proofread especially with a negative message make sure that it is as grammatically and mechanically correct as you can possibly make it especially with bad news grammar and mechanics errors word choice errors any sort of mistake like that is going to seem like carelessness and its going to be amplified well beyond the actual significance of that error so you want to make sure that it is grammatically and mechanically perfect so thats the key things to keep in mind when youre delivering bad news when youre writing negative messages keep in mind the goals and let those shape the way you approach your reader keep in mind the structure and then make sure that you are using these various strategies to anticipate your audiences needs,0.0

facing charges for fentanyl trafficking money laundering firearms offenses kidnaping and conspiracy to commit murder guzman lopez is said to have been promoted to a leadership role along with his

weather rain continues in the south dry and sunny in the northeast and finally a special find during a walk on the beach a message in a bottle dating back nearly years so cool trish hartman our philadelphia station has the story there was right there on the beach amy smyth murphy was walking on the beach at corsons inlet state park in ocean city when she saw something unusual i noticed it because the bottle is like a really nice aqua it was early in the morning on july third and she says the glass bottle corked with something inside was right there on the sand she couldnt wait to tell her year old nephew jack we made a group chat everyone was like decoding it looking things up once amy figured out that she wanted to open up the bottle and try and figure out where it came from she knew she wanted to document the process and since she had teenagers handy they got to help her put all the videos on tiktok from the uncorking process which released a stench no one expected to the painstaking removal of the note inside moving to the research that followed i joined a reddit group about bottles leading amy to believe the bottle is from the short note mentioning a yacht based in atlantic city called the neptune along with a business card yacht neptune is a pleasure yacht owned and operated by captain sam steve nagy of stockton university has spent decades diving to local shipwrecks and written books about underwater archeology he says its possible recent beach replenishment kicked the bottle up to shore getting bottles is always a treasured find and its not that hard to do that based on amys research she thinks it could be the oldest message in a bottle ever found shes reached out to the guinness book of world records and is waiting to hear back the only reason i can do this is because of all the technology that we have reporting in ocean city new jersey trish hartman channel seven eyewitness news of year old message that is pretty cool it is incredible you know what i want to find in a bottle some cash so lets make that a thing me too well thats whats making news in america this morning have a great weekend thank you for tuning in its friday july th shes polling better than biden but thats not nearly good enough we start here vice president kamala harris tries to chart a new path to election if her first campaign stop is any indication its going to be the exact same map as biden but first she has to shore up the democratic base what new polling says about her strengths and weaknesses a wildfire explodes in northern california all of a sudden there was a major shift in the wind here and this fire just spotted right up what we know about the damage and the suspected arsonist behind it and a chinese spy balloon is one thing but what are chinese bombers doing off alaska kind of the equivalent of an aerial pinger to the us the us scrambled jets to escort them away for what might not be the last time from abc news this is start here im brad mielke this week began with president biden making a historic announcement that he would not be seeking reelection this week ends with his vice president kamala harris in full presidential campaign mode we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought hard won freedoms and rights on wednesday harris was in indianapolis holding a social justice town hall yesterday spoke to thousands of teachers at an afp union event in houston before meeting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu back in dc we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies we allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and i will not be silent you can almost see what her team is thinking right now right focus your efforts on the upper midwest get unions behind you rally black voters and other groups that youll need to win a national election and do it fast in the last few days the harris campaign says they have signed up more than new volunteers they scheduled more than local events in battleground states however former president trump clearly has a plan here as well if you dont mind im not going to be nice is that okay since the debate youve seen him on the stump almost workshop ing new lines of attack against his new potential opponent the voters are the voters when you look at how bad they are you say you know i like trump but now i really like trump some are rooted in the policies of the bidenharris administration others seem rooted in sexism or racism mocking harris voice intentionally her name which has really become a thing throughout the republican party kamala i call it laughing kamala you ever you laugh crazy you know you can tell a lot by a laugh that shes crazy shes nuts each candidate is racing to define kamala harris to the masses well we started getting a sense of how the masses are responding back so lets start the day with galen druke from our partners at fivethirtyeight he hopes the fivethirtyeight politics podcast weve actually seen a flurry of polls now coming out over the last hours with kamala harris his name at the top of the ticket right so what are we learning from them the top line news is that on average donald trump leads kamala harris about a percentage point nationally that is a bit better than biden was doing against trump towards the end of the push for him to drop out of the race according to fivethirtyeights average it was paused when trump was leading biden by about three and a half percentage points so thats an improvement nationally but i want to caution here that so much news has happened over the past week and a half that we should probably be waiting i dont know until the end of next week or maybe even a little bit longer before we try to get a sense of where is the resting point of the race is going to be according to the polls but we can say a couple of things about the fundamentals before we get into the nitty gritty which is one i found this poll from you got to be really helpful in understanding the race and it essentially asked americans do you see biden or trump fit for a second term of americans said no to trump and no to biden and for those folks they asked why not for trump the answer was that they saw him as corrupt and dangerous and for biden it was that they saw him as too old and incompetent the biden side of the equation has been removed kamala harris is age is not going to be an issue in this campaign maybe apart from the fact that shes about years younger than trump but thats perceptions of the candidates when it comes to the issues things have probably not changed all that much according to new polling out from blueprint voters see harris and biden as basically just as liberal on all of the issues and you may be thinking oh maybe that redounds to harris benefit because biden was seen as kind of moderate but not actually over the three and a half years that biden was president he came to be seen as very liberal in fact more liberal than the majority of americans issues like inflation the economy immigration crime and safety and the like and so that is was a vulnerability for biden and its going to continue to be a vulnerability for harris now i think the harris campaign is going to try to moderate a bit particularly from the policy positions that she laid out during the democratic primary which were even to the left of biden things like decriminalizing crossing the border getting rid of private health insurance and the like so well see if shes able to beat republicans to the punch and try to reshape how voters view her on the issues or if republicans are able to define her first hey if were seeing this like slight improve in the polls with harris who are those voters like are there certain groups of people that are actually finding their way into the harris camp are we able to deduce that at all yeah and its a pretty simple answer actually its the parts of the electorate that you would naturally assume would go more democratic but were not so hot on biden so its for example young voters voters of color women to some extent we trust women to make decisions about own party i mean young voters is a really good example biden won them by about percentage points in but was down to a single digit lead with young voters in the polls he dropped out now harris is back up to about a point lead with young voters so getting democrats back where they were before she also has potential new vulnerability with the kinds of voters that biden maybe overperformed with a little compared to where democrats had historically been and thats largely white voters how much capitalism if you want to be able to make a million bucks fine thats okay but just make sure you pay your fair share in taxes yeah he did significantly better than democrats usually do with white voters with a college degree in that has held up pretty well i dont think theres any reason to think that harris wont hold up pretty well with those voters either the reality is that biden didnt improve that much on how hillary clinton had done amongst white working class voters you know clinton lost them by percentage points biden only lost them by percentage points but harris is going to have to watch out for is stemming the losses for democrats there because thats a group of voters that is very overrepresented in the northern battleground states like wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania and so if her support erodes even a little bit more amongst those voters it could put the electoral college a little bit further out of reach the the electorates that she the parts of the electorate that she does quite well with are overrepresented in the southern battleground states like nevada arizona georgia north carolina so harris for her part doesnt want to be caught in a situation where she does a bit better in the southern battleground states but not better enough to actually win them while doing worse in the northern states and putting them out of reach so shes really still going to in many ways try to pursue the same campaign strategy that the biden campaign was pursuing that thats what i was trying to get at is because youre saying like she actually might have a bit more of an advantage in a place like georgia or north carolina people you know places where there are more say black voters or you know young voters whatever it is she might have a bit more of an advantage there does that mean that her map her electoral chances are different than bidens were or does she have to win the exact same states theyre going to send to the exact same places that they would have sent biden if her first campaign stop is any indication its going to be the exact same map as biden good afternoon wisconsin wisconsin was the tipping point state for trump in and it was the tipping point state for biden in which is to say that the state that put them over the edge in the electoral college and look trump also knows that these are the states where the bid for the electoral college is going to play out were going to drill baby drill were going to shut down border were going to put americas citizens first in some ways the choice of jd vance as a running mate was a doubling down on his appeal to white voters without a college degree thats the kind of voter that trump overperformed with in that handed him the electoral college i will eliminate on tips for restaurant workers hospitality workers and so while it is true you know the south is full of states that do have younger voters and more diverse electorates but because democrats have been running so far behind in the southern battleground states down by more like seven plus points in places like nevada arizona georgia and north carolina i think that they still imagine those northern battleground states to be more within reach and so far weve seen you know in the limited really limited state polling thats been out there that shes still polling pretty close to where biden was in a place like pennsylvania so i think in some ways she expands the map a little bit if democrats do really well theres probably a better chance that harris picks up some of those states that biden flipped in but at the end of the day i dont think youre going to see any less attention paid to wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania its almost like youre talking about the two belts right yet the rust belt i think youll definitely need to win that but you also had the sun belt which now you know these states from the southeast to the southwest maybe those look more interesting or more competitive than they did a few months ago the other thing i keep going back to here is if harris in this new york times siena poll that just came out yesterday harris has climbed back to a one point deficit in the popular vote and im like excuse me if if a democrat loses the popular vote by isnt that an electoral college wipe out like everything i know about modern politics me republicans can win with a minority of voters but democrats certainly can yeah i mean for some context biden won the national popular vote by about four and a half percentage points but he barely eked it out in the battleground states and of course thats what matters in this game of winning the electoral college we have to slow our role here because we really dont know how this is all going to end up for example trump could still be experiencing a convention bounce or you know an increase in his approval rating based on an assassination attempt against him just a week and a half ago im not supposed to be here tonight not supposed to be here americans are reacting to so much because to your point in that new york times siena college polling they recorded the highest approval rating ever for former president trump so people are viewing trump in a kinder light in this very moment but will that persist i have no idea also harris may be experiencing a honeymoon moment because theres just been so much positive press about the enthusing of the fundraising etc and by the same point republicans havent really had a chance to define her yet so i think we really have to be careful about assuming that the polls today will the polls tomorrow or even you know a month from now but if harris does lose the national popular vote by a percentage point yes i think theres almost no circumstance in which democrats have an electoral college advantage that results in then winning the electoral college despite losing the national popular vote so she has to basically keep improving on whatever gains shes seeing right now really interesting a galen druke from fivethirtyeight and of course the fivethirtyeight politics podcast which you should all be listening to thank you so much caitlin thank you act upon start here those who avoided the deadliest wildfire in californias history are seeing another one roar into town well take you to the fire line after the break abc news live honored with eight emmy nominations more than any other streaming news network and abc news live prime with linsey davis the first and only streaming show nominated for best outstanding live news program thank you for making abc news live americas number one streaming is another historic week and now kamala harris hits the campaign trail who will be her running mate and how will the trump campaign take her on sunday morning on abcs this week there have been several huge wildfires in california in recent years but among the most horrifying has to be the one that basically wiped out the town of paradise california its so hard for people to understand why they cant go back to their homes the entire community of paradise is a toxic wasteland remember this fire killed dozens of people in it destroyed entire neighborhoods part of what made it so deadly was the geography itself paradise was only accessible by one major road i called my husband i just said i i dont think im going to make it out of this its coming in too fast this fire got so big and fast people couldnt escape well on wednesday another fire began in northern california near the city of chico and quickly exploded in size it is currently the largest fire the state has seen this year and some of the flames are less than ten miles from the town of paradise lets go to abcs kenneth roth who spent all day yesterday there on the fire line anna what have you been seeing yeah hey brad i mean you can actually see the plume of smoke from sacramento right i mean that is almost hours away and when you were talking about paradise you know i want to tell you i reached out immediately to the football coach at paradise high school who i met after the fire there and you know because he popped in my mind right away there was so much trauma because of that fire for people that live in this area and he said they were really on edge they were waiting for the wind to shift they were concerned and so that trauma rings deep throughout this neighborhood and so to stand there and you get yourself to chico and you can see this massive plume of smoke in the horizon its a really scary deal brad and theres so many similarities here when you talk about that one road i just drove up and down it same thing its a two lane road the only way in the only way out in fact the fire started so quickly that in the middle of the night they started opening up logging roads to help get people out because it was moving so fast im completely surrounded right now so im going to im actually going to bone out of here and see if i can get ahead of this thing because im going to im going to end up getting caught overnight it burned for acres an hour wow right so its scorched acres in the first hours i mean that kind of speed is astonishing especially brad when were not talking about a santa ana wind event here and there are big forests in this part of the state right so so tons of vegetation burning are people okay are structures i mean how threatening has this been yes so you are right to say that is burning in a lot of forest land some of this land you know hasnt burned in but definitely people are being impacted here too entire communities that are under evacuation orders the communities have cohasset and forest ranch both of those are areas that have not seen a lot of fire in recent history people had to be evacuated again many of them leaving in the middle of the night jumping in their car finding themselves in bumper to bumper traffic with nowhere to go weve got approximately vehicles that are sheltering at the radio towers cohasset road there have been homes damaged and destroyed and really were so early on in this that theyre out assessing that right now that number could grow and change in fact we yesterday were up on a ridge and we watched the fire just come right down all of a sudden there was a major shift in the wind here and this just spotted right up its been burning down this ridge here and that one big gust ignited this whole area i mean it is so close to homes and communities it is very scary how did it start yes so that has people enraged right brad because we know we are in a high fire danger situation here theres red flag warnings now high heat and someone has been arrested for arson in this fire brad a year old man they think that he pushed a car sort of into a ravine that was on fire and it just ignited this thing i mean peoples lives will be changed forever because of that and then to add insult to injury on that one brad authorities think that this yearold started the fire and then essentially made this attempt to blend in with those who were evacuating their homes leaving all of their belongings behind because of him wow and again you think about this community right this part of california and how everyone would have been in such a panic to get out quickly you dont realize you might be running alongside the arsonist who started it kayna whitworth there on the fire lines safe thank you so much yeah of course thanks brad a couple of nights ago american fighter jets intercepted a couple of bombers off the coast of alaska and this sort of thing happens sometimes between the us and russia not quite a midair dogfight more like probing the edges of each others airspace they let us know theyre poking around we let them know were watching but what alarmed american officials here was these werent just russian planes they were russian and chinese and they were together lets go to abcs chief global affairs correspondent martha raddatz martha this looked like a very coordinated not an attack but like a coordinated drill near american airspace like what happened here one word brad it provocative what the chinese and the russians were doing was kind of the equivalent of an aerial finger to the us never before has not only the chinese sent strategic bombers off the coast of alaska but certainly not joint exercises together we should say right away these were unarmed strategic bombers the two chinese two russians but they were nuclear capable strategic bombers so the message was very clear were you should be scared of us and look were doing it together what is the response from the us military in a scenario like that because i imagine you see them coming these are not like stealth bombers like they can see them but you dont know theyre unarmed right so do you arm your jets do you treat them like like they could be dropping nukes on us how does the us respond you know the us military reaction is kind of the equivalent of what russia and china did they they are not about to shoot them down they dont think theyre their armed the bombers but by the way the fighter jets that we scrambled in canada scrambled are armed and they are armed because they are theyre defending the united states if there is a there is a challenge or a threat to the united states of america your troops will be at the ready and they will do the right thing and by the way they knew the us the pentagon from the very beginning of the launch that russia and china were doing this this was not a surprise to us we closely monitored these aircraft tracked the aircraft and when they got within about miles of the coast of the us up by alaska that is when the fighter jets launched now by the way china and russia were not trying to keep this secret they wanted everybody to know were doing this they released video showing the bombers taking off yeah yeah showing the bombers taking off in the darkness its all very dramatic video you see these bombers taking you see aerial refueling image released by the russian ministry of defense and you see the cockpit view from one of the russian bombers of the us fighter jets and canadian jets coming up and essentially surrounding the bombers they they follow them for about an before the bombers exit at this point what is the military relationship like between the russians and the chinese even even beyond the pacific martha well were getting closer all the time and that is really whats behind this look you know were strong and mighty militaries but it is not just the pacific it is it is ukraine it is wherever china and russia can join forces and send that message now were joining forces and trying to make the us look as weak as possible they didnt really look very weak in this in this thing with the fighter jets going up there but its just that message where together look out and to hear this its so weird that there is a kind choreography here that individual countries are used to kind of doing with each other but now to have multiple countries kind of doing these rounds around american airspace really bizarre martha raddatz thank you so much you bet brad okay one more quick break when we come back what would southwest airlines be without chaotic boarding process were about to find out one last thing is next and a great morning morning america morning america good morning america good morning america and im jaclyn lee here in arizona the frontlines of the abortion battle wherever the story is well take you there youre streaming abc news live and one last thing how seriously do you take picking out a seat im not afraid of throwing some elbows brad that is abcs clara mcmichael who covers air travel and the eyes of anyone who travels for a living you can divide air carriers into two groups southwest airlines and everyone sometimes my friend will get called first and she can save my seat so you know i like you when you first come first serve the theater slowly im upset im stressed im tired and i hate the last years southwest is very intentionally not assigned seats when you buy your tickets you pay your fare you show up you might get a boarding group but once youre on that plane you select whatever you want that happens to be empty the company really prides itself this egalitarian approach no first class everybody got the same snacks and apparently at one point the flight attendants would tell the passengers you can sit anywhere you want just like at church now to some this is a positive studies have even shown that open seating leads to faster departures which southwest says leads to cheaper flights but the other customers southwest flights are like an anxiety factory what if you got a big family and there arent enough seats to put you all together what if you hate a middle seat so much you would gladly pay to get out of one well yesterday in a historic decision the company decided to finally join the crowd so theyre going to switch to assign seats and a majority of their customers and potential customers as it turns out and this research theyve been doing they prefer seats and they also found that when a customer quote unquote defects to another airline this open seating policy is the number one reason why now they havent said when theyre going to do this but the immediate reaction from some southwest loyalists was one of betrayal this was known to some as the peoples airline no baggage fees no first class were all in this together could this be the beginning of the end so southwest really says this is all about these changing customer needs but no doubt money is is also a part of this and they want to bring in more revenue southwest said on their earnings call that the extra products they offer right now like early bird boarding those generate around these new offerings they said that theyre going to be substantially north of that now southwest is emphatic that it has no plans to alter its other policies like free checked luggage but think about how one thing can lead to another right airlines figured out a while that if people care enough to reserve their seats they also care enough to pay more aisle seats or extra legroom jetblue was known as a budget airline no first class until it did finally start offering mint seats up front that seem suspiciously familiar regardless youve ever lined up to run on board and snatched your seat feeling like a bend the ball about to hit the streets of pamplona those days might be over but you might long for the days where friends fly and the airline actually felt like a friend okay thatll do it for us but i guess in the last couple of weekends a former president has survived a shooting a current president has ended his campaign im going to stay close to my phone for the next couple days but i hope you get out and you have a great weekend start here is produced by

breaking news out of texas two leaders of a notorious mexican drug cartel now behind bars here in the us yeah they are identified as a drug kingpin known as el mayo and one of el chapos sons accused of sending deadly fentanyl across the us this morning attorney general merrick garland says two leaders of one of the most powerful mexican drug cartels are now in custody officials say year old ismael zambada garcia also known as el mayo and joaquin guzman lopez son of infamous drug lord el chapo were arrested after landing in a private plane in el paso texas yesterday the two men are known to be two of the top leaders of mexicos sinaloa cartel a violent drug trafficking organization known to be one of the main exporters of cocaine and fentanyl to the united states el mayo cofounded the cartel with el chapo and has evaded arrest for decades despite the million bounty on him he is facing charges for fentanyl trafficking money laundering firearms offenses kidnaping and conspiracy to commit murder guzman lopez is said to have been promoted to a leadership role along with his brothers after the extradition of their father el chapo to the us back in fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced the justice department will not rest until every single cartel leader member and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable garland says both men will appear in federal court in the coming day experts say it is unlikely the arrests would have a major impact on the smuggling of fentanyl or other drugs from mexico as the cartel is

warmer weather rain continues in the south dry and sunny in the northeast and finally a special find during a walk on the beach a message in a bottle dating back nearly years so cool trish hartman our philadelphia station has the story there was right there on the beach amy smyth murphy was walking on the beach at corsons inlet state park in ocean city when she saw something unusual i noticed it because the bottle is like a really nice aqua it was early in the morning on july third and she says the glass bottle corked with something inside was right there on the sand she couldnt wait to tell her year old nephew jack we made a group chat everyone was like decoding it looking things up once amy figured out that she wanted to open up the bottle and try and figure out where it came from she knew she wanted to document the process and since she had teenagers handy they got to help her put all the videos on tiktok from the uncorking process which released a stench no one expected to the painstaking removal of the note inside moving to the research that followed i joined a reddit group about bottles leading amy to believe the bottle is from the short note mentioning a yacht based in atlantic city called the neptune along with a business card yacht neptune is a pleasure yacht owned and operated by captain sam steve nagy of stockton university has spent decades diving to local shipwrecks and written books about underwater archeology he says its possible recent beach replenishment kicked the bottle up to shore getting bottles is always a treasured find and its not that hard to do that based on amys research she thinks it could be the oldest message in a bottle ever found shes reached out to the guinness book of world records and is waiting to hear back the only reason i can do this is because of all the technology that we have reporting in ocean city new jersey trish hartman channel seven eyewitness news of year old message that is pretty cool it is incredible you know what i want to find in a bottle some cash so lets make that a thing me too well thats whats making news in america this morning have a great weekend thank you for tuning in its friday july th shes polling better than biden but thats not nearly good enough we start here vice president kamala harris tries to chart a new path to election if her first campaign stop is any indication its going to be the exact same map as biden but first she has to shore up the democratic base what new polling says about her strengths and weaknesses a wildfire explodes in northern california all of a sudden there was a major shift in the wind here and this fire just spotted right up what we know about the damage and the suspected arsonist behind it and a chinese spy balloon is one thing but what are chinese bombers doing off alaska kind of the equivalent of an aerial pinger to the us the us scrambled jets to escort them away for what might not be the last time from abc news this is start here im brad mielke this week began with president biden making a historic announcement that he would not be seeking reelection this week ends with his vice president kamala harris in full presidential campaign mode we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought hard won freedoms and rights on wednesday harris was in indianapolis holding a social justice town hall yesterday spoke to thousands of teachers at an afp union event in houston before meeting israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu back in dc we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies we allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and i will not be silent you can almost see what her team is thinking right now right focus your efforts on the upper midwest get unions behind you rally black voters and other groups that youll need to win a national election and do it fast in the last few days the harris campaign says they have signed up more than new volunteers they scheduled more than local events in battleground states however former president trump clearly has a plan here as well if you dont mind im not going to be nice is that okay since the debate youve seen him on the stump almost workshop ing new lines of attack against his new potential opponent the voters are the voters when you look at how bad they are you say you know i like trump but now i really like trump some are rooted in the policies of the bidenharris administration others seem rooted in sexism or racism mocking harris voice intentionally her name which has really become a thing throughout the republican party kamala i call it laughing kamala you ever you laugh crazy you know you can tell a lot by a laugh that shes crazy shes nuts each candidate is racing to define kamala harris to the masses well we started getting a sense of how the masses are responding back so lets start the day with galen druke from our partners at fivethirtyeight he hopes the fivethirtyeight politics podcast weve actually seen a flurry of polls now coming out over the last hours with kamala harris his name at the top of the ticket right so what are we learning from them the top line news is that on average donald trump leads kamala harris about a percentage point nationally that is a bit better than biden was doing against trump towards the end of the push for him to drop out of the race according to fivethirtyeights average it was paused when trump was leading biden by about three and a half percentage points so thats an improvement nationally but i want to caution here that so much news has happened over the past week and a half that we should probably be waiting i dont know until the end of next week or maybe even a little bit longer before we try to get a sense of where is the resting point of the race is going to be according to the polls but we can say a couple of things about the fundamentals before we get into the nitty gritty which is one i found this poll from you got to be really helpful in understanding the race and it essentially asked americans do you see biden or trump fit for a second term of americans said no to trump and no to biden and for those folks they asked why not for trump the answer was that they saw him as corrupt and dangerous and for biden it was that they saw him as too old and incompetent the biden side of the equation has been removed kamala harris is age is not going to be an issue in this campaign maybe apart from the fact that shes about years younger than trump but thats perceptions of the candidates when it comes to the issues things have probably not changed all that much according to new polling out from blueprint voters see harris and biden as basically just as liberal on all of the issues and you may be thinking oh maybe that redounds to harris benefit because biden was seen as kind of moderate but not actually over the three and a half years that biden was president he came to be seen as very liberal in fact more liberal than the majority of americans issues like inflation the economy immigration crime and safety and the like and so that is was a vulnerability for biden and its going to continue to be a vulnerability for harris now i think the harris campaign is going to try to moderate a bit particularly from the policy positions that she laid out during the democratic primary which were even to the left of biden things like decriminalizing crossing the border getting rid of private health insurance and the like so well see if shes able to beat republicans to the punch and try to reshape how voters view her on the issues or if republicans are able to define her first hey if were seeing this like slight improve in the polls with harris who are those voters like are there certain groups of people that are actually finding their way into the harris camp are we able to deduce that at all yeah and its a pretty simple answer actually its the parts of the electorate that you would naturally assume would go more democratic but were not so hot on biden so its for example young voters voters of color women to some extent we trust women to make decisions about own party i mean young voters is a really good example biden won them by about percentage points in but was down to a single digit lead with young voters in the polls he dropped out now harris is back up to about a point lead with young voters so getting democrats back where they were before she also has potential new vulnerability with the kinds of voters that biden maybe overperformed with a little compared to where democrats had historically been and thats largely white voters how much capitalism if you want to be able to make a million bucks fine thats okay but just make sure you pay your fair share in taxes yeah he did significantly better than democrats usually do with white voters with a college degree in that has held up pretty well i dont think theres any reason to think that harris wont hold up pretty well with those voters either the reality is that biden didnt improve that much on how hillary clinton had done amongst white working class voters you know clinton lost them by percentage points biden only lost them by percentage points but harris is going to have to watch out for is stemming the losses for democrats there because thats a group of voters that is very overrepresented in the northern battleground states like wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania and so if her support erodes even a little bit more amongst those voters it could put the electoral college a little bit further out of reach the the electorates that she the parts of the electorate that she does quite well with are overrepresented in the southern battleground states like nevada arizona georgia north carolina so harris for her part doesnt want to be caught in a situation where she does a bit better in the southern battleground states but not better enough to actually win them while doing worse in the northern states and putting them out of reach so shes really still going to in many ways try to pursue the same campaign strategy that the biden campaign was pursuing that thats what i was trying to get at is because youre saying like she actually might have a bit more of an advantage in a place like georgia or north carolina people you know places where there are more say black voters or you know young voters whatever it is she might have a bit more of an advantage there does that mean that her map her electoral chances are different than bidens were or does she have to win the exact same states theyre going to send to the exact same places that they would have sent biden if her first campaign stop is any indication its going to be the exact same map as biden good afternoon wisconsin wisconsin was the tipping point state for trump in and it was the tipping point state for biden in which is to say that the state that put them over the edge in the electoral college and look trump also knows that these are the states where the bid for the electoral college is going to play out were going to drill baby drill were going to shut down border were going to put americas citizens first in some ways the choice of jd vance as a running mate was a doubling down on his appeal to white voters without a college degree thats the kind of voter that trump overperformed with in that handed him the electoral college i will eliminate on tips for restaurant workers hospitality workers and so while it is true you know the south is full of states that do have younger voters and more diverse electorates but because democrats have been running so far behind in the southern battleground states down by more like seven plus points in places like nevada arizona georgia and north carolina i think that they still imagine those northern battleground states to be more within reach and so far weve seen you know in the limited really limited state polling thats been out there that shes still polling pretty close to where biden was in a place like pennsylvania so i think in some ways she expands the map a little bit if democrats do really well theres probably a better chance that harris picks up some of those states that biden flipped in but at the end of the day i dont think youre going to see any less attention paid to wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania its almost like youre talking about the two belts right yet the rust belt i think youll definitely need to win that but you also had the sun belt which now you know these states from the southeast to the southwest maybe those look more interesting or more competitive than they did a few months ago the other thing i keep going back to here is if harris in this new york times siena poll that just came out yesterday harris has climbed back to a one point deficit in the popular vote and im like excuse me if if a democrat loses the popular vote by isnt that an electoral college wipe out like everything i know about modern politics me republicans can win with a minority of voters but democrats certainly can yeah i mean for some context biden won the national popular vote by about four and a half percentage points but he barely eked it out in the battleground states and of course thats what matters in this game of winning the electoral college we have to slow our role here because we really dont know how this is all going to end up for example trump could still be experiencing a convention bounce or you know an increase in his approval rating based on an assassination attempt against him just a week and a half ago im not supposed to be here tonight not supposed to be here americans are reacting to so much because to your point in that new york times siena college polling they recorded the highest approval rating ever for former president trump so people are viewing trump in a kinder light in this very moment but will that persist i have no idea also harris may be experiencing a honeymoon moment because theres just been so much positive press about the enthusing of the fundraising etc and by the same point republicans havent really had a chance to define her yet so i think we really have to be careful about assuming that the polls today will the polls tomorrow or even you know a month from now but if harris does lose the national popular vote by a percentage point yes i think theres almost no circumstance in which democrats have an electoral college advantage that results in then winning the electoral college despite losing the national popular vote so she has to basically keep improving on whatever gains shes seeing right now really interesting a galen druke from fivethirtyeight and of course the fivethirtyeight politics podcast which you should all be listening to thank you so much caitlin thank you act upon start here those who avoided the deadliest wildfire in californias history betrayal is one of the hardesttypes of trauma overcome everything he said hewas a like how could he do this he just really didnt think ihad it in me to think something so i did betrayal offathers secret on hulu abc news live honored with eightemmy nominations more than any other streaming newsnetwork and you see news live prime with lindsey davis thefirst and only screaming show nominated for best outstandinglive news program this is abc news live take her on sunday morning on abcs this week there have been several huge wildfires in california in recent years but among the most horrifying has to be the one that basically wiped out the town of paradise california its so hard for people to understand why they cant go back to their homes the entire community of paradise is a toxic wasteland remember this fire killed dozens of people in it destroyed entire neighborhoods part of what made it so deadly was the geography itself paradise was only accessible by one major road i called my husband i just said i i dont think im going to make it out of this its coming in too fast this fire got so big and fast people couldnt escape well on wednes another fire began in northern california near the city of chico and quickly exploded in size it is currently the largest fire the state has seen this year and some of the flames are less than ten miles from the town of paradise lets go to abcs kenneth roth who spent all day yesterday there on the fire line anna what have you been seeing yeah hey brad i mean you can actually see the plume of smoke from sacramento right i mean that is almost hours away and when you were talking about paradise you know i want to tell you i reached out immediately to the football coach at paradise high school who i met after the fire there and you know because he popped in my mind right away there was so much trauma because of that fire for people that live in this area and he said they were really on edge they were waiting for the wind to shift they were concerned and so that trauma rings deep throughout this neighborhood and so to stand there and you get yourself to chico and you can see this massive plume of smoke in the horizon its a really scary deal brad and theres so many similarities here when you talk about that one road i just drove up and down it same thing its a two lane road the only way in the only way out in fact the fire started so quickly that in the middle of the night they started opening up logging roads to help get people out because it was moving so fast im completely surrounded right now so im going to im actually going to bone out of here and see if i can get ahead of this thing because im going to im going to end up getting caught overnight it burned for acres an hour wow right so its scorched acres in the first hours i mean that kind of speed is astonishing especially brad when were not talking about a santa ana wind event here and there are big forests in this part of the state right so so tons of vegetation burning are people okay are structures i mean how threatening has this been yes so you are right to say that is burning in a lot of forest land some of this land you know hasnt burned in but definitely people are being impacted here too entire communities that are under evacuation orders the communities have cohasset and forest ranch both of those are areas that have not seen a lot of fire in recent history people had to be evacuated again many of them leaving in the middle of the night jumping in their car finding themselves in bumper to bumper traffic with nowhere to go weve got approximately vehicles that are sheltering at the radio towers cohasset road there have been homes damaged and destroyed and really were so early on in this that theyre out assessing that right now that number could grow and change in fact we yesterday were up on a ridge and we watched the fire just come right down all of a sudden there was a major shift in the wind here and this just spotted right up its been burning down this ridge here and that one big gust ignited this whole area i mean it is so close to homes and communities it is very scary how did it start yes so that has people enraged right brad because we know we are in a high fire danger situation here theres red flag warnings now high heat and someone has been arrested for arson in this fire brad a year old man they think that he pushed a car sort of into a ravine that was on fire and it just ignited this thing i mean peoples lives will be changed forever because of that and then to add insult to injury on that one brad authorities think that this yearold started the fire and then essentially made this attempt to blend in with those who were evacuating their homes leaving all of their belongings behind because of him wow and again you think about this community right this part of california and how everyone would have been in such a panic to get out quickly you dont realize you might be running alongside the arsonist who started it kayna whitworth there on the fire lines safe thank you so much yeah of course thanks brad a couple of nights ago american fighter jets intercepted a couple of bombers off the coast of alaska and this sort of thing happens sometimes between the us and russia not quite a midair dogfight more like probing the edges of each others airspace they let us know theyre poking around we let them know were watching but what alarmed american officials here was these werent just russian planes they were russian and chinese and they were together lets go to abcs chief global affairs correspondent martha raddatz martha this looked like a very coordinated not an attack but like a coordinated drill near american airspace like what happened here one word brad it provocative what the chinese and the russians were doing was kind of the equivalent of an aerial finger to the us never before has not only the chinese sent strategic bombers off the coast of alaska but certainly not joint exercises together we should say right away these were unarmed strategic bombers the two chinese two russians but they were nuclear capable strategic bombers so the message was very clear were you should be scared of us and look were doing it together what is the response from the us military in a scenario like that because i imagine you see them coming these are not like stealth bombers like they can see them but you dont know theyre unarmed right so do you arm your jets do you treat them like like they could be dropping nukes on us how does the us respond you know the us military reaction is kind of the equivalent of what russia and china did they they are not about to shoot them down they dont think theyre their armed the bombers but by the way the fighter jets that we scrambled in canada scrambled are armed and they are armed because they are theyre defending the united states if there is a there is a challenge or a threat to the united states of america your troops will be at the ready and they will do the right thing and by the way they knew the us the pentagon from the very beginning of the launch that russia and china were doing this this was not a surprise to us we closely monitored these aircraft tracked the aircraft and when they got within about miles of the coast of the us up by alaska that is when the fighter jets launched now by the way china and russia were not trying to keep this secret they wanted everybody to know were doing this they released video showing the bombers taking off yeah yeah showing the bombers taking off in the darkness its all very dramatic video you see these bombers taking you see aerial refueling image released by the russian ministry of defense and you see the cockpit view from one of the russian bombers of the us fighter jets and canadian jets coming up and essentially surrounding the bombers they they follow them for about an before the bombers exit at this point what is the military relationship like between the russians and the chinese even even beyond the pacific martha well were getting closer all the time and that is really whats behind this look you know were strong and mighty militaries but it is not just the pacific it is it is ukraine it is wherever china and russia can join forces and send that message now were joining forces and trying to make the us look as weak as possible they didnt really look very weak in this in this thing with the fighter jets going up there but its just that message where together look out and to hear this its so weird that there is a kind choreography here that individual countries are used to kind of doing with each other but now to have multiple countries kind of doing these rounds around american airspace really bizarre martha raddatz thank you so much you bet brad okay one more quick break when we come back what would southwest airlines be without chaotic boarding process were about to find out abcs david muir the mostwatched news cast in america more americans watch world newstonight with david muir than any other newscast reporting from burlingtonvermont wright in the heart of the path of totality whereverthe story is well take you there youre streaming abc newslive youre streaming abc news live and one last thing how seriously do you take picking out a seat im not afraid of throwing some elbows brad that is abcs clara mcmichael who covers air travel and the eyes of anyone who travels for a living you can divide air carriers into two groups southwest airlines and everyone sometimes my friend will get called first and she can save my seat so you know i like you when you first come first serve the theater slowly im upset im stressed im tired and i hate the last years southwest is very intentionally not assigned seats when you buy your tickets you pay your fare you show up you might get a boarding group but once youre on that plane you select whatever you want that happens to be empty the company really prides itself this egalitarian approach no first class everybody got the same snacks and apparently at one point the flight attendants would tell the passengers you can sit anywhere you want just like at church now to some this is a positive studies have even shown that open seating leads to faster departures which southwest says leads to cheaper flights but the other customers southwest flights are like an anxiety factory what if you got a big family and there arent enough seats to put you all together what if you hate a middle seat so much you would gladly pay to get out of one well yesterday in a historic decision the company decided to finally join the crowd so theyre going to switch to assign seats and a majority of their customers and potential customers as it turns out and this research theyve been doing they prefer seats and they also found that when a customer quote unquote defects to another airline this open seating policy is the number one reason why now they havent said when theyre going to do this but the immediate reaction from some southwest loyalists was one of betrayal this was known to some as the peoples airline no baggage fees no first class were all in this together could this be the beginning of the end so southwest really says this is all about these changing customer needs but no doubt money is is also a part of this and they want to bring in more revenue southwest said on their earnings call that the extra products they offer right now like early bird boarding those generate around these new offerings they said that theyre going to be substantially north of that now southwest is emphatic that it has no plans to alter its other policies like free checked luggage but think about how one thing can lead to another right airlines figured out a while that if people care enough to reserve their seats they also care enough to pay more aisle seats or extra legroom jetblue was known as a budget airline no first class until it did finally start offering mint seats up front that seem suspiciously familiar regardless youve ever lined up to run on board and snatched your seat feeling like a bend the ball about to hit the streets of pamplona those days might be over but you might long for the days where friends fly and the airline actually felt like a friend okay thatll do it for us but i guess in the last couple of weekends a former president has survived a shooting a current president has ended his campaign im going to stay close to my phone for the next couple days but i hope you get out and you have a great weekend start here is produced by

herereame for free thank you for making abc news lon americas number one streaming news im erielle reshef in norwalkconnecticut wherever the story is will take you there yourstreaming abc news live i am trying to say that today on abc news live first its a wildfire emergency on the west nearly fires are burning across several states the urgent efforts now under way to contain the flames and the air quality concerns now posing a dangerous threat train lines in france targeted by arsonists what authorities are calling a massive coordinated attack ahead of tonights olympic opening ceremony kamala harris gets a major endorsement with the obamas now saying about the presumptive democratic nominee and what former president is now saying about debating harris and the new focus on jd vances comments about women without children plus two notorious drug cartel leaders arrested why federal say theyre responsible for the majority of drugs killing americans including fentanyl and we begin with those massive wildfires burning out of control in the western united states more than wildfires are burning right now across california oregon and utah scorching hundreds of thousands of acres and forcing thousands to evacuate the park fire alone has already burned than acres north of sacramento its the largest california has seen so far this year rick carhart cal fire is standing by but lets begin with abcs jaclyn lee on the front in chico jacqueline whats the latest on the park fire hey dan just to paint you a picture because i dont know how much of this you can see but even when we landed in sacramento that is hours from here you could see all the plumes of smoke soot behind me you can see it its just rising up into the atmosphere it is very ominous so right now we are here at base camp and so what ive been told i just spoke with a firefighter whos about to go out to the fire he explained that the current crews have been out fighting the park for the last hours and their priority is to stop the progression so behind me you can see dozens and dozens of dozers theyre going to be going out cutting the line there trying to get this fire under control but the problem that we have is the flames are going so high theyre moving quick that it makes it very difficult to contain these firefighters as they are coming from all over the area san mateo county firefighters now about to go out to try to relieve some of the other guys whove been fighting it again for last hours this is very dangerous conditions and what they told me the most critical part of this is just how windy it has been its a tough orthography that they are fighting and that is why this fire keeps growing now with acres burning it tripled in size in hours diane jacqueline this fire is burning parts of the forest that havent burned in decades how is that affecting efforts to get it under control thats right so you have to think about the conditions that weve been dealing with in california right it has rain significantly in the last few years and we have not seen these massive that we see typically each year so as a result of that the vegetation continues to grow and what that does is it creates all of this fuel so when you have perfect storm which is what we have currently when you have the wind when you have the heat and you have the low humidity all of that just accelerates and thats youre seeing such explosive growth explosive behavior with fires and its causing these spark fires you have the embers going and so its just creating fires that are continuing to jump lines and theyre continuing to spread and you have wildfires all over the area diane all right jaclyn lee thanks jaclyn stay safe and lets get an update from those working to contain these fires rick carhart cal fire joins us now from butte county california rick how are things right now well like we just heard the fires continue to grow just on a side note this fire now has burned more acres than the campfire that so many people in butte county remember so much from almost six years ago now that that did so much damage in the town of paradise so yeah firefighters are its been a long couple of days of this fire and theres a lot more to come the fires not really showing any sign of wanting to sit down and lay down and be done its still growing and its still giving us trouble rick whats the biggest challenge right now or challenges for you and your team in trying to contain this is there something unique about this fire thats making it grow so quickly well there are a lot of factors that are contributing to the growth it is this burning in areas that havent burned in for so long and so theres plenty of fuel weve had to degree temperatures pretty much every day for the last three weeks and so the grasses the brush the fuels are so incredibly dry that theres just nothing keep a spark from turning into a fire so pretty much every ember that goes up in the air is able to start a new a new spot fire and so between trying to to get containment as well as trying to protect structures so we have to pull engines off of land crews off of actually fighting to contain the fire so that they can go and protect homes and structures burning is another factor thats contributing to whats making this so difficult and rick you mentioned protecting homes how many people have been forced to leave their homes so far and do you expect more evacuations to come i cant say im not i have not gotten an operational briefing overnight so i cant say exactly where the fire is right now or what is possibly to come but there are more than people who are affected by the evacuation order just here in all right rick hart with cal fire rick we appreciate your time today thank you and good luck youre welcome thank you very much vice president kamala harris is getting a major endorsement president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama are backing harris as the presumptive democratic nominee making the announcement in a new video we called to say michelle and i couldnt be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through election and into the oval office harris is hitting the campaign trail hard visiting four states in four days but with about days until the election time is running out for her to pick a running mate abc news senior white house correspondent has the latest on that good morning diane vice kamala harris is racing to rally support across the country with the election just about days away she is aggressively hitting campaign trail and going after donald trump hi hey there vice president kamala harris getting a major endorsement and revving up her campaign we call to say michelle and i couldnt be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the oval office the former president and first lady barack and michelle obama throwing their seismic weight behind harris as she finishes her first week as a presidential candidate hitting four states in four days bring it on bring it on and sharpening her attacks on trump as an enemy of the middle class donald trump and his extreme allies want to take our nation back to failed trickle down economic policies back to union busting back to tax breaks for billionaires overnight harris rallying one of the nations largest teachers unions in houston texas we want to ban assault weapons and they want to ban books we choose freedom the vice president dropping her first campaign ad featuring beyonce song freedom the freedom not just to get by but get ahead harris says shes ready to debate donald trump think the voters deserve to see a split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so im ready lets go but trump now backtracking on his pledge to face off on stage his campaign saying it would be inappropriate to schedule things with harris because democrats very well could still change their minds harris quickly pitting trumps words against him asking what happened to any time any place when the nominee was president joe biden and this morning previous comments from trumps vice presidential candidate jd vance first reported by abc calling for people without children to be taxed more we need to reward the things that we think are good and punish the things that we think bad so you talk about tax policy lets tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good if youre making a year and youve got three kids you should pay a different lower tax rate than if youre making the same amount of money and you dont have any kids that simple the comments resurfaced after a clip of vance questioning the leadership abilities of people without kids was already getting blowback were effectively run in this country the democrats via our corporate oligarchs by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that theyve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too and its just a basic fact you look at kamala harris pete buttigieg aoc the entire future of the democrats is controlled by people without children actress jennifer aniston vances comments with her million instagram followers writing i truly cant believe this is coming from a potential vp of the united states and the former wife of harris husband doug emhoff coming to her defense noting that harris coparents their two children kirsten emhoff writing for over ten years since cole and ella were teenagers kamala has been a coparent with doug and i she is loving nurturing fiercely protective and always present i love her blended family and am grateful to have her in it ella emhoff adding how can you be childless when you have cutie pie kids like colony i love my three parents and time is running out for harris to pick a running mate im told shes still considering pool of about a dozen people and on monday governor shapiro whitmer are both campaigning for harris in battleground pennsylvania both of them are considered possible running mates diane a senior white house correspondent selina wang thank you and former president trump is set to host israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu today in maralago itll be their first inperson meeting in nearly four years and it comes after netanyahus address to congress and meetings president biden and vice president harris abc news chief global affairs correspondent martha raddatz has the latest this is one of the most delicate foreign policy issues that any politician faces and its the first one that kamala harris has had to take on is the democrats presumptive nominee the vice presidents meeting followed a lengthy between president biden and netanyahu biden has pushed to the war humanely and bring the hostages home but it was harris who took center stage after her minute session with netanyahu who strongly backing israels right to defend itself but saying bluntly that far too many innocent civilians have been killed calling the situation in gaza devastating at the same time criticizing protesters who burned a flag and shouted antiis slogans here in washington later today netanyahu will meet with donald trump at maralago trump told fox news israel end this war quickly because it has been decimated by the publicity diane she global affairs correspondent martha thank you and france is reporting a massive on the countrys railway network ahead of tonights olympic ceremony officials say arsonists intentionally set fires on three of frances high speed rail lines overnight abcs foreign correspondent james longman is in paris with more on that james whats the latest the investigation into these attacks yeah diane this is an extraordinary story french authorities are saying this is a major coordinated attack on the rail system here rail lines to the north and the of paris and it looks like theyve tried to target areas that perhaps are less secure when youre in paris city center as we are here there is such an enormous security presence it might be that these felt there were soft areas that they could go after and its caused massive delays and cancellations some people maybe more even are going to have their travel impacted by the end of the weekend we understand that signal boxes alongside some of the high speed rail lines here were set fire to just a few moments ago some the french authorities briefed the they said they found incendiary devices in those signal boxes they cut the lines as well some of these lines actually had a knock on effect to the eurostar which is the international service that connects the united kingdom with france so this is a pretty serious situation the united states actually the us counterterrorism office put out a report on the th of june saying that theres a likelihood some kind of disruption here in france around olympics specifically on the rail networks because they pointed to the fact so much of the security apparatus was focused on the capitol it might leave other areas exposed so the investigation is ongoing the intelligence services here part of that investigation but clearly this was designed to disrupt tonights opening diane and james security there was already unprecedented in terms of how many law enforcement personnel are and the barricades everywhere so whats it like there now yeah diane this is the first time an olympics has ever seen an opening ceremony like this there will be a flotilla down send it will go for some hours all the athletes and the flag bearing ceremony pass down it is extraordinary thing to do but it creates a massive security nightmare for the authorities and thats why most of the center of of paris has been on lockdown for some two weeks now just getting where i am now talking to you was im afraid is that a bit of a nightmare i have to go through multiple checkpoints youve got the jeanne down which is the kind of the paramilitary here youve got the police youve got the military on the street youve got hired guards some are on the streets of city ensuring that the security situation remains and this is the largest mobilization since the war so its an extraordinary situation here in paris all for this opening ceremony one hopes that this will will weaken all of ease off slightly over the coming days after the opening ceremony when the city gets back up and running but fundamentally the paris games the whole point of them is that they want to have these venues at some of the worlds most famous landmarks outside the eiffel tower or the arc de triomphe but what that means is the security has to be in place too so we feel it at the moment hoping perhaps when the games get underway it might not be quite so tight and a beautiful view but a big effort james hopefully that means a safe opening ceremony for you and everyone else there thank you and coming up two notorious drug cartel leaders arrested federal officials say theyre

held before leaving athens and crossing the mediterranean making a grand entrance into the french port of marseilles aboard a historic ship from there it embarked on its very own tour de france from the french riviera it was passed on underwater to the highest peaks of the snow covered alps there were chateaux along the way a with the prince of monaco even a red carpet moment at the cannes film

in this case yeah the answer the justice department now closely monitoring this case and benjamin crump and the family members are calling on authorities to continue move this case quickly through the

fired and charged ten days of the incident diane at this point were continuing to wait for more pretrial hearings and a date which has not yet been set diane all right alex in chicago for us thanks alex and prince harry speaking out for the first time since winning his legal battle against mirror group newspapers in a new documentary the duke of sussex says he wont risk bringing his wife meghan markle back to the uk because he fears for their safety harry gave a rare sit down interview in tabloids on trial aired last night in the uk abcs lama hasan has more from london harrys not just vaguely talking about safety here you go so far as to say whether its a knife or acid it is these are the things that are a genuine concern for me what do you make of that yes you are absolutely right prince harry was speaking publicly for the first time since he was just one of his legal battles back in december and as you can imagine he made quite a number of headlines he says that hes worried that negative tabloid narratives around his own family could lead as you rightly said to a knife or acid attack against his wife meghan if she were to come back to the uk he says its one of the reasons why he wont bring his wife back to this country he says quote its still dangerous and all it takes is one lone actor one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read and whether its a knife or acid whatever is he says these are all things that are of genuine concern for me its one of the reasons why i wont bring my wife back to this country so this is a big deal don because its the first time that hes actually spoken about these fears public and it kind of explains why the last few times the prince was in the uk he was solo and without his wife diane and in this hour long special prince harry says the tabloids legal battle was central to the rift between the royal family but he also calls the battle a david versus goliath situation and he says queen elizabeth supported him in battle so how is the royal family responding now yes and no response yet from the royal family but prince harry does say he believes that his fight against the press was central in destroying his relationship with his family now youll recall that members of his family have not to fight the tabloids prince william reportedly settled for a huge sum of money out of court but harry does say as you rightly said that his grandmother queen was on board so so far i havent really seen much in terms of reaction but what this the story has definitely been picked up by papers and i think its because it really gives us an idea of what was going on behind closed doors its also the first time weve heard prince harry or meghan for that matter raise security so what could this new documentary with that and the other things mentioned mean for the royal family for the monarchy going forward how are people in the uk responding yeah look so not much response i think its quite difficult to say how this will affect the royal family moving forward if anything this just again it explains the reasons behind some issues that we have seen play out recently like harrys rift with his father charles and his brother prince william harry claims its largely because of his battle with the tabloids and of course as well as well as why he doesnt want to bring his wife back to the uk again because of the genuine fears he has that she might fall victim to knife or acid attack but moving forward im not quite sure how this documentary will affect the royal family i think it just us an idea again what was going on behind palace doors and just why that was and ongoing rift i should say between prince harry and brother and of course his father king charles diana all right lama

thank you and now its time for our weekly segment but tell it like it is were abc news contributor dr alok patel shares some health advice on the topics that matter most to you and today hes answering some of your questions so dr patel were going to get straight into it with an anonymous viewer question this viewer wants to know how does diet and nutrition affect adhd symptom management and treatment and i promise i am not the anonymous viewer but i am very about the answer here diane you may not be the anonymous viewer but i get asked this question all the time because nutritional to adhd management is a growing topic theres a lot of research now right now there is no official dietary protocol but research has shown that healthy balanced diets do improve symptoms in individuals who have adhd and the opposite diets are high in processed foods worsen symptoms now is it because our function better when were eating nutritious foods is it because of a specific deficiency in nutrients such as vitamin d magnesium or iron no one really knows but it is important to note that youre not doing this alone and i really respect anyone out there who is trying to take their familys medical conditions especially conditions such as adhd into their own hands and theyre looking at symptomatic management such as with a diet just make sure you talk to a health care practitioner about this and also diane kudos to you about amplifying this conversation and normalizing it so people out there including all the anonymous ones feel empowered to go and ask these questions to take control thank you friend i never would have gotten diagnosed if other people hadnt shared their stories and made me realize hey wait that sounds like me so just my attempt to pay it forward to anyone who i can help with my story and great advice on that dr patel i be you with more questions but right now i want to get to lillians question from san francisco lillian wants to know what daily vitamins or supplements do you suggest for toddlers lets continue on the nutrition train so generally speaking if toddlers are eating a healthy balanced diet i know thats asking a lot because they are they dont actually need any supplementation now there are certain indications such as chronic illnesses restrictive diets delays in growth or specific vitamin deficiencies where a doctor may recommend supplementation such as vitamin d toddler should be taking about ius or international units per day you cant get that diet sometimes its easier to take a multi vitamin depending on the indication and with restrictive diets some kids may not get enough nutrients such as iron b or zinc so it is important youre having a conversation with your doctor at all if youre concerned about the vitamins and minerals your toddler needs and i just want to make the psa and say that if you go to the store and you see those supplements that say things like supports bone growth improves the immune system helps your toddler grow up to go to an ivy league school a lot of that is marketing terms know what youre getting and what youre buying and talk to your health care professional how about helping your toddler pay attention to you when you talk to them wheres that vitamin you know thats a vitamin called patience dedicated to dr alok patel always great to have you thank you friend thank you and if

are heading into the unknown never ever ever it doesnt get any more cutting edge and this with so much at stake so much the line more americans turn here than any other newscast abc news world news tonight with david muir americas number most watched newscast across all of television and streaming on hulu im a rock and roll star im not a saint im jon bon jovi jon jovi the new special what you have not yet seen jon bon jovi with michael strahan now streaming on hulu reporting on the trial of hunter in wilmington delaware im olivia rubin wherever the story well take you there youre streaming abc news live welcome back to abc news live opening ceremony at the olympic games will look a little different than in years past rather than a parade of athletes entering a stadium the french have given it a twist with athletes parading down one of the most famous rivers in the world but there is another surprise everyones hoping to see tonight rumors are swirling about celine and lady gaga performing together abcs lara spencer more all by just hours to go until the olympics opening ceremony reports that superstar celine dion wont be all by herself performing on stage i wanna hold them like they do and take this place instead word is shell be teaming up with lady gaga for the ultimate duet now we cant wait for the superstars keeping a poker face if you will about the claims sparking a fan frenzy as theyre spotted taking paris by storm okay did you enjoy the restaurant where i bought multiple outlets claiming the two superstars were seeing the french classic la vie en rose rose oh a song gaga belted out in a star is born french president emmanuel playing coy about dionnes appearance saying only it would be great news and i would be immensely happy if she could be at this opening ceremony the chance to perform at the olympics monumental and makes for an incredible comeback youll remember the spice girls reunited for londons closing if celine does take the stage it would mark her first live performance since announcing her diagnosis with stiff person syndrome in and would be nearly years since she brought down the house at the atlanta olympics in singing the power of the dream and lara spencer and james longman join me now with more lara what are people there saying about this possibility of celine dion performing which would be her first performance since revealing her diagnosis with stiff person syndrome a big comeback would be what a stage for a comeback celine dion of course knows how to sort of set the stage she does everything big she also like all of the here knows about resilience right and this would be such an incredible place for her to make the comeback because lets face it she might be from montreal but the french think that she belongs to them before before celine became so near and dear to all of our hearts she was a huge star with a lot of french hits and we have been told many french people that it would be so poignant if she did in fact her return to the stage right here at the opening game at the opening of the games sure would be james you were at the tokyo olympics in those games had been postponed due to the pandemic so how different are these games already from what you saw in tokyo yeah diane i mean those tokyo games were really strange i mean covid meant that there could be no spectators no one was there so it was a really strange games obviously thats completely different now in paris not to put too much of a dampener on it weve had a great time so far but so far the security situation here in paris makes it feel like its almost covid because no one is allowed to be anywhere on the streets you might hear in the background that theres a police down there with a loudspeaker telling people to get off the street the security situation is intense didnt feel that way in tokyo but tonight will be special i mean for the first time ever an opening ceremony with a flotilla down the side i mean that is going to be amazing were looking forward to it i also remember you guys having snazzy matching jackets in tokyo can i can we just show you please i mean please your names are on the back thats so good yeah ive been spending too much time you literally moved identically on the beat without even a queue lara with these sports have been amazing weve really enjoyed them you can tell honestly it shows in your coverage and lara one of my favorite parts has been watching you both testing some of these sports ahead of the game so what event are you most excited for honestly i had never heard of kayak cross and maybe you havent either because its never been an olympic sport it is at this games for the first time and its insane i mean its basically motocross on the water and it starts by getting flung off of a platform and then and then the boaters are like hitting each other james and i were just trying to stay afloat when when we succeed no no it was sad it was sad but i cannot wait to see that and great britain has the medal as the guy whos going to get the gold medal very likely a british guy so were rooting for him yeah team usa and now i see that youre watching our incredible in table tennis otherwise known as ping pong in my basement and i have to brag on on james longman hes actually very good were slightly competitive and i would say that he definitely was better than me in the table tennis but we both equally in love with amy wang who is tonight i believe in her opening shes against vanuatu yes exactly which to be honest with you lara had a little bit of a problem recognizing that as a nation but yes they did we established that vanuatu is in fact a country is competing at these games and amy will be playing yes that that so were really excited to see that and then i dont know if you know this but i was a diver penn state university captain of the diving team so i will be rooting for the americans and i know you love i will dally oh yeah yeah but also team usa oh no and now youre seeing there is artistic swimming i mean thats i should to first of all get a gold medal for wearing a bathing suit i years old you said no anywhere here you are dropping the bathing suit what are you rocking the bathing suit running the diving skills and i have to ask was your favorite kayak crossed you left james in the dust of course are you im coming for you diane macedo he lost so it looks like we are out of time no sorry james so sorry he literally thought he added he was like like like see you later and then his his kayak went backwards and i was like

youre streaming abc news live live im dan maceda today on abc news live first the wildfire emergency on the west coast nearly fires are burning across several states the urgent efforts now under way to contain the flames in the air quality concerns posing a dangerous threat train lines in france targeted by arsonists what authorities are calling a massive coordinated attack of tonights olympic opening ceremony and vice president harris gets a major endorsement with the obamas now saying about the presumptive democratic nominee what former president trump is saying about debating harris and the new focus on jd vance comments about women without children plus two notorious drug cartel leaders arrested why federal officials say their responsible for the majority of drugs killing americans including fentanyl but first massive wildfires are burning out of control in the western united states more than wildfires are burning right now across california oregon and utah scorching hundreds of thousands of acres and forcing thousands to evacuate the park fire alone has already burned more than acres north of sacramento its the largest wildfire californias seen so far this year were going to talk to some victims of these fires coming up but were going to start things off with abcs jaclyn lee whos there on the front lines and meteorologist melissa griffin watching the weather for us jacqueline whats it like there in and how are people reacting to this park fire thats right dan so we flew into sacramento which is hours from here and even when you land you see all of the plumes of smoke and so i dont know if you can see this but behind me it looks like there is a whole bunch of clouds but thats actually the smoke coming directly from the fire so right now were here at base camp and what is theres a lot of activity going on especially over where theyre feeding firefighters so whats happening is ever since the fire broke out about hours ago those who are part of the initial attack were fighting it for the last hours they are just about to get relief so theyre starting to come back were seeing fire crews from all over california weve spoken with firefighters from riverside theres people from ventura county they all drove up and their job is now to relieve those firefighters so the ultimate goal they say is to just contain the fire and what were seeing just this explosive rapid growth that weve seen happen just so quickly which is what makes this fire so stunning its only contained theres more than acres burning and so from the firefighters we spoke with many said that theyre just excited to get out there others say they know what to expect the biggest problem that theyre dealing with is the environment so not only are you dealing with low humidity youre dealing with very hot temperatures very high temperatures and then of course the wind the wind is whats really dragging this fire out and pushing it pushing it around and so we spoke with a firefighter who explained that they were actually able to prevent the fire from spreading into the town of paradise they were able to cut it out and move it further north which is you know very scary for many residents who obviously dealt with the fire in which killed more than it killed people so obviously theres a lot of people in this community that are dealing with a of trauma and so this of course is bringing back some very unpleasant memories but ultimately the main goal is just containing this fire diane and melissa how bad are these air quality concerns and where is the biggest danger right now that not only are we seeing these red flag warnings fires smoke and were seeing very poor air quality especially across the northwest where all those fires are burning lets take a look at chico though thats where we do have the red flag in effect thats because we had these southwesterly winds up to mile per hour gusts on top of that low humidity down to today and that heat continues for at least one more day there that red flag warning stays in effect for the sacramento valley through tonight but air quality alerts continue look at this canada not only is the smoke from all the fires in the us theyre coming from the nearly one that was an active fires in canada and then in the us we have over active large fires across the west youre going to see these smoky skies continue right through today you can see all of these dark red areas kind of just blanketing parts of the interior pacific northwest you have washington state oregon up through northern california there and that smoke will to spread through montana into parts of wyoming with a very heavy continuing into the weekend so unhealthy air quality will persist as long as these fires persist diane and melissa firefighters complained of the heat and wind posing a tough challenge in trying to get these fires under control does it look like thats letting up time soon well the good news diane is that the heat is letting up were expecting all of the heat advisories excessive heat warnings to expire today in the west and were going to be seeing actually potentially below two normal average temperatures for much of the west so the good news is that we have that but the problem is its going to heat right back as we head into the end of july into early august so a brief reprieve but the heat returns all right jaclyn lee melissa griffin thank you both and these fires have scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness but theyre also having a real human impact forcing thousands to evacuate and destroying homes and businesses natalie orozco and clay ferguson join me now they lost their home in this fire as well as their family owned reptile breeding business i cant imagine what you both are going through right now so first of all im so and thank you for coming on to share your story thank you for having us thank you feeling right now and how did you find out that both your home and your business were gone well it was it was really intense because we managed to get all the animals out and out after that the rest of the night was just kind of like a waiting we couldnt get any information whether the house had made it or not and actually till a news reporter that i had spoken to early in the morning befriended me and told me as soon as they knew she would let know and she had sent me pictures of of our home and was just gone and theres nothing left oh what went through your mind when you saw those those photos of what was your house and whats left oh it was it was kind of a shock at first you know youve been hearing rumors here and there the fire had made it to rock creek and but theyre battling and i had heard that the vineyard across the street was still standing so you know that gave you a lot of hope that maybe your house was still standing as well and i scrolled through an article online with a vague picture and a description of one of my destroyed structures due to the fire and was a really small clip but you know your house you know the things that were there and there was a couple by the way by that the way my wall was there was a hat my mom had just given me on a camping trip this summer that was that i dropped on the way out we were running and it was just on the floor in the driveway and it was there really and it was hard to deny that thats your house its its really shocking to find out were just happy at the end of the day we were able to get all of our animals out i mean it cost us everything but we got them all out and were just were happy we saved to all the lives we could its such a huge bright spot in your story and so where are the animals now what kind of support you getting and how do you plan to move forward from this weve had just a huge huge support from our community everybodys rallied together to help we had help the evacuation even when there was blockades that wouldnt allow people through theres people parked at the blockade down road ready waiting for us to bring them animals and i have i have hundreds of reptiles dispersed throughout like five or six different homes my go my tortoises amazing people that are going to help im getting an influx of calls from customers that had for many years offering to foster and were just going to were going to move and were going to get through this together as a community were going to get these animals into safe places temporarily until we can get back on our feet i mean you guys are both just a pillar of strength now i cant imagine and again im so sorry but im glad that you have this community and youre seeing that support come through and lili orozco clay ferguson in california thank you both thank you so much and speaking of fires france is reporting a

assault weapons and they want to ban books we choose freedom the vice president dropping her first campaign ad featuring beyonce song freedom the freedom not just to get by but get ahead harris says shes ready to debate donald trump i think the voters deserve to see a split screen that exists in this race on a stage and so im ready lets go but trump now backtracking on his pledge to face off on stage his campaign saying it would be inappropriate to schedule things with harris because democrats very well could still change their minds harris quickly pitting words against him asking what happened to any time any place when the nominee was president joe biden and this morning previous from trumps vice presidential candidate jd vance first reported by abc calling for people without children to be taxed more we need to reward the things that we think are good and punish the things that we think are bad so you talk about tax policy lets tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good if youre making a year and youve got three kids you should pay a different lower tax rate than if youre making the same amount of money and you dont have any kids its that simple the comments resurfaced after a clip of vance the leadership abilities of people without kids was already getting blowback were effectively run in this country via the democrats via our corporate oligarchs by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that theyve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too and its just a basic fact you look at kamala harris pete buttigieg aoc the entire future of the democrats is controlled by people without children actress jennifer aniston sharing vances comments with her million

present i love her blended family and am grateful to have her in it ella emhoff adding how can you be childless when you have cutie pie kids like colony i love my three parents and time is running out

operations attorney general merrick garland a rare video statement on the arrests the justice department will not rest until every cartel leader member and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable abc news senior justice producer jack doherty joins me now jack thanks for coming on can you talk about background here who these two men are and why its such a big deal to now have them in custody so these two men are two top leaders of the sinaloa cartel ismael almario zubaydah he was one of the cofounders and coheads of the sinaloa cartel hes been at it for more than years and the other man that was arrested joaquin guzman lopez hes the son of el chapo el chapo was the head of the sinaloa cartel who is currently in a us prison these men are indicted in three different districts in the united states the soil cartel is responsible for a huge majority of the dominant cartel dealing in fentanyl methamphetamine cocaine and other drugs in the united states and globally theyre responsible really that drug in particular fentanyl is responsible the deaths of tens of thousands of americans every year so getting these two men in custody is absolutely significant its a big deal at the justice department they are very excited about the news these men are in custody and so jack how did they actually what actually led up to this arrest how did they get them in the country to get them in custody well were still piecing together details but it looks like something out of a movie these men it appears believed that they were going to northern mexico to inspect a clandestine airstrip is that up landing in texas and they are greeted by the fbi and agents from the department of homeland security homeland security investigations and so it was it was an extraordinary turn to be able to get these men to basically fly into the united states and be arrested by us agents so interesting jack that i know youre stay on top of this for us thank you sure

learning sean grayson who pulled the trigger was discharged from the us army for serious misconduct in after less than two years of service and held six different police jobs in the last four years sheriffs office body camera video showing grayson his partner at masseys home after she reported a prowler what about windows after the deputies enter the house massey struggling answer their questions what is your last name should not take my last name the situation in quickly escalating when massey is asked to remove a pot of boiling water from the stove for hot or hot even water away from up in the water oh i refused to let the neighbors choose that i feel better to say no hot cross in shots fired shots fired shots fired grayson did not turn on his body camera until after shooting massey explaining the situation to responding officers who ask wheres the gun we dont know she had a boiling water and came at me with boiling water are you sure yeah she said she was going to rebuke me in the name of and came out with boiling water grayson fired from the force and indicted on three counts of first degree murder and aggravated battery charges for the july six shooting he has pleaded not guilty and abcs alex perez joins me now from chicago more alex whats the latest on this investigation well diane were expecting authorities will release masseys autopsy report at some point today diane meanwhile grayson remains in custody a judge has ordered he be held without bond diane and alex we recently learned deputy grayson worked for six agencies and for years now were finding out about this discharged from the army how is the sacramento county sheriffs office responding to that and what are the victims whats the victims family saying yet and the victims family members and their attorney benjamin crump saying these perhaps were all red flags and so theyre asking to go back and take a closer look at this former deputys now former deputys past and determine if there are other cases that need to be investigated or have a closer look at a family members and the family attorney believe that perhaps there were things there in the that should have prevented grayson from being an officer at all diane and alex civil rights attorney ben crump is representing masseys family he says the body camera footage is quote the worst police shooting video ever the justice department also confirmed that its looking into the shooting so what happens in this case yeah the answer the justice department now closely monitoring this and benjamin crump and the family members are calling on authorities to continue to move this case quickly through the court legal system and it has been moving unusually fast compared to other cases in some instances these cases can take years to make their way through the court system in this case we saw this officer was fired and charged within ten days of the incident diane at this point continuing to wait for more pretrial hearings and a trial date which has not yet been set diane all right alex perez chicago for us thanks alex and prince harry speaking for the first time since winning his legal battle against mirror group newspapers in a new documentary the duke of sussex says he wont risk bringing wife meghan markle back to the uk because he fears for their safety harry gave a rare sit down interview in tabloids on trial which aired last night in the uk abcs lama hassan has more from london harrys not just vaguely talking about safety here he goes so far as to say whether its a knife or acid whatever it is these are the things that are a genuine concern for me what do you make of that yeah so youre absolutely right prince harry was speaking publicly for the first time since he was just one of his legal battles back in december and as you can imagine he made quite a number of headlines he that hes worried that negative tabloid narratives around his own family could lead as you rightly said to a knife or acid attack against his wife meghan if she were come back to the uk he says its one of the reasons why he wont bring his wife back to this country he says quote its dangerous and all it takes is one lone actor one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read and its a knife or acid whatever it is he says these are all that are of genuine concern for me its one of the reasons why i wont bring my wife back to this country so this is a big deal don because its the first time that hes actually spoken about these fears publicly and it kind of explains why the last few times the prince was back in the uk he was solo and without his wife diane and in this hour long special prince harry says the tabloids legal battle was central to the rift between the royal family but he also calls the battle a david goliath situation and he says queen elizabeth supported him in that battle so how is the royal family responding now yes and no response yet from the royal family but prince harry does say believes that his fight against the press was central in destroying his relationship with his family now youll recall that members his family have decided not to fight the tabloids prince william reportedly for a huge sum of money out of court but does say as you rightly said that his grandmother the late queen was on board so so far i havent really seen much in terms of reaction but what this story has definitely been picked up by several papers and i think its because it really gives us an idea of what was going on behind palace doors also not the first time weve heard prince harry or meghan for that matter raised security concerns so what could this new documentary with that and the other things mentioned mean for the royal family for the monarchy going and how are people in the uk responding yeah look at so far not much response i think its quite difficult to say how this will affect the royal family moving forward if anything this again it explains the reasons behind some issues that we have seen play out recently like harrys rift with his father king charles and his brother prince william harry claims its largely because of his battle with the tabloids and of course as well as well as to why he doesnt want to bring his wife back to the uk again because of the genuine fears he has that she might fall victim to knife or acid attack but moving forward im not quite sure how this documentary will affect the royal family i think it just gives an idea again what was going on behind palace doors and just why that was and an rift i should say between prince harry and brother and of course his father king charles diane all right lama hasan thank you and southwest airlines ceo is sharing new details after a meeting with federal investigators

theyve now performed the first in human artificial transplant the device is only temporary but could buy patients much time erielle reshef has the details this is remarkable during that groundbreaking procedure in houston surgeons implanted new device called by the core to a total artificial heart its the first of its kind to be transferred into a patient thats yearold man with end stage heart failure was awaiting a human heart transplant doctors removed the bottom half of his heart and completely replaced it with this artificial device the surgery place earlier this month as part of the fdas early feasibility study now the device is made of titanium and it pumps and replaces both ventricles of a failing heart experts say it is durable its resistant to wear and reliable as a temporary replacement but if it is proven to be safe and effective this could possibly be a permanent solution in the future to down on the dependance on donors heart failure of course is a leading cause of death globally million americans are afflicted with this potentially fatal condition so the prospect of this new device of course is offering a beacon of hope for any patient awaiting a donation and

indeed incredible erielle reshef thank you and now its time for our weekly segment but tell it like it is for abc news contributor dr patel shares some health advice on the topics that matter most to you and today hes answering some of your questions so dr patel were going to get straight into it with an anonymous viewer question this viewer wants know how does diet and nutrition affect adhd symptoms and treatment and i promise i am not the anonymous viewer but i am very curious about the answer here diane you may not the anonymous viewer but i get asked this question all the time because nutritional approaches to adhd management is a growing topic a lot of research here now right now there is no official dietary protocol but research has shown that healthy balanced diets do improve symptoms in individuals who have adhd and opposite diets that are high in processed foods worsen symptoms now is it because our bodies function better when were eating nutritious foods is it because of a specific deficiency and nutrients such as vitamin d magnesium or iron no one really knows but it is important to note that youre not this alone and i really respect anyone out there whos trying to take their familys medical conditions especially conditions such as adhd into their own and theyre looking at symptomatic management such as with a diet just make sure you talk to a health care practitioner about this and also then kudos to you about amplifying this conversation and normalizing it so people out there including all the anonymous ones feel empowered to go and ask these to take control thank you friend i never would have gotten diagnosed if other people hadnt shared their stories and made me realize hey wait that sounds like so just my attempt to pay it forward to anyone who i can help with my story and great advice on that dr patel id be you with more questions but right now i want to get to lillians question from san francisco lillian wants to know what daily are supplements do you suggest for toddlers that lets continue on the nutrition train so generally speaking if are eating a healthy balanced diet i know thats asking a lot they are they dont actually need any supplementation now are certain indications such as chronic illnesses restrictive diets delays growth or specific vitamin deficiencies where a doctor may recommend supplementation in such as vitamin d toddlers should be taking about ius or international units per day you cant get that with diet sometimes its easier to take a multi vitamin depending on the indication and with restrictive diets some kids may not get enough nutrients such as iron b or zinc so it is important youre having a with your doctor at all if youre concerned about the vitamins and minerals your toddler needs and i just want to make the psa and say that if you go to the store and you see those supplements that say things like support bone growth improves the immune system helps toddler grow up to go to an ivy league school a lot of that is marketing terms know what youre getting and what youre buying and talk to a health care professional how helps your toddler pay attention to you when you talk to them wheres that vitamin you know thats thats the vitamin called patience dedicated care dr alok patel always great to have you thank friend thank you and if you have questions for dr patel him a message

abc news this is starting to be in the know and get a different take on the top stories start here that thats a part of the story that you didnt see coming make it your daily first listen wherever you get your podcasts welcome back to abc news live opening ceremony at the olympic games will look a little different in years past rather than a parade of athletes entering a stadium the french have given it a twist with athletes parading down one of the most famous rivers in the world but there is another surprise everyones hoping to see tonight rumors are swirling about celine dion and lady gaga performing together abcs lara spencer has more all by just hours to go until the olympics opening ceremony reports that superstar celine dion wont be all by herself performing on stage i wanna hold them like they do and take this stage instead word is shell be teaming up with lady gaga for the ultimate duet the superstar is keeping a poker face if you will about the claims sparking a fan frenzy as their taking paris by storm did you enjoy the restaurant where i multiple outlets claiming the two superstars will sing the french classic la vie en rose also a song gaga belted out in a star is born french president emmanuel macron coy about dions appearance saying only it would be news and i would be immensely happy if she could be at this opening ceremony the chance to perform at the olympics monumental and makes for an incredible comeback youll remember the spice girls reunited for londons closing ceremony if celine does take the stage it would mark her first live performance since announcing diagnosis with stiff person syndrome in and would be nearly years since she brought down the house at the atlanta olympics in singing the power of dream and lara spencer and james longman join me now with more lara what are people there saying about this possibility of celine dion performing tonight which would be her first performance since revealing her diagnosis with stiff person syndrome big comeback would be what a stage for a comeback celine dion of course knows how to sort of set the stage she does everything big she also like all of the athletes here knows about resilience right and this would be such an place for her to make the comeback because lets face it she might be from montreal but the french think that she belongs to them before before celine became so near and dear to all of our hearts she was a huge star with a lot of french hits and we have been told by many people that it would be so poignant if she did in fact make her return to the stage right here at the opening game at the opening of the games sure would be james you were at the tokyo olympics in those games had been postponed due to the pandemic so how different are these games already from what you saw in tokyo yeah diane i mean those tokyo games really strange i mean covid meant that there could be no spectators no one was there so it was a really strange games obviously thats completely now in paris not to put too much of a dampener on it weve had a great time so far but so far the security situation here in paris makes it feel like its almost covid because no one is allowed to be anywhere on the streets you might hear in the background that theres a police down there with a loudspeaker telling people to get off the street the security situation is intense didnt feel that way in tokyo but tonight will be special i mean for the first time ever an opening ceremony with a flotilla down the side i mean that is going to be amazing were looking forward to it i also dont remember you guys having snazzy matching jackets in tokyo can i can we just show you please please get around the back thats so good yeah weve been spending too much time together you literally moved identically on the beat without even queue lara weve weve these have been amazing weve really enjoyed them you can tell honestly it shows in your coverage and lara one of my favorite parts has been watching you both action testing some of these sports ahead of the game so what event are you most excited for honestly i had never heard of kayak cross and maybe you havent either because its never been an olympic sport it is at this games for the first time and its insane i mean its basically motocross on the water and it starts by getting flung off of a platform and then and then the boaters are like hitting each other james and i were just trying to stay afloat when when we succeed no no it was sad it was sad but i cannot wait to see that and great britain has the medal as the guy whos going to get the gold medal very likely a british guy so were rooting for him yeah team usa and now i see that youre watching our incredible moves in table tennis otherwise known as ping pong in my basement and i have to brag on on james longman hes actually very good were were slightly competitive and i would say that he definitely was better than me in the table tennis but we both equally in love with amy wang who competing tonight i believe in her opening shes in vanuatu yes exactly which which ill be honest with you lara had a little bit of a problem with recognizing that as a nation but yes again we established that vanuatu is in fact a country is competing at these games and amy will be playing yes that that so were really excited to see that and then i dont know if you know this but i was a diver penn state university captain of the diving team so i will be rooting for americans and i know you love i will daly oh yeah tom yeah also to me its like oh no and now youre seeing there is artistic i mean thats i should to first of all get a gold medal for wearing a bathing suit at years old said no you look amazing you are rocking the bathing suit what are you rocking the bathing suit rocking the diving skills and i have to ask was your favorite kayak crossed because you left james in the dust of course are you im coming for you diane maceda he was so it looks like

wherever you get your podcasts reporting from the federal district courthouse in washington dc im terry moran wherever the news is will take you there were streaming abc news live hi im jaime saito today on abc news live first a wildfire emergency on the west coast fires are burning across several states the urgent efforts now underway to contain the flames and the air quality concerns now posing a dangerous threat train lines in france targeted by arsonists what authorities are calling a massive coordinated attack ahead of tonights olympic opening ceremony vice president harris gets a major endorsement with the obamas are now saying about the presumptive democratic nominee but former president trump is saying about debating and the new focus on jd vances comments about women without children and two notorious drug cartel leaders arrested why federal officials say theyre responsible for the majority of drugs killing including fentanyl but first massive are burning out of control in the western united states more than six major wildfires are burning right now across california oregon and utah scorching hundreds of thousands of acres and thousands to evacuate the park fire alone has already burned more than acres north of sacramento thats the largest wildfire california has seen so far this year butte county sheriff corey haney is standing by for us but lets begin with abcs jaclyn lee and melissa griffin jacqueline youre there on the front lines in chico right now what are you seeing in terms of the park and how its progressing right and so i mean the biggest issue is just how rapidly it is evolving and continuing to grow so here were at base camp this is where firefighters from over the state are coming to get their supplies and just to get so what were seeing is they just had their operational briefing so what that means is these fire crews that are about to go to the fire to help relieve the people who have been fighting it for the last hours they are being told what the plan is what their of attack is so some are going to be just trying to contain the fire others are focused on protecting structures like homes and whatnot we have more people evacuated and with the firefighters that weve spoken with many say they are just ready to get out here theyre ready to fight this because it is just they have not seen a fire grow this quickly so were seeing more than acres burning only is contained and melissa how bad are these air quality concerns right now and is there one particular area in more danger than others yeah im most concerned with the northwest and thats exactly where most of these fires burning with fires you have a lot of smoke so really bringing those poor air quality alerts to so many americans over here the red flag though look at the sacramento valley thats where the park fire is that red flag warning is in effect through friday evening so thats through tonight very low humidity throughout the day down to combined with those gusty gusting up to and the heat sticking around for one more day all of those factors are going to make it difficult for these firefighters to contain that fire which is why containment is still so low and it keeps growing but red flag warnings continue to stretch into montana and idaho thats why we could also see dry thunderstorms and lightning heres the smoke we have so wildfires in canada and all across the western us and that is whats you could see it there on the map of the red all that smoke and poor air quality diane all right jaclyn lee melissa griffin thank you both and the fires are posing serious challenges for law enforcement and theyve worked try to keep people out of harms way i want to bring in sheriff corey joni in butte county california sheriff i know its a busy time so thank you coming on what are things like for you on the ground right now yeah its a very serious situation up here as you heard the current acreage of this fire on acres i think significant given the fact that in butte was the site of californias most destructive and deadly fire the campfire which consumed less acreage so you can see the magnitude of this fire so sheriff corey what are the biggest challenges the department is facing right now what part of your task is to keep people safe how hard is that right now so challenging you know were law enforcement responsible for warning people of the danger and coordinating the evacuation this fire began on wednesday and our effort to warn people began then we have been putting the messages out as often as we can as you know there about people that are subject to evacuate in orders but some of these communities the two primary communities that are affected forest ranch and cohasset are populated by a resilient people who often dont heed the warning and trying to convince them to go before its too late has been a challenge and so sheriff kory what do residents in northern california need to know right now well first off its important for them to know these in which they live in and they can go to the sheriffs website under the address and ultimately get that information but theyve got to pay attention to the message that were putting out and heed the warnings we dont do evacuation orders unless we truly that the community is being threatened and we try give people as much notice as possible we recognize how much pressure it puts on people to have to evacuate how it is for them but we do it because its very insecure in the uk shown that if you dont get out you can lose life all right butte county sheriff corey joni corey we appreciate time today sheriff thank you good luck yeah thank you and speaking of fires france is reporting a massive attack the countrys railway network ahead of tonights olympic ceremony officials say arsonists intentionally set fires on three of frances high speed rail lines overnight abc news foreign james longman is in paris with more on that hi james so whats the latest on the investigation into these attacks well authorities havent said who they believe this to be but they have found incendiary devices at some of these locations inside the signal boxes right alongside those high speed rail lines where these fires broke out so its now going to take days to get these lines back up and running hundreds of workers are now on these trying desperately to get these rail lines functioning again because at this point through the weekend they predict more than people could be affected by this so trying to get to paris for these games of course one in four eurostars from london thats the international service that connects the united kingdom with france has been canceled and so this has caused huge amounts of delay and you know its just a huge issue for france to be with on the day that its hosting this opening ceremony we understand these are three lines to the north and the east of paris where these fires broke out the investigation ongoing intelligence services are involved in it but back in june it was actually the us counterterrorism agency that put out a report saying that with so much security focused on paris other parts this country might be left vulnerable and that seems to be exactly what has happened diane and james its now just a couple of hours the start of the olympics opening ceremony so how the security situation in paris now given how high it was before this attack yeah i mean look its two weeks basically the center of paris been on lockdown were going to see this extraordinary opening ceremony this flotilla going down the sand some hours of the flag bearing ceremony where athletes will go down this river but as a result it means that the lockdown has been incredibly intense the whole point of these games is that they want paris wanted to host it right the very center of the city alongside all the major landmarks but its caused really a nightmare for a lot of parisians who live there as a maze of checkpoints youve got to go through even getting to this position here took a long time this morning you need multiple qr codes and pieces of paper so its been difficult but one hopes that once this opening ceremony through the security situation will ease slightly that james longman thank you vice president kamala harris is getting a major endorsement former president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama are backing as the presumptive democratic nominee it comes as former president trump is set to host israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu today at mar a lago and you can see there netanyahu just arrived at the airport in fort lauderdale just a little while ago abc news white house correspondent karen travers joins me along with senior reporter katherine faulders for more on that karen the obamas are the last major party leaders to now formally back vice president harris in this race how critical is that for her you know diane its a significant endorsement but its one that was not surprising not unexpected it was more a matter of when it was going to come because as you point out the former president the last prominent democrat to publicly endorse vice president in this race for the white house it was notable in his statement week that he withheld that he did not say anything publicly on sunday after president biden said he was not seeking reelection but now say theyre all in theyre going to do everything they can to get her through this and into the oval office and that includes doing events likely labor day and also now starting to do some fundraising for her sending out a message to their supporters to try to get campaign cash in for harris campaign diane in a statement the former president says that harris has more than a resume that she has the vision character and strength that this critical moment demands and this is notable he says she gives us all reason to hope sort of echoing own campaign message from back in talk about passing of the torch there to vice president kamala harris dan at katherine netanyahus meeting with trump comes after his address to congress and meetings with president biden and vice president harris so how will this conversation with trump compare to those conversations well its a good question and i think netanyahu and trump realized that of course there has to be some sort of a good relationship if you will of trump to win the presidency so it will be hard say because we wont be there for the meeting there wont be any coverage of it we will get a statement probably from both parties trump first following that meeting but it will be fascinating because trumps relationship with netanyahu they havent sat down with each other four years of course trump had some animosity towards netanyahu because netanyahu was one of those first world leaders to come out and congratulate joe biden on winning the election and ignore these false claims that trump was making about overturning the election so this is the first time the two men are going to be sitting down in four years well have to say what donald trump and what netanyahu have say afterwards karen harris trump is backpedaling on debating her after the trump campaign said he commit to general election debate details until democrats formally decide on a nominee you talk to radio hosts america every day what are you hearing from them about that day and they want to know if this debate in september on abc is going to happen and what the latest twists and turns are in this because yesterday vice president said shes ready to go lets do this that voters deserve to see split screen in this debate on a debate stage the the former president donald trump had committed to that debate against joe biden and then when this change at the top of the ticket happened he he would still do it in fact he had said maybe more than one debate was reasonable to do and signaled he would do something else fox news had proposed another debate the following week but now the trump campaign signaling that maybe theyre going to not commit to this until perhaps after the democratic national convention katherine harris campaign has been drawing a sharp contrast between the vice president and former president trump but theyre also trying to differentiate her from president shes been more outspoken about ending the war in gaza for example so how tricky is that strategy and how is it working so far well its a bit tricky and i and i think at least for harris and her orbit would say and i think karen knows as well is that i think that they believe that its working well for now it is it is tricky because you hear donald trump saying that kamala harris would just be continuation of joe bidens policies but thats really entirely the case as you mentioned shes been more outspoken on israel and gaza but also on issues like abortion for example so i think even going back to the election before she was running for president she was still outspoken on these issues went a little further than the current administration so while it is a difficult balance it appears at least in democrats would say that it appears that shes successfully doing this well just have to see how the rest of the campaign goes all right karen travers katherine faulders thank you and two leaders of the notorious sinaloa drug cartel are in federal custody the two men including the son of the infamous drug lord el chapo are facing multiple charges for leading the cartels criminal operations attorney general merrick garland made a rare video statement on the arrests the justice department will not rest until every single cartel leader member and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable abc news senior justice producer jack doherty joins me now jack give us some background here who are these two men that were arrested and how long have federal officials investigating them so these two are the top leaders of the sinaloa cartel ismael elmos ambassador hes been at the top of the cartel for years plus and hes considered one of the top people in the organization joaquin guzman lopez the son of the infamous drug lord el chapo whos currently in us and hes one of the four sons of el chapo called and together theyre part of the drug organization that is the attorney general referenced as poisoned american communities across the country the sinaloa cartel operates in all states theyre principally responsible for for the fentanyl crisis in the us theyve mastered the production and smuggling and distribution of that deadly drug across the country to the tune of tens of thousands of american lives every year and its a multibillion dollar business for them its a very big deal the justice department jack what led up to these arrests last night i know the details are still coming out but some of it sounds a scene right out of a movie absolutely its part of an extraordinary operation orchestrated by the fbi agents other us law enforcement like the department of homeland security screening investigations were involved as well but carefully plan to get these men to land a plane in texas but they thought they were landing at a clandestine airstrip in northern mexico and so much al mayos surprise perhaps when he got off the plane he was greeted by agents from the fbi and homeland security investigations so its quite an extraordinary turn to get these men in us custody and basically to fly themselves here all right jack dougherty thank you jack and we

welcome back to abc news live first it is time for me to methods where i usually show you some of my favorite hacks to make life a little easier but today were going to get a little help to work on self confidence and body language with sonya saadat better known on instagram as selfhelp sonia sonia likes to people how to feel more comfortable in your own skin how to stay assertive and interesting conversations and so im so happy to introduce communications expert personal development influencer sonia saadat now for more sonia i follow content and i absolutely love it so im so excited to have you on right now thank you so much for having me im happy to be here my pleasure so you say having good energy and confidence and social settings starts before you even walk in the room so what should we be doing to prepare if that kind of thing doesnt just come naturally to anthony bourdain as an expert at this and something that i think we can take from his book before going into any dinner event what he would do is remind himself of the most interesting things that have happened to him and the reality is that the most interesting people that we talk to dont necessarily have more interesting lives than we do they just keep their most interesting about them top of mind so its important before going into a big social event to think about what are the things that youve learned lately what are the things that youre excited for that are coming up and what are the most interesting things that have recently happened do you keep a log of interesting stories because sometimes you try to think of something and your mind just goes blank so how do you keep them top of mind now i do actually and its something that ive given to many of my followers as well as a tool that they can just keep with them and keep the most whatever their stories are keeping that log and add to it as time goes on and refer back to that before going into a big social event especially if youre like me and you cant often think at the top of your i feel like that could even help you on a daily basis sometimes you get home and husband is like how was your day and i say great but i then cant think of a single meanwhile i know the day was full of eventful things so what about when you get to the event party meeting interview it is what do we need to keep in mind once were there when it comes to body language yeah youre right it all starts with our body language most of our communication actually comes from our nonverbal communication so when we use closed off body language what were doing is sending signals to our brain that we might be in physical danger and that really impacts our mood so were also communicating to others that we feel one of the things that i like to keep in mind when im thinking about body language is just to always have open body and so you keep that means that you keep your your hands away from chest sit up straight and take a dig up as much space as you can i noticed in the video we were just showing you keep your elbows away from your body because sometimes when were uncomfortable we have a tendency to kind of almost curl up like a ball and youre saying hold your elbows out exactly and that has to do with taking up a lot more space it makes you feel more confident when you do it thats so interesting so what about the small talk part of things and what if youre at a party where you dont know anyone and you hate small yeah yeah i think that thats something that ive struggled with as a fellow introvert what i often do is think small talk is great its the foundation of every conversation you cant jump in the deep end and get right into deep talk and talk about meaningful things so you use small talk to pivot into something that is more meaningful for you so it could be something like hey what what did you do this weekend all the weather was great i went skiing oh are you a big fan of skiing is that like how long have you been or and that way you can take the conversation and make it more personable paul and sonia im out of time but for those who are well im an introvert is my thing it doesnt its not comfortable me can you just share a little bit of your story for those people yeah so like like i said a couple of times in this interview im an introvert myself and what that means is that i get i dont get energy from being in loud environments they tend to be very overstimulating for me and so one of the things that i like to do when going into these social events or even interacting with my coworkers is to just think about whats the thing that i can do that would help me get energy from this event so that could be going into a social event and then making one on one meaningful connections out of that and i started to do this its going into social events has completely changed for me and now i actually look forward to them and i teach people how in their life as well i love the idea of having specific to do list goals almost like a scavenger hunt when you walk into the event sort of takes your mind the the having to socialize and the anxiety around it sonya its so great to talk to you thank you so much for having me diane and thank you for streaming with us im diane macedo elbows out the news never stops well be right back first thing in the morning theres a lot going on were still in a flash

saito today on news live first the wildfire emergency on the west coast nearly fires are burning across several states the urgent efforts now under way to contain the planes in the air quality concerns posing a dangerous threat train lines in france targeted by arsonists what authorities are calling a massive coordinated attack ahead of tonights opening ceremony and vice president harris gets a major endorsement with the obamas are now saying about the presumptive democratic nominee what former president trump saying about debating harris and the new focus on jd vances comments women without children plus two notorious drug cartel leaders arrested why federal officials say their for the majority of drugs killing americans including fentanyl but first massive wildfires are burning out of control in the western united more than wildfires are burning right now across california oregon and utah scorching hundreds of thousands of acres and forcing thousands evacuate the park fire alone has already burned more than acres north of sacramento its the largest wildfire californias seen so far this year were going to talk to some victims of these fires coming up but were going to start things with abcs jaclyn lee whos there on the front lines and meteorologist melissa griffin watching the weather for us jacqueline whats it like there in chico and how are people reacting to this park fire thats right dan so we flew in to sacramento which is hours from here and even when you land you see all the plumes of smoke and so i dont know if you can see this but behind me it looks like there is a whole bunch of clouds but thats actually the smoke coming directly from the fire so right now were here at base camp and what is theres a lot of activity going on especially over where theyre feeding firefighters so whats happening is ever since the fire broke out about hours ago those who are part of the initial attack were fighting it for the last hours they are just about to get relief theyre starting to come back were seeing fire crews from all over california weve spoken with firefighters from riverside theres people from ventura county they all drove up and their job is now to relieve those firefighters so the ultimate goal they say is to just contain the fire and were seeing is just this explosive rapid growth that weve seen happen just so quickly which is what makes this fire so stunning its only contained theres more than acres burning and so from the firefighters we spoke with said that theyre just excited to get out there others say they know what expect the biggest problem that theyre dealing with is the environment so not only are you dealing with low humidity youre dealing with very hot temperatures very high temperatures and then of course the wind the wind is whats really dragging this fire out and pushing it pushing around and so we spoke with a firefighter who explained they were actually able to prevent the fire from spreading into the town of paradise they were able to cut it out and move it further north is you know very scary for many residents who obviously with the fire back in which killed more than it killed people so obviously theres a lot of people in this community that dealing with a lot of trauma and so this of course is bringing back some very unpleasant memories but ultimately the main goal is just containing fire diane melissa how bad are these air quality concerns and where is the biggest danger right now is that not only are we seeing these red flag warnings fires being smoke and were seeing very poor air quality especially across the northwest where all those fires are burning lets take a look at chico though thats where we do have the red flag warning in effect thats because we had these southwesterly winds up to mile per hour gusts on top of that low humidity down to today and that he continues for at least one more day there that flag warning stays in effect for the sacramento valley through tonight but those air quality alerts continue look at this canada not only is the smoke coming from all the fires in the us theyre coming from the nearly one that was in active fires in canada and then in the us we have over active large fires across the west youre going see these smoke guys continue right through today you can see all of these red areas kind of just blanketing parts of the interior pacific northwest washington state oregon up through northern california and that smoke will continue to spread through montana into parts of wyoming with a very heavy smoke continuing into the weekend so unhealthy air quality will persist as long as these fires persist diane and melissa firefighters have complained of the heat and wind posing a tough challenge trying to get these fires under control does it look like thats letting up time soon well the good news diane is that the heat is letting up expecting all of the heat advisories excessive heat warnings to expire in the west and were going to be seeing actually potentially below two normal average temperatures for much of the west so the good news is we have that but the problem is its going to heat right back up as we head into the end of july into early august so a brief reprieve but the heat returns all right jaclyn lee melissa griffin thank you both and these fires have scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness but theyre also having a real human impact forcing thousands to evacuate and destroying homes and businesses not only are roscoe and clay of ferguson join me now they lost their home in this fire well as their family owned reptile breeding business i cant imagine what you both are going through right now so first of all im so sorry and thank you for coming on to share your story thank you for having us thank you feeling right now and how did you find out that both your home and your business were gone well it was it was really intense because we managed to get all the animals out and ourselves out but after that the rest of the night was just of like a waiting game we couldnt get any information the house had made it or not thats actually still news reporter that i had spoken to early in the morning befriended me and told me as soon as they knew she let me know and she had sent me pictures of of our home and it was it was gone and theres nothing left oh what went through your mind when you saw those those photos of what was your house and whats left oh it was it was kind of a shock at first you know youve been hearing rumors here and there that the fire had made it to rock creek and the big rattling and i had heard that the vineyard across the street was still standing so you know that gave you a lot of hope that maybe your house was still standing as well and i scrolled through an article online with a vague picture and a description of one of my destroyed structures due to the fire and it was a really small clip but you know your house you know the things that were there and there was a couple by the way by trees that way my wall there was a hat my mom had just given me on a camping trip this summer that was i dropped the way out we were running and it was just on the floor on the driveway and it was there really charred and it was hard to deny that thats your house its its really shocking to find out were just happy at the of the day we were able to get all of our animals out i mean it cost us everything but we got them all out were just were happy we saved to all the lives we could its such a huge bright spot in your story and so where are the animals now kind of support are you getting and how do you plan to move forward this weve had just a huge huge support from our community everybodys rallied together to help we had help during the evacuation even when there was blockades that wouldnt allow people through theres people parked at the blockade down the road ready waiting for us to bring them animals i have i have hundreds of reptiles dispersed throughout like five or six different homes my go my tortoises amazing people are willing to help im getting an influx of calls from customers that had for many years offering to foster and were just going to were going to move through and were going to get through this together as a community and were going to get these animals into safe places temporarily until we can get back on our feet i mean you guys are both just a pillar of strength right now i cant imagine and again im so sorry but im glad that you have this community and youre seeing that support come through noelia rasco clay ferguson in california thank you both thank you so much and speaking of fires france is reporting a massive attack the countrys railway network ahead of tonights olympic ceremony officials arsonists intentionally set fires on three of frances high speed rail overnight trains to the northwest and southwest of paris severely disrupted causing long delays for hundreds of thousands of passengers and stranding hundreds more abc foreign correspondent james longman is in paris with more on that details are pretty scant at the moment but french authorities are calling this a massive and coordinated attack on this countrys railway system three fires were set along rail lines the north and the east of paris it could be that with so much security in place here the capital that these attackers found easier targets elsewhere its caused massive delays and cancellations nearly a million people will have been affected through the weekend fires were set in signal boxes lines

split screen that exists in this on a debate stage and so im ready lets go but trump now backtracking on his pledge to face off on stage his campaign saying it would be inappropriate to schedule things with harris because democrats very well could still change their minds quickly pitting trumps words against him asking what happened to any time any place when the nominee was president joe biden and this morning previous comments from trumps vice presidential candidate jd vance first reported by abc calling for people without children to be taxed more we need to reward the things that we think are good and punish the things that we think are bad so you talk about tax lets tax the things that are bad and not the things that are good if youre making a year and youve got three kids you should pay a different lower tax rate than if youre making the same amount of money and you dont have any kids its that simple the comments resurfaced after a clip of vance questioning the leadership abilities of people without kids was already getting blowback were effectively run in this country via the democrats via our corporate oligarchs buy a bunch of cat ladies who are miserable

leaders of the notorious sinaloa drug cartel are in federal custody the two men including the son of the infamous drug lord el chapo facing multiple charges for leading the cartels criminal operations attorney general merrick garland made a rare video statement on the arrests the justice department will not rest until every single cartel leader member associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable abc news senior justice producer jack datta joins me now jack thanks for coming on can you talk about the background here who two men are and why its such a big deal to now have them custody so these two men are two top leaders of the sinaloa cartel ismael almas and barda he was one of the cofounders and coheads of the sinaloa cartel hes been at it for more than years and the other man that was arrested joaquin guzman lopez hes the son el chapo el chapo was the head of the sinaloa cartel who is currently a us prison these men are indicted in three different districts the united states the sinaloa cartel is responsible for a huge majority of the dominant cartel dealing in fentanyl methamphetamine cocaine and other drugs in the united states and globally theyre responsible really that drug in particular fentanyl responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of americans every year so getting these two men in custody is absolutely significant its a big deal at the justice department they are very excited about the news that these men are in custody and so jack how they actually what actually led up to this arrest how they get them in the country to get them in custody well its were still piecing together details but it looks like something out of a movie these men it appears believed that they were going to northern mexico to inspect a clandestine airstrip either ship landing in texas and they are greeted by the fbi agents from the department of homeland security homeland security investigations and so it was it was an extraordinary turn to be able to get these men to basically fly into the united states and be arrested by us agents so interesting jack that i know youre stay on top of this for us thank you coming up gma lifestyle

straight to you for free thank you for making abc news live americas number one streaming news covering the latest on the immigration front along the southwest border in el paso day of yall wherever the story is well take you there for streaming abc news live hi im diane macedo welcome to abc news live first we want to get straight to our top story massive wildfires are burning out of control in the western united states more than major wildfires are burning right now across california oregon and utah forcing thousands to evacuate the park fire alone already burned more than acres north of sacramento its the largest wildfire california has seen so far this year rick carhart from cal fire is standing by but lets begin with abcs jaclyn lee melissa griffin jaclyn youre at a firefighter base camp in chico whats it like there right now and so diane it is very busy so weve been here all morning long and what weve been seeing is there are fire crews from all over california so right now in the north weve seen crews come up from ventura county from riverside and theyre here just to swap out with the firefighters that have on the front lines for the last hours so what were seeing you might be able to hear it is theres different fire engines coming in and they are doing is these are the guys who are rested so to speak because also been fighting fires throughout the state for the last month or so so what they do is they come here they get all their supplies they get their food ready and then they get their their plans from their supervisor all attack this fire in divisions and some of them will focused on protecting structures others are focused on going to the fire edge of where its burning and then attacking it directly so once they get there their instructions from their supervisor then they go up to the fire they relieve the guys who have been fighting for the last hours those guys can then take a break but then those then have to go back out so then they just start swapping out over hours fire melissa this isnt just about the fires themselves but also the air quality concerns theyre causing whats the latest on that front well diane youre absolutely right because when you have so many of these fires you also get the smoke and thats what brings that poor air quality so let me first off to show you the red flag warnings we have one in effect for the sacramento valley that includes the park fire chico you see there that is in effect through tonight for very low humidity down to and those wind gusts up to miles per hour but you also see the heat continues and we also have red flag warnings stretching into montana and thats due to dry lightning and dry thunderstorms now look at that air quality alerts all of that smoke its not just coming from the fires in the us but also from the fires in canada where nearly active large fires are burning across much of the western part of the country and then you have the active large fires in the west of our country so look at this all of these areas you see in that darker red shade those are coming from the fires from northern california and oregon and washington and that will continue to spread the smoke to parts of the northern rockies yet more unhealthy air quality is expected right into the weekend so were not done with the smoke yet as long as these fires continue to burn diane and melissa firefighters have also complained of heat and wind posing a tough challenge does it look like thats letting up any time soon it is a bit but for only a short amount of time i think now those red flag warnings a lot of them will expire tonight mainly because the winds will die down a bit and also because the heat will be coming to an end much much of the western half of the country will see below average to average temperatures as we head into next week so thatll be a nice break for western us but then you see these much warmer than normal temperatures coming as we head into the end of july and to begin the month of august so the heat not over yet were getting into some of the hottest times of the year diane all jaclyn lee melissa griffin thank you both and i want to bring in rick carhart of cal fire working contain this fire right now rick i know its a really busy time so we really appreciate you coming on can you just give me an update whats the latest youre seeing there well its another day of another major fire in butte county and unfortunately thats been a story really for the last many many years for the last five or six years and so we are you know were wellprepared for this were getting a lot of help we really appreciate so many resources coming in and helping us out from all over the state from from cal fire from also from metropolitan city fire departments and personally going out doing another hour shift today working on containment lines working on protecting structures so that we dont get any more destroyed or damaged homes and you know its its another hot day its another day for firefighters to go out and really work to get control of the fire and the park fire is more than tripled in size in just two days gavin newsom the governor has announced a fema grant to boost containment efforts how do you expect that to help efforts on the ground and how unusual is it to see a fire grow this quickly well yeah this fire has absolutely just exploded and it keeps doing i mean it went from you know just a few acres from acres to to to and then it was and now its and almost so yeah this fire is it really is sort of perpetuating itself weve got these what what youll see here in the north in the afternoon is youll see this giant cumulus cloud its actually cairo cumulus cloud its the fire creating its own weather pattern and so that just you know it just allows itself to grow and continue to grow and you know and do things that remain unpredictable and so were getting more resources then were getting more boots on the ground were getting more aircraft in the air and were going to you know as soon as we get them out on the line theyre going to theyre going to get to work and theyre going to get the same thing and rick we just heard our meteorologist saying that you are expected to get a break from the heat for a little while least but then more heat behind it whats your reaction to that well my reaction is just being very grateful im so much looking forward to a day when it barely hits and you know were all talking about putting our sweaters on for the its just been so hot we get you know it gets degrees for good sections of the year seems like every july and august we have a number of days in doesnt usually get more than degrees in this area for multiple days a row and thats what weve had for about the last three weeks which you know thats of the reasons the fires grown so much and grown so big is because everything is so dry because of the heat and humidity all right rick carhart i know its a busy time we appreciate you coming on thank you and good luck thank you maam and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has arrived in florida ahead his meeting with former president trump at mar a lago it comes after netanyahus address to congress and meetings with both president biden and vice president harris abc news white house correspondent karen travers joins me now for on all of that so karen how will this conversation with trump maralago compared to those meetings netanyahu had with biden and vice president harris you know theyll be talking about similar issues of course about the us and israeli relationship but donald is not the president so when prime minister netanyahu was here at the white house yesterday the president and him were talking about the to get that cease fire deal and to try to get that region across the finish line and secure the release of the remaining hostages netanyahu also sat down with vice president harris for a conversation along those same lines and diane senior officials at the white house say that they do believe theyre close to getting that deal that they are at the point where they think that the final details reachable but weve also been at this point before where they felt that they were closed and then things fell apart for the last couple of weeks they have been sort of stuck in a stalemate theyre trying to get this now the finish line also notable yesterday that the president and the prime minister with some of the families of the americans held hostage by hamas this meeting down there at mar a lago though between the former president donald trump and the prime minister thats really a significant effort by netanyahu who almost to hedge his bets as to who will be here in the white come january now the harris campaign has been drawing a sharp contrast between the vice president and former president trump but theyre also trying it seems at least to differentiate from president biden shes been more outspoken about civilian in gaza for example what do you make of that strategy you know she is of course part of the bidenharris administration so theyll say that her policies on this very critical foreign are the same as the presidents and that includes reaching the cease fire deal and securing the release of the remaining hostages but it has been notable to see the vice president go a bit further than what weve seen from president biden talking about her concern about the civilian casualties in gaza the need for more humanitarian and signaling that perhaps she could take a tougher stance israel and what they should be doing certainly she said yesterday it was a frank and constructive conversation with netanyahu and that she pushed him on all of those things all right karen traverse thk you and we have breaking news right now attorney ben crump and the family of sonia the woman shot and killed by a police officer after calling them for help earlier this month the family is now speaking out for the first time since that shooting lets listen talk about update as we continue to probe and find out all the reasons why this tragedy happened leading up for the killing the killing and the aftermath of the killing we talked how the family wanted a thorough investigation as to why they didnt know until hours later that the person who had shot saw you masi was a alive official why were they told from the very beginning when they showed up asking who did this malachi talked about how he was on the phone with the hospital officials and he kept they kept saying somebody shot her in her face and told him in graphic detail at in the morning what happened to his mother but never told them who should be here and went to the house at am that morning when law enforcement all around they kept asking the questions who did this what happened nobody told them that it was the sheriffs deputy sean grayson who had shot her in the face they seemed to be being led to believe that it was some prowler or something because they started asking questions every time they would ask questions they would be given questions what was the history between her and the neighbor and so it was troubling and so we were invested gation and i say we the family personally wanted an investigation into that they are because they are suspicious of everybody and everything would be if this happened to your daughter your mother and then we thought with the department of justice they cause we want to know more about the history of this sheriff who so flagrantly says lesley shot and killed sonya massey with no remorse no humanity after did it evidenced by the video people contacted our office since weve had the press conferences teresa and this is why we continue to to fight not only in the court of law but in the court of public opinion because we know we have to fight to get justice we dont as soon that is just going to happen for black people in america even when we got all the evidence in the world all the visual evidence in the world we still dont take it for granted we know the lessons of laquan mcdonald and how it got slap on the wrist even though that evidence was on video ocular proof of the crime and we have been made aware of that there were some unsubstantiated of excessive force by officer allegedly on two occasions one da dealt with an african american who received injuries from a taser but regrettably before the findings were conclu did the individual cooperate because apparently he was dead on with the criminal charges and so he apparently didnt trust the system to do right by him so we know that individual is not considered coming forward even though you have to understand a of people a lot of minorities in america dont come forward for many reasons they dont call the police for reasons because things normally dont turn out good for us when we call the police obviously so mass is exhibit one but we hope and encouraging him to come forward and tell what happened and well deputy sean grayson and the other individual we know that we dont know what this situation is but apparently they also complained about excessive unnecessary force inflicted by the deputy and the question really goes back to where sonyas father mr wilburn saying well that to do his with the reprimand from the army over serious misconduct where the six different law enforcement agencies is and four years where whatever answers he answered in the questionnaires when he was interviewing for the job went you asked about why did you leave this department why did you resign this were there red flags missed and said he had a bad hired in the first place by the sheriffs department then those questions only get louder you know malachi and cliff jones and as we ask that question you know do ask guilty convictions how do you even have a drivers license much less get the job as a sheriffs deputy many questions to be answered and so we will instead in the form letter to the department of justice with those things that we have been made aware of and they have promised the family that they will work with the local agencies and they will try to get answers to all these allegations of all the instances of excessive force and before you hear from uncle massey and she did a massive family for malachi massey we want to take a few minutes to go over the autopsy report because i think its important and to reach out to you work to kind of and you all i want to thank state attorney john mira houser for making sure he got autopsy to the family for transparency and that hes provided it to you all even though the family takes great exception the sheriffs department they have been very grateful that mr mayor has his office has tried to be very transparent and very respectful to them as victims and so he made sure that this autopsy report was released and is a model that has lot of the questions that you are asked previously the biggest thing on the autopsy departments and we will go to now is the conclusion is based on the information available youre listening to attorney ben crump who is representing the family of sonya massey speaking out against the shooting death by police former deputy sean grayson is charged with her murder after shooting massey in the face in her kitchen claiming she was coming at him with a pot of boiling water now crump says the family know until hours later that the person who shot massey was a law enforcement official hes also raising questions about whether grayson should been hired in the first place i want to bring in former nypd chief of detectives robert boyce robert were waiting to see if we hear from masseys family directly but in the meantime i wanted get your reaction to these remarks from ben crump even before that your reaction to the details of what we know in this case so far what do you think when you look at that video when you hear the claims from sean gration when you hear prosecutors saying he had enough distance and cover from where he was to not have to use fatal force you know when you look at this and its something comes quickly for you in law enforcement you have training and experience you can make that change so they go there thinking this a burglary and they soon find out its not that at this this is having some problems concentrating and speaking and also communicating so you really transmit it usually to someone who needs it perhaps some psychological help or just confused however the tactics this is so bad at so many levels you emasculate it put out a take on boiling water when you actually could be a problem you and you literally with his pipes and other instruments as well that goes against the training youve ever seen ive seen in law enforcement it just you know she has the positive and she advances maybe a step and makes that statement yet you in an empty space took that as a threat to be treated as well but then something really probably the most egregious thing ive seen he actually use is water instead of dirt and again thats thats thats something in training that you know you cant he will never teach you never even do it step back and begin to escalate and put it down man and forth so theres so many problems with this its its really outrageous and it looks like theyre looking at the results of the autopsy report that just came out robert they found that she died of a gunshot wound to the head they the coroner ruled it a homicide i dont think a huge surprise there on either front but to hear ben crump now say that the family didnt find out until hours later that it was a sheriffs deputy who shot her are you surprised to hear that i am somewhat theres the detectives go over tell the family immediately to make notification let them know what happened immediately that should have happened in this age of transparency they kind of knew right away by looking at the they body worn cameras which is a such an advancement and obviously i understand that justice immediately what happened we dont have to wait we really want to see it in real time so you is made news of what happened and you should have reached out to the family quicker than that just a little of it is quite a is quite a long time to really let them know whats going and robert a lot of questions are now being raised about sean history and whether he should have been hired to begin with among things that he worked for six agencies in just a span of four a discharge talk to me a bit about and do you think that the department could be liable for putting him in that position to begin with well i think whats under review right now the hiring practices and policies and is evolving its policies and this is all part of the george floyd act to we follow these law offices around national discretion where theyre going about theyre doing some of that is explainable he was a part time in three of those agencies and he kept going leapfrogging each one you know to a full time spot somewhat explainable in that sense however he released that he had and he gets hired in that first place by so thats unusual usually that would qualify to qualify you one of the family it will definitely disqualify you so these are things that you take a look at you look at his his service as well you see whats in that but training diane is is the issue here in training with someone whos out because with law enforcement right now continues given all is getting better and with a horrible setback is dealing with the mentally ill or someone is in an episode and this is what the problem here its not picking the tips and we heard a im sorry we heard crump mentioned red flags and youre saying his his history across various agencies could have been that his discharge from the army abc news is learning he was discharged for whats called serious misconduct does it surprise to have a sheriffs department hire someone like that in this position well again its case by case its only a couple but i see the words serious misconduct thats disqualifier as well so theres three men that were disqualified sean grayson from the police service and there he is six agencies so thats this is really unusual and this is what we want national standards for so we can see that you know coming down the road a little bit that maybe he shouldnt be there he was an aggressive you saw that this was a small wound by herself on this never should have happened this should have been handled she never should have gotten off that couch it should not have been handled very easily again this it was after midnight so i dont know his level of confusion out there but this is a problem that youre in anywhere in law and law enforcement we want to stop this from happening we just need to do that is a very strong foreign policy all right robert boyce we appreciate your analysis as always thank you and we will continue to follow this story across all on abc news the news never stops and neither do we well be right back whenever news breaks we are here in israel a nation at war after that brutal surprise attack by hamas on the ground in ukraine reporting from lewiston maine scene of a horrific mass shooting abc news live is right there everywhere from the scene of that deadly missile strike continue to bring you reporting from the earthquake in turkey in rolling forth this tornado tore through this little town from the most devastating disaster in hawaii from charleston south carolina on the campaign trail in iceland lets go traveling the president in mexico city wherever the story is on the front lines from southern israel outside the gaza strip in beirut the fbi reporting the nurses on the picket line here at ten downing street in london streaming live to you forever the story is wherever the story is wherever the story is were going to take you there abc live were streaming abc news live abc news live streaming free everywhere americas number one streaming news welcome back to abc news live first to leaders of the notorious sinaloa drug cartel are in federal custody two men including the son of the infamous drug lord el chapo are facing multiple charges for leading cartels criminal operations abc news senior justice producer jack joins me now for more jack you know its a big deal when the attorney general hosted a video conference just to announce an arrest so how significant is this and why its extraordinarily significant these are two of the top leaders of the sinaloa cartel the sinaloa cartel is responsible for putting an enormous amount of the deadly fentanyl on us streets they they operate in all states the united states that drug is responsible for the of tens of thousands of americans each year so getting two of its top leaders is a very big deal ismael el mayos and joaquin guzman lopez as you mentioned is a son of the infamous drug lord el chapo guzman so big deal it like el mayo had his initial appearance in court today this morning in el paso entered a plea to enter a plea of not guilty and hes expected to for an arraignment next next week on the st on wednesday for a detention hearing an and so well be watching him back in court again at that and jack what are you watching for as this case moves forward well the key is going to be what happens to joaquin guzman lopez he was with mayo when they landed in texas and it all appears to be part of a ruse that was set up by the fbi and other investigative agencies to lure them into the united states it appears that they may have thought they were landing at a remote clandestine airstrip north mexico when in fact they landed in texas and they were met by agents from the fbi and homeland security investigations who took them into custody so what happens to him and to see if he was perhaps treated the same way as amaya will be an interesting development to watch for sure well jack thank you and now we want to go back now to that breaking news the family of sonia massey a woman shot and killed by a police officer while holding a pot of boiling water theyre now speaking lets listen to see my family hurt and after what attorney crump talked about the autopsy that is exactly why he needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law that man that thank you thank you very much now you will hear from city of massey who is her first cousin raymonds daughter and even she has three other sisters she was raised where she did and they were like sisters and should deal with the first family member to arrive at the scene and i mean obviously the emotional seeing your sister blood everywhere how she tried to claim the murder so malachi are some of her children went out to see that that blur when they came in the house to get their clothes so should we imagine were trying to speak to you from the heart you should be hello no i am at the to me i left her so much this tragedy has been so much on my family her kids her daughter cannot sleep in my job shes in one household im in another household for her to go to the bathroom she to be on face time with me for her to get a drink of water she has to call us before she get out of here now this is the hardest thing that we have ever been through martha it just breaks my heart that our family has to go through this to you know not keep justice for sandra the you hear from malachi who was the first one notified that his mother had been killed and just as he explained it to us when told him you see with your families at all times so you know the current youre hearing your heart well you know that they told me that my mom she i sign or i came out of that and i dont know like i havent been able to sleep now the only time i really feel comfortable sleeping is when like when im like this on the floor i cant even sleep in my bed i dont know if like this is this oh i dont i really dont have words like i said i dont have words to use but the first night i dont go to my mothers house this happens half my life and i wonder if i was if he would have did anything to me i dont know really some of the same she lives with her father i live with my father and i will say this up until just a few weeks malachi and summer were staying with their mother she was having milk in the cells and they made the decision it was best and i think thats probably why she seeks help and where both of them were going every day to check on their mother and brother and the first time i talked to another guy he was so distraught because he said because i work and this is the first day i didnt get to her and this happens and then the only other i want to tell them is you think law enforcement came early that okay it was it was an incident that happened earlier that day and i told to two officers or whatever and i believe that its the same officer that saw my mother i talked to his partner first and the second officer thats the one that i think the one that did that i talked to them and they told me that because she was driving herself to the hospital or something she wasnt even at the house when this was going on she was driving to the hospital and they told me that they were going to go there to help her and then this happens so she was sick in here because was trying to get help and its like mister we are burning here she was trying to get help she needed a helping hand not a bullet to the face right she just needed those officers to extend hours of humanity not to kill her and it was a mutual here on this is real you all may have family members who are struggling with their mental health they they deserve more compassion and consideration not excessive and justified force like we saw on that video so we continue to try to say that sonya massey life matters she the man when you hear america talk about work mothers she worked hard she worked overtime to get car and everything so he can get a she talked to him about balancing budgets and about the bible and about trying to work and be responsible i mean she was doing her best to be a person who helped people in the world especially her children she did not deserve this she did not deserve this so if you you got to get your okay oh thank you so much malachi we will try to take some of your questions if you have so im sorry malachi describing earlier you are clear that there was a response that he had to attorney ben crump and the family of sonya massey including her son speaking out against her shooting death by police former deputy sean grayson is charged with her murder after shooting massey in the face in her kitchen claiming she was coming at him with a pot of boiling water now crump is raising questions about whether grayson should have been hired in the first place and we heard massey son there raising questions another encounter with police earlier that day i want to bring in former chief of detectives robert boyce robert whats your reaction to hearing from stone your masseys family here not only on the impact of this death on the family but not her son saying he believes there was an encounter with police earlier that day when they were trying to help her get to the hospital or she was trying to drive herself to the hospital and he says he believes he spoke with deputy grayson in that encounter as well just a diane that will be investigated whether that didnt happen at this point im looking at this thinking due to police shift work that might not have happened to make himself confused with someone else i cant say for sure they dont know i dont want to speculate if she called for help at some time generally speaking in modern police departments you have a radio and immediately the dispatcher will tell you when the last time you were there will have to be looked at to see if this this woman has that ability to until you let you know immediately that that person had some kind of distress and that youre going back into it maybe you can mitigate that maybe you know before you go in so we were trying to find out whats in the minds of the officers when they walked through that door with the sheriffs deputies sort of thinking what information they in their head and why they acted the way they acted one acted anyway the way they acted so thats all part of the investigation that will come out its a strong point and i have no doubt he did despite the officers is now well aware and who they were what he told them but again modern police departments have the ability to tell what was happening at the scene about the last video around their last couple where everyones there at that location and robert on that point were hearing ben crump and the family say that her children were living with their fathers while she was seeking help for mental illness her son says he was checking on her still on a daily and this was the one day that he didnt because he was working but to know she had a history of mental illness she was trying to seek help what kind of information do you expect the deputies to your point to have before they even walk in the and does that change the approach when you do walk into house in a case like that it does but heres the interesting thing with that diane they did it they didnt want to go running down on lead that possible burglar was there was you look at a broken window or open door or something like that then they knocked on the door from where im standing remember the video is a video fairly long on the body worn camera so a lot of goes on in that tactics inside and such they realized she having trouble cognitive trouble because she couldnt remember her last name and the one sean grayson is the one who was the primary interview at that point clearly dont in any fashion in your situation there is

human transplant doctors removed the bottom half of his heart and completely replaced it with this artificial device the surgery took place earlier this month as part of the fdas early feasibility study now the device is made of titanium and it pumps blood and replaces both ventricles of a failing heart experts say is durable its resistant to wear and reliable as a temporary heart replacement

reshef thank you and now its time for our weekly segment patel it like it is where abc news contributor shares some health advice on the topics that matter most to you and today hes answering some of your questions so dr patel were going get straight into it with an anonymous viewer question this viewer wants to know how does diet and nutrition affect adhd symptoms management and treatment and i promise i am not the anonymous viewer but i am very curious about the answer here diane you may not the anonymous viewer but i get asked this question all the time because nutritional approaches to adhd management is a growing topic theres a lot of research here and now right now there is no official dietary protocol but research has shown that healthy balanced diet improve symptoms in individuals who have adhd and the opposite diets that are high in processed foods worsen symptoms now is because our bodies function better when were eating nutritious foods is it because of a specific deficiency in nutrients such as vitamin d magnesium or iron one really knows but it is important to note that youre not doing this and i really respect anyone out there whos trying to take their familys medical conditions especially conditions such as adhd into their own hands and looking at symptomatic management such as with a diet just make sure you talk to a health care practitioner about this and also diane kudos you about amplifying this conversation and normalizing it so people there including all the anonymous ones feel empowered to go and ask these questions to take control thank you friend i never would have gotten diagnosed if other people hadnt shared their stories and made me realize hey wait that sounds like me so just my attempt to pay it forward to anyone who i can help my story and great advice on that dr patel i be you with more questions but right now i want to get to lillians question from san francisco lillian wants to know what daily vitamins supplements to you suggest for toddlers lets on the nutrition train so generally speaking if toddlers are eating a healthy balanced diet i know thats asking a lot because you know how they are they dont actually need any supplementation now there are certain indications such as chronic illnesses restrictive diets delays in growth or specific vitamin deficiencies where a doctor may recommend supplementation such as vitamin d toddler should be taking about ius or international units per day you cant get that with diet sometimes its easier to take a multivitamin depending on the indication and time with restrictive diets some kids may not get enough nutrients such as iron b or zinc so it is important youre having a conversation with your doctor at all if youre concerned about the vitamins and minerals your toddler needs and i just want to make the psa and say that if you go to the store and you see those supplements that say things like supports bone growth improves the immune system helps your toddler grow up to go to an ivy league school a lot of that is marketing terms know what youre getting and what youre buying and talk to a health care professional how about helps your toddler pay attention you when you talk to them wheres that vitamin you know thats thats the vitamin called patience dedicated care dr alok patel always great to have you thank you friend thank you and if you have questions for dr patel leave him a message on our instagram feed to my answer your question right here on friday and billy joel is moving out of madison square garden the piano man

back to abc news live opening ceremony the olympic games will look a little different than in years past rather than a parade of athletes entering a stadium the french have given it twist with athletes parading down one of the most famous rivers in the world but there is another surprise everyones hoping to see tonight rumors are swirling about celine dion and lady gaga performing together abcs lara spencer has more all by hours to go the olympics opening ceremony reports that superstar celine dion wont be all by herself performing on stage i wanna hold them like they do and take this place instead word is shell be teaming up with lady gaga for the ultimate duet on the superstars keeping a poker face if you will about the claims sparking a fan frenzy as theyre spotted taking paris by storm and a gaga enjoying the restaurant where it multiple outlets claiming the two superstars will sing the french la vie en rose also a song gaga belted out in a star is born french president emmanuel macron coy about dionnes appearance saying only it would be great news and i would be immensely happy if she could be at this opening ceremony the chance to perform at the olympics monumental and makes for an incredible comeback well youll the spice girls reunited for londons closing ceremony if celine does take the stage it would mark her first live performance since announcing her diagnosis with stiff syndrome in and would be nearly years since she brought down the house at the atlanta olympics in singing the power of the dream and lara spencer and join me now with more lara what are people there saying about this possibility of celine dion performing tonight which would be her first performance since revealing her diagnosis stiff person syndrome a big comeback would be a stage for a comeback celine dion of course knows how to sort of set the stage she does everything big she also like all of the here knows about resilience right and this would be such an incredible place for her to make the comeback because lets face it she might be from montreal but the french think that she belongs to them before before celine became so near and dear to all of our hearts she was a huge star with a lot of french hats and we have been told by many french people that it would be so poignant if she did in fact make her return to the stage right here at the opening game at the opening of the games sure would be james you were at the tokyo olympics those games had been postponed due to the pandemic so how different are these games already from what you saw in tokyo yeah diane i mean those tokyo games were really strange i mean covid meant that there could be no spectators no was there so it was a really strange games obviously thats completely different in paris not to put too much of a dampener on it weve had a great time so far but so far the security situation here in paris makes it feel like its almost covid because no one is allowed to be anywhere on these streets you might hear in the background that theres a police down there with a loudspeaker telling people to get off the street the security situation is intense didnt feel that way in tokyo but tonight will be special i mean for the first time ever an opening ceremony with flotilla down the side i mean that is going to be amazing were looking forward to it i also dont you guys having snazzy matching jackets in tokyo can i can we just show you please i mean please keep your hands around the back thats so good yeah ive been spending too much time together you literally moved identically on the beat without even a cue lara weve weve these sports have been amazing weve really enjoyed them you can tell honestly it shows in coverage and lara one of my favorite parts has been watching you both action testing some of these sports ahead of the game so what event are most excited for honestly i had never of kayak cross and maybe you havent either because its never been an olympic sport it is at this games for the first time and its insane i mean its basically motocross shows on the water and it starts by getting flung off of a platform and then and then the boaters or like hitting each other james and i were just trying to stay afloat when when we succeed no no it was sad it was sad but i cannot wait to see that and great britain has the medalists the whos going to get the gold

on james longman hes actually very good were slightly competitive and i would say that he definitely was better than me in the table tennis but we are both equally in love with amy wang who is competing tonight i believe in her opening shes in vanuatu yes exactly which which ill be honest with you lara had a little bit of a problem recognizing that as a nation but yes i did we we established that vanuatu is in fact a country competing at these games and amy will be playing yes that that so were really excited see that and then i dont know if you know this but i was a diver penn state university the captain of the diving team so i will be rooting for the americans and i know you love daly oh yeah tom yeah but also team usa oh no and now youre seeing there is artistic

wherever the story is well take you there youre streaming abc news live and right now on abc news live massive exploding on the west coast with nearly separate fires burning across multiple states were live on the scene as work to put out the flames plus two of the biggest cartel leaders in mexico arrested in a dramatic operation straight out of a hollywood movie who they are and what it means the surge in fentanyl pouring into the us and barack and michelle out with an endorsement of vice president kamala harris presidential run but the race stands now and how soon we might see the obamas out there on the campaign trail hi everyone im trevor ault our top story at this hour those massive wildfires burning out of control in the west more than wildfires are burning across california oregon and utah torching hundreds of thousands of acres and forcing thousands of evacuations the park fire in northern california alone has burned than acres its the states biggest wildfire of year authorities say this was arson and the suspect is under arrest our jaclyn lee joins us now from chico california about miles north of sacramento so jacqueline whats the latest on this park fire and much of it is contained right now well travel right now is contained so we just spoke with the public information officer from cal fire and he told me just a few seconds ago that you know initially they were saying it was contained when it was only acres but now given how much this fire has exploded with more than acres burning he said theyre starting over its contained this fire is just evolving so rapidly its growing so much and they have so resources now that are throwing out it just trying to get it under control trevor all those resources jacqueline whats the weather doing to help or hurt this so the biggest issue that we have is it is very hot up here and theres also a lot of wind so were here at base camp and whats going on right now is you can see different trucks you could probably hear it as well there are fire crews from all over the state that are coming up to help and so we just spoke with the fire chief from fresno he just got back from working a hour shift up on the front lines he said it is just a wall of fire up there it is very difficult for the guys up there because not only are they battling exhaustion theyre battling to keep but its also concerning because theyre trying to you know protect the structures theyre working with residents trying to get them either to evacuate or to just stay safe overall in general so now were seeing different fire crews coming back working some even hours in a row theyre getting food theyre getting supplies theyre getting rest and theyre going right back out trevor into all those trucks mobilizing behind you jacqueline of course you have all this fire youre going to have smoke to has the air quality so right here where we are were at the at the base camp its not as bad as it would be obviously up where the fire is burning i dont know if you can see this but right now it looks like theres a lot of clouds thats not thats actually smoke plumes and what whats happening is because this fire is growing so large its creating its own weather pattern within which for example that could mean it is creating windy conditions right where the fire is whereas other areas might not see that so of course thats a very dangerous but of course officials are warning everyone where your respirators you really never know how these particles can affect your lungs trevor of course even with all this massive resources and effort its going to take quite some time given all these factors to get the fire out jaclyn lee forest jacqui thank you i had to politics now is the israeli prime minister hedging his bets when it comes to the presidential election benjamin is now visiting former president donald trump at maralago well this trip to florida comes just one day after netanyahu met separately with vice president kamala harris and president biden in washington meantime the vice president is picking up a high profile endorsement from the obamas in a video released this morning take a listen we call to say michelle and i couldnt be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the oval office of course the vice president on a video call harkening back to we did it joe in that famous video senior reporter katherine faulders white house correspondent maryalice parks george both join me now catherine well start with you so we have this meeting now trump and netanyahu what are they to achieve with todays meeting and how does it compare to the meetings you had with biden and yesterday yeah and our reporters were brought into this meeting last minute so were still trying to figure out exactly what was said in that meeting but the reality this is that this is the first time that trump and netanyahu have sat down in four years you recall about four years ago when netanyahu was one of the first leaders to congratulate president joe biden on his victory trump took offense to that because netanyahu wasnt buying into the fraud claims if you will so this is the first time that they have sat down in four years it will be interesting to hear ultimately what was said in that meeting he was asked trump was asked about his relationship with netanyahu he said theyve always had a good relationship so well just have to see ultimately what comes out of this meeting but it appears from that video they were sitting down having some sort of meal i would assume lunch yeah and definitely an opportunity for trump to mark himself as diametrically opposed biden or harris at least in terms of some of their approaches towards israel maryalice not really a surprise that the obamas are endorsing the vice president here but what does their endorsement actually mean for yeah no big surprise that we were expecting this of course as weve other democratic leaders really rally to her new candidacy the party moving forward shes now the presumptive nominee having secured enough delegates even though none have officially voted yet but look this means a lot because no one is more popular in the democratic party and are just such prolific fundraisers so if we see president obama michelle obama out there on the campaign trail it will make a huge difference and weve seen just this incredible momentum around harris new around her new campaign she honestly hasnt had a hard time raising money on her own so far but the question really now is does that sort of honeymoon phase end or is she able to just build on this momentum going forward i think its a part of the reason that we actually saw it a few days between when some of the other big endorsements came out and this one i think that democrats are sort of trying to let this look like it was a bit more organic and theyre trying to sort of keep that momentum up someone like former president obama who is such a sort of an old statesman in the party didnt want to make it appear as as if he had just sort of handpicked her but but well see if it actually sort of manifests itself into campaigning for her beyond just that video and first endorsement deborah catherine it does seem like might not see the vice president on the debate stage with former president trump hes casting some doubt on that is this gamesmanship or do you think theres actually a chance we wont see these two candidates debate look its hard to tell with the former president of course all we know right now is that he agreed to the debate now the line is from the campaign and from trump that because theres no vice presidential candidate they dont have anybody officially the ticket for example that he is just going to wait and see what happens look well just have to wait and see with trump all we know is that he agreed and now he seems to be wavering a little bit but its its we just we just cant tell at this point trevor and he kind of holds all the cards in terms of whether he decides to it or not maryalice of course the vice president now has to decide her potential vice president where do we stand on that search were told from the campaign is they are still casting a wide net that they are looking at nearly a dozen vice presidents and that they are running mates i should say and they are still in the vetting process i mean some of these senators and you think of them as having a high profile of of being on the national stage but it is still different to have a team here actually look through absolutely everything that theyve ever said and trying to do that vetting thats normally a months long process in a matter of days so this is tough it is all hands on deck they know this is sort of the first major decision that she is going to make and could be the most consequential decision she makes for her campaign and a lot of these like you said theyre coming from battleground states so of course theres this theres a strategy here right to someone like mark kelly a senator from arizona actually put arizona four more in play wood josh shapiro the governor of pennsylvania on the ticket really lock up pennsylvania for democrats to know but of course they are weighing those factors as well as sort of these candidates past past statements policy positions and how they sort of jive with with kamala harris maryalice parks for us at the white house and katherine faulders thank you both meantime today federal are handling the arrest of two top leaders of the notorious mexican sinaloa drug cartel it smells and body garcia also as el myo and joaquin guzman lopez the son infamous drug lord el chapo they are both now behind bars here the us after they were taken into custody in el paso texas now attorney general merrick garland says the cartel is one of the most violent and powerful cartels in the world responsible for shipping thousands of of cocaine methamphetamine and fentanyl into the us every day el mayo already appeared in federal court today in el paso pleading not guilty we want to bring in abc news senior justice and homeland reporter jack doherty here for more jack very interesting story so we know a homeland security official tells abc news that this was an operation that had been planned for months what do you know about how it unfolded well it was it was done under the cloak of secrecy an extremely sensitive operation to get these two top leaders of the cartel into the united states in it was extraordinary that you know ismael mayo zubaydah is hes been a leader of the cartel for nearly years plus years really and joaquin guzman is the son of el chapo one of his four sons who also form part of the leadership of the powerful sinaloa cartel theyre responsible for enormous amounts of in this country tens of thousands of people die every year due to fentanyl overdoses theyre the chief importer and producer of this type of fentanyl also methamphetamine also cocaine and its a multitiered multilayered multibillion dollar business we have learned that even mexican officials jack didnt know this was happening until after arrests occurred what makes you think the fbi wanted to have these arrests place on us soil rather than extradite them from mexico well its a huge advantage to have them arrested in the us because theyre facing charges in several districts in the united states and be able to sort of shortcut the entire extradition process takes years out of the process because that get tied up in mexican courts for quite some time the security of the operation also can be kept intact by having it be a us operation mexican authorities have not acknowledged that is a big breakthrough in the fight against the cartels but it did in fact take them by surprise that they were able to lure these two leaders of the sinaloa cartel into united states so el milo had his initial appearance this morning in el paso federal court we know hes faced some charges in a number of jurisdictions over the years do those come into play now that hes under arrest absolutely its an opportunity to bring him finally to justice some of these charges have been pending for well over ten years and he pleaded not guilty in court today but he is likely to face detention pending trial and well see which charges they eventually go with in terms of his upcoming trials and as far as mr guzman he hasnt appeared yet but were waiting to see which charges he will initially face in the united states so attorney general merrick garland says the department of justice will not rest every single cartel leader member and associate responsible for in our communities is held accountable now these big arrests but these are two men where does the doj go from here exactly its a massive business enterprise with a huge infrastructure the cartel is able to operate effectively all states in the united states dealing drugs at every level in the united states and so trying to uproot the organization they can start at the top but boy they have to dig much down to really have an impact in terms of stopping the flow of drugs the united states because some other leaders will step up in their place theres a lot of money to be made and theres plenty of incentive to continue to push drugs in the united states and the demand remains extraordinarily high here so still a lot of work to be done but definitely some major arrests jack that day for us jack thank you very much and coming up here on abc news live the latest on coordinated arson attacks train lines in france just hours before the olympic opening how many travelers are still stranded thats coming up whenever breaks we are here in israel a nation at after that brutal surprise attack by hamas on the ground in ukraine reporting from lewiston maine the scene of a horrific mass shooting abc news is right there every from the scene of that deadly missile strike in ukraine ukraine reporting from the earthquake turkey in rolling forth this tornado tore through this little town from the most devastating disaster in hawaii from charleston south on

news live abc news live youre streaming abc news live abc news live streaming everywhere americas number one streaming news if were coming of age in the s the brad pack was near the center your cultural awareness but for those of us experiencing it from the inside the brad pack was something very different that critics agree hated the brad pack what a disaster why we take it as an offensive as you can see details well it was still shea stadium i think could have had first thing in the morning theres a lot going on were still in a flash flood warning to catch you up with what happened overnight police in riot gear arresting dozens of protesters whats happening today escalating tensions in the middle what people are talking about the migrant crisis fast straightforward but some fun in between check out the gator on the pulled a buzz kill and baseball first thing in the morning america this morning americas number early morning news on abc news live thank you for streaming with us just hours before the opening ceremony of the olympics in paris french authorities say there was a massive coordinated attack on countrys high speed train lines fires were set along three lines cables were cut and this attack delayed trains at nearly every major station in paris it impacted at least people with those delays also affecting a separate train which connects the uk to france i want to dig in on this with more we have abcs and as liquid terror force in paris so and as lets just start with where you are right now there in paris you have the olympics starting i imagine security is very tight what are you seeing what are french officials saying i mean trevor yes we are just a few feet from where the opening ceremony is just about to get underway just a few feet from the said river which actually just down that street right there and you can see this police checkpoint behind me the streets have been closed to traffic for the most part theres clearly some cars still getting in out but its been very restricted and theres nowhere you can go in paris really without running into some kind of security presence law enforcement presence more than police officers have been deployed just for the opening ceremony an additional thousand members of the military there have also been members of other law enforcement forces from from countries around the world that have been sent in to lend a hand the over paris is closed as well so no flights getting in and out of paris nothing flying over paris right now to try and keep the opening as safe as possible you can imagine the challenge that this poses theyre trying to hold this outdoor as know this is the first time ever that the opening ceremony is going to be held outside of a stadium so security measures have been really ramped up to try and keep everything going smoothly and even with all that security as we still have this attack on the train lines whats the latest from officials there and how long do we think it could take to get it all repaired yeah really alarming development there so french officials saying that there there was this massive coordinated attack on the french railway fires set at a number of railway stations around the country they say that they believe this was deliberately done to destabilize the olympics and that high speed rail lines were specifically and like you mentioned at the top there the train from the uk the eurostar was also affected so over passengers have been impacted all of these people trying to get to the opening ceremony trying to get to paris in time for the beginning of the games we understand initially we were told that it would take until monday for to resume normally we understand as of just a few moments ago officials did say that things were improving theyve been working on it all day and so we are to start seeing some significant improvements starting tomorrow and notable they call this arson but theyre not calling it terrorism at least so far and as look for terror thank you very much reporting for us in paris meantime an official autopsy report today confirmed back here at home that the death of sonia massy was indeed a homicide yearold black woman died of a gunshot wound to the head after she was shot by police inside her own apartment officials say the mother of two called herself to report a suspicious person before things escalated we want to warn you this video may be difficult to watch for us what youre seeing in water away from us in the water enable afternoon you and i know how to create a safe cross shot fired shot fired shots are very difficult to watch so the police department did quickly fire that officer who pulled the trigger deputy sean grayson he was then indicted for first degree murder and aggravated battery today the is calling for more accountability and justice for sonia masi they told me that theyre going to go there to help her and then this happens here so she was seeking help she needed a helping hand not a bullet to the face so we want to bring in abc news contributor and former nypd chief of detectives robert boyce robert so much for being here your reaction number one to how this happened also the immediate response from police with the firing and even an apology the department good to be with you trevor so you look at this thing almost immediately by body worn camera they know what happened so it takes us back to july th hes indicted happen on july th mr grace is indicted on th fired thereafter so now were days into this thing right now and peeling back whats going on you see the actions of the officer should be sharp deputy chief grayson is the tactics are just awful its against everything we teach you you isolate contain and deeply escalate the entire situation so you someone in the throes of some kind of distress that episode you to calm them down until you can get other people there to help them maybe take it to the hospital getting a neighbor or relative to help as well so these things that these things were thrown to the wind by sending her into the into the kitchen was something dont do you isolate and contain now it gets worse much afterwards so this is what were seeing right now the autopsy is just telling us we pretty much already know but it just makes it all the more awful for that family be going through it theres also a lot of focus beyond just that incident the missed red flags that might have been there the history of this former deputy grayson how he had held six different police jobs in the last years he was discharged from the army for serious misconduct how commonplace is it that these kind of backgrounds might be uniformed officers and how were these red flags missed so lets break it down those six jobs he had for years three of them all understandable he was part time so hes looking for full time job that part is understandable but thats three different six different processes he had to go through two prior duis both misdemeanors someone made a statement today that thats thats acceptable but the military charges the military background is whats really the most troubling ive seen

discipline that we dont know about all these things have to be put out i will tell you thats not the norm with those are usually those are red flags that you act upon they will not hire you across the

world news tonight with david americas number one most watched newscast across of television and morning america good morning good morning america you dont just see it you feel it im in here am good morning america hes a guy right now on abc news live massive wildfires exploding on the west coast nearly separate fires burning across multiple states were live the scene as firefighters work to put out the flames plus two of the biggest cartel leaders in mexico arrested in a dramatic operation straight out of a hollywood movie who they are and what it means for the surge in fentanyl pouring into the us and barack and michelle obama out with an endorsement of vice president kamala harris presidential run the race stands now and how soon we might see the obamas out there on the campaign trail hi im trevor ault our top story at this hour those massive wildfires burning out of control in the west more than wildfires are burning across california oregon and utah torching hundreds of thousands acres and forcing thousands of evacuations the park fire in northern alone has burned more than acres its the states biggest wildfire of the year authorities say this was arson and the suspect is under arrest our jaclyn lee joins us now chico california about miles north of sacramento so jacqueline whats the latest this park fire and how much of it is contained right now trevor right now is contained so we just spoke with the public information from cal fire and he told me just a few seconds ago that you initially they were saying it was contained when it was only about a acres but now given how much this fire has explode with more than acres burning he theyre starting over its contained this fire is just evolving so rapidly its growing so much and they have so resources now that are throwing out it just trying to get it under control trevor ault those resources jacqueline whats the weather doing to help or hurt this so the biggest issue that we have is it is very hot up here and theres also a lot of wind so were here at base camp and whats going on right now is you can see different trucks and you could probably hear it as well there are fire crews from all over the state that are coming up to help and so we just spoke with the fire chief from fresno he just got back from working a hour shift up on the front lines he said is just a wall of fire up there it is very difficult for guys up there because not only are they battling exhaustion theyre battling heat but its also concerning because theyre trying to you know protect the structures theyre working with residents trying to get them either to evacuate or to just stay safe overall in general so now were seeing different fire crews coming back from working some even hours in a row theyre getting food theyre getting supplies theyre getting rest and theyre going to right back out trevor into all those trucks mobilizing behind you jacqueline of course you have all this fire youre going to have smoke to has the air quality so right here where we are were at the base camp its as bad as it would be obviously up where the fire is burning i dont know if you can see this but right now it looks like theres a lot of clouds thats not thats actually smoke plumes and what whats happening is because this fire is growing so large its creating its own weather pattern within which for example that could mean it is creating windy conditions right where the fire is whereas other areas might not see that so of course thats a very dangerous but of course officials are warning everyone wear your respirators you really never know how these particles can affect your lungs of course even with all this massive resources and effort its going to take quite some time given all of these factors to get the fire out jaclyn lee for us jacqueline thank you on hand to politics now as the israeli prime minister hedging his bets when it comes to the presidential election benjamin netanyahu is now visiting former president donald trump at maralago well this trip to florida comes just one day after netanyahu met separately with president kamala harris and president biden in washington meantime the vice president is picking up a high profile endorsement from the obamas in a video released this morning take a listen we call to say michelle and i couldnt be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the oval office of course the vice president on a video call harkening back to we did it joe when famous video senior reporter katherine faulders and white house correspondent maryalice parks joe both join me now catherine well start with you so we have this meeting trump and netanyahu what are they hoping to achieve with todays and how does it compare to the meetings you had with biden and harris yesterday yeah our reporters were brought into this meeting last minute so were still trying to figure out exactly what was said in that meeting but the reality of this is that this is the first time that trump and netanyahu have sat down in four years you recall about four years ago when netanyahu was one of the first leaders to congratulate president joe biden on victory trump took offense to that because netanyahu wasnt buying the election fraud claims if you will so this is the first time that they have sat down in four years it will be interesting to hear ultimately what was said in that meeting but he was asked trump was asked about his relationship with netanyahu he said theyve always had a good relationship so well just have to see ultimately what comes out of this meeting but it appears from that video that they were sitting down having some sort of meal i would assume lunch yeah definitely an opportunity for trump to mark himself as diametrically opposed to biden or harris at least in terms of of their approaches towards israel maryalice not really surprised that the obamas are endorsing the vice president here but what does their endorsement actually mean for her yeah no big surprise that we were expecting this of course as weve seen other democratic leaders really rally her new candidacy the party moving forward shes now the presumptive nominee secured enough delegates even though not have officially voted yet but look this means a lot because no one is more popular in democratic party and they are just such prolific fundraisers so if we see president obama michelle obama out there on the campaign trail it will a huge difference now weve seen just this incredible momentum around harris new candidacy around her new campaign she honestly hasnt had a hard time raising money on her own so far but the question really now is does that sort of honeymoon phase end or is she able to build on this momentum going forward i think its a part of the reason that we actually saw a few days between when some of the other big endorsements came out and this one i think that the democrats are sort of trying to let this look like it was a little bit more organic and theyre trying to sort of keep that momentum up someone like former president obama who is such a sort of an old statesman in the party didnt want to make it appear as as if he had just sort of handpicked her but but well see if it actually sort of manifests itself campaigning for her beyond just that video and first endorsement driver catherine it does seem like we might not see the vice president on the debate stage former president trump hes casting some doubt on that is this gamesmanship or do you think theres actually a chance we wont see these two candidates debate oh look its hard tell with the former president of course all we know right now is that he agreed to the debate now the line is from the campaign and from trump that because theres no vice presidential candidate they dont have anybody officially on the ticket for example that he is just going to wait and see what happens there look well just have to wait and see with trump all we know is that he agreed and now he seems to be wavering a little bit but its its we just we just cant tell at this point any kind of holds all the cards in of whether he decides to do it or not maryalice of course the vice president now has to decide her own potential vice president where do we stand on that well were talking to the campaign is they are still casting a wide net that they are looking at nearly a dozen potential vice presidents and that they are running mates i should say and that they are still in the vetting process i some of these senators and governors you think of them as having a high profile of of being on the national stage but it is still different to have a team here actually look through absolutely everything that theyve ever said and theyre trying to do that vetting thats normally a months long process in a matter of days so this is tough it is all hands on deck they know this is sort of first major decision that she is going to make it could be the most consequential decision she makes for her campaign and a lot of these like you said theyre coming from battleground states so of course theres this theres a strategy here right as someone like a mark kelly a senator from arizona actually put arizona four more in play would josh shapiro governor of pennsylvania on the ticket really lock up pennsylvania for a hard to know but of course they are weighing those factors well as sort of these candidates past past statements policy positions and how they sort of jive with with kamala harris maryalice parks for us at the white house and katherine faulders thank you both meantime today federal officials are hailing the arrest of two top leaders of the notorious mexican sinaloa drug cartel ismael zimbardo garcia also known as el myo and joaquin guzman lopez the son of infamous drug lord el chapo they are both now behind bars here in the us after they were taken into custody in el paso texas now attorney general merrick garland says the cartel is one of the most violent and powerful cartels in the world responsible for shipping thousands of pounds of cocaine methamphetamine and fentanyl into the us every el mayo already appeared in federal court today in el paso pleading not guilty we want to bring in abc news senior justice and homeland security reporter jack doherty here for more jack very interesting story so you know a homeland security official tells abc news that this was an operation that had been planned months what do you know about how it unfolded well it it was done under the cloak of secrecy an extremely sensitive operation to get these two top leaders of the cartel into the united states in custody it was extraordinary that you know ismael el mayo somebody is hes been a leader of the cartel for nearly years plus years really and joaquin guzman is the son of el chapo one of his four sons who also formed part of the leadership of the powerful sinaloa cartel theyre responsible for enormous of death in this country tens of thousands of people die every year due to fentanyl overdoses theyre the chief importer and producer of this type of fentanyl also methamphetamine also cocaine and its a multitiered multibillion dollar business we have learned that even mexican officials jack didnt know this was happening until after these occurred what makes you think the fbi wanted to have these arrests take place us soil rather than extradite them from mexico well its huge advantage to have them arrested in the us because theyre facing charges in several districts in the united states and be able to sort of shortcut the extradition process takes years out of the process because that could get tied up in mexican courts for quite some time the security of the operation also can be kept intact by having be us operation mexican authorities are not acknowledged that this is a big breakthrough in the fight against the cartels but it did in fact take them by surprise that they were able to lure these two leaders of the sinaloa cartel into the united states so el milo had his initial appearance this morning in el paso court we know hes faced some charges in a number of jurisdictions over the years do those come into play now that hes under arrest absolutely its an opportunity to bring him finally to justice some of these charges have been pending for well over ten years and he pleaded not guilty in court today but he is likely to face detention pending trial and well see which charges they eventually go with in terms of his upcoming trials and as far as mr guzman he hasnt appeared yet but were waiting to see which charges he will initially face the united states so attorney general merrick garland says the department of justice will rest until every single cartel leader member and associate responsible poisoning our communities is held accountable now these are big arrests but these are two men where does the doj go from here exactly its a massive business with a huge infrastructure the cartel is able to operate effectively in all states in the united states dealing drugs at every level in the united states and so trying to uproot organization they could start at the top but boy they have to dig much down to really have an impact in terms of stopping the flow of drugs the united states because some other leaders will step in their place theres a lot of money to be made and theres plenty of incentive to continue to push drugs in the united states and the demand extraordinarily high here so still a lot of work to be done but definitely some major arrests checked out for us jack thank you very much and coming up here on abc like the latest on coordinated arson attacks on train lines in france just hours before the olympic opening ceremonies how many travelers are still stranded thats coming up next susan powell a young beautiful mother she just one night vanished where susan july th making sure

live first thing in the morning theres a lot going on were still in a flash flood warning to catch you up with what happened overnight police in riot gear arresting of protesters whats happening today escalating tensions in the middle east what people are talking about the migrant crisis fast straight forward with someone in between check out the gator on the th all the buzzkill in baseball first thing in the morning america this morning americas number one early morning news on abc news why thank you for streaming with us just hours before the opening ceremony of the in paris french authorities say there was a massive cohort attack on the countrys high speed train lines fires set along three lines cables were cut and this attack delayed trains at nearly every major station in paris and impacted at least people with those delays also affecting a separate train connects the uk to france want to dig in on this with more we have abcs as the local terror force in paris and as lets just start with where you are right now there in paris you have the olympics starting i imagine security very tight what are you seeing what are french officials saying hey driver yes we are just a few feet from where the opening ceremony is just about to get underway just a few feet from the said which is actually just down that street right there and you can see this police checkpoint behind me the streets have been closed to traffic for the most part theres clearly some cars getting in and out but its been very restricted and theres you can go in paris really without running into some kind of security presence law enforcement presence more than police officers have been deployed just for the opening ceremony additional members of the military there have also been members other law enforcement forces from from countries around the world that have been sent in to lend hand the airspace over paris is closed as well so no flights getting in and out of paris nothing flying over paris right now to try and keep the opening ceremonies as safe as possible you can imagine challenge that this poses theyre trying to hold this outdoors you know this is the first time ever that the opening ceremony is going to be held outside of a stadium so security measures have been really ramped up to try and keep everything going smoothly and even with all that security and as we still have this attack on the train lines whats the latest officials there and how long do we think it can take to get it all repaired yeah really alarming development there so french officials saying that there were there was this massive coordinated attack on french railway system fires set at a number of railway stations around the country they say that they believe was deliberately done to destabilize the olympics and that high speed rail lines were specifically targeted and like you mentioned at the top there the train from the uk the eurostar was also affected so over passengers have been impacted all of these people trying to get to the opening ceremony trying to get to paris in time for the beginning of the games we understand initially we were told that would take until monday for traffic to resume normally we understand as of just a few moments ago officials did say that things were improving theyve been working on it all day and so we are going to start seeing some significant improvements starting tomorrow and that they call this arson but theyre not calling it terrorism at least so far ines de la cuetara thank you very much reporting for us in paris meantime an official autopsy report today confirmed back here at home that the death sonia massy was indeed a homicide yearold black woman died of a gunshot wound to the head after she was shot by police inside her own apartment officials say the mother of called herself to report a suspicious person before things escalated we want to warn you this video may be difficult watch for us what youre seeing in water in the water over the neighborhood tuesday afternoon pouring out of hot cross shots shots fired shots are difficult to watch so the department did quickly fire that officer who pulled the trigger deputy grayson he was then indicted for first degree murder and aggravated battery today the family is calling for more accountability and justice for sonia masi they told me that theyre going to go there to her and then this happens here so she was seeking the help she a helping hand not a bullet to the face so we want to bring in abc news contributor and former nypd of detectives robert boyce robert thanks so much for being here your reaction number one to how this happened but also the immediate response police with the firing and even an apology from the department know good to be with you so you look at this thing almost immediately by worn camera they know what happened so it takes us back to july th hes indicted on july six mr grace is indicted on the th and immediately fired thereafter so now were days into this thing right now and peeling back whats going on you see the actions of the officer should be sheriff deputy sheriff grayson is the tactics are just awful its against everything we teach you you isolate contain and dig escalate the entire situation so you have someone in the throes of kind of distress that episode you want to calm them down until you can get other people there to help them maybe take it to the hospital getting a neighbor or a relative to help as well so these things that these things were trying to win by sending her into the into the kitchen which is something we dont do you isolate and contain now it gets worse much worse afterwards so this is what were seeing right now the autopsy is just telling us but we pretty much already know but it just makes it all the more awful for that family to be on it also a lot of focus beyond just that incident but the missed red flags might have been there the history of this former deputy grayson he had held six different police jobs in the last four years he was discharged from the army for serious misconduct how commonplace is it that these kind of backgrounds might be with a uniformed officers and how were these red flags missed so lets break it down those six jobs he had for years three of them on and on the stand while he was part time so hes looking for a full time job that part is understandable but theres three different six different processes he had to go through two prior duis both misdemeanors someone made a statement today that thats acceptable im going to put the military charge his military background is whats really the most troubling ive seen so he there he is about year months into his assignment at that sheriffs office and this happened what was happening in between there how many supervision did he have did he have any discipline that we dont know about all these things have to be put out i will tell you thats not the norm with those dwis they usually those are red flags that they act upon they will not hire you across the nation so thats a little surprising and the military records and all thats even worse so these things are not the theyre outside the not from what my understanding is from my years in law enforcement you dont see this and bob a simple question but im sure the answer is quite complicated what needs to change to stop things like this from happening think weve done a lot to be honest with these body worn cameras put you on the spot they they record your actions training more training but again the tactics are terrible the hiring practices is a lot coming in here into this we dont know exactly what his everyday life was from officer grayson but when people call for help we should give it to him and something like this slight woman should have it contained easily and officers do this every day across the united states you know in thousands of every day so when things like this happen we really have to do a deep that this this should not have gone the way it was and theres going to be a lot of eyes this for a long time robert boyce thank you very much for your time always nice to talk to you and coming voters in venezuela head to the polls for the countrys most pivotal election in decades i have the details after the break what does take to be the most watched newscast in america an

to put out the flames plus emotional remarks from the family of sonia massey who was shot dead by police in her own apartment after calling help from an intruder the latest on the investigation into her death up and donald trump meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who for the first time in four years details on that moment as opponent vice president kamala harris brings in another major endorsement hi everyone im trevor ault our story at this hour the massive wildfires that are burning out of control in the west more than wildfires are burning across california and utah torching hundreds of thousands of acres and thousands of evacuations the park fire in northern california alone is burning more than acres it is the states wildfire of the year authorities say this was arson and the suspect is under arrest abcs jaclyn lee joins me now from chico california which is about miles north of sacramento so jacqueline the latest here on the park fire what are firefighters there telling you on the ground thats right so first off i mean were still sitting on more than acres burned and its not contained at any whatsoever so what were seeing here at base camp is these firefighters going in shifts so were seeing those who are working for the last hours on the front lines they are part of the strike teams that first mobilized when the fire broke out they are now returning theyre getting food some rest before they have to go back out again now were also seeing all across the state theres different fire crews different battalions coming up from all over even far down from southern california theyre coming up to let these guys get a rest but were also hearing is that these fire crews are coming from other fires throughout the state and they are considered fresh when they arrive here at base camp then theyre sent back out to the park fire so were just seeing a number of firefighters just going in these revolving shifts trevor and we see that movement behind you jacqueline around because were going to come back to you but we do want to also bring in cal fire battalion chief david acuna who is with us now so chief thank you so much for being here we know this fire really exploded in size in a pretty short time how much of a factor is the weather here both in the spread of the fire and also how its impacting the firefighters efforts to get it contained you it absolutely is a significant issue to have such hot weather with the winds and jacqueline made an interesting point she said that when firefighters they are considered fresh one thing we have to consider though is that with firefighter fatigue these firefighters have been fighting wildfires since the end of may nearly consistently perhaps they home perhaps not its just such a challenge for all the firefighters for how long theyve been out on the road what is the key to keeping them fresh and them safe we do make sure that we rotate them where work rest cycles and ensuring that we have sufficient numbers of firefighters on scene for the incidents in order to make sure that they get their time off there are so many incidents right now sometimes they are stretched thin but we do our best to give them work rest cycle as we can you say you have enough firefighters do you need more could always use more and thats where thankfully we have partnerships with our government agencies with our federal agencies and using coordination centers that are run by both cal and the federal system were able to send firefighters where they need to go at the right time some of that teamwork in action behind so jaclyn youve mentioned this before in your reporting but what is the latest on the air quality with all this smoke in the air right drivers do you have to think about as this fire continues to grow in size youre seeing i dont know if you can actually see it but theres a huge plume of smoke thats billowing up into the air and obviously when you have conditio like this when its very windy when its very hot and you have multiple fires burning throughout the state and were also seeing it in other states all of the wind is going to be spreading this around so that makes very dangerous conditions for residents so of course officials are warning residents you want to put on those respirators you want to think about your lungs so the air quality is not great here at base camp though its not too bad because we are a little bit away from the fire trevor okay well we hope it stays that way jaclyn lee for us in chico and cal fire battalion chief david acuna thank you both for your time on head to politics and the israeli prime minister is covering all his bases on his to the united states benjamin benjamin netanyahu is visiting president donald trump at maralago today that trip to florida comes just one day after netanyahu met separately with vice president kamala harris president biden in washington at the same time the vice president is picking up a pretty high profile endorsement from the obamas as democrats continue to get behind her in the wake of bidens decision to leave the race on jonah by white house correspondent maryalice parks whos right there at the white house for us maryalice what do we know with netanyahu and his trip hes got this meeting with the former president have we learned anything about that meeting far seems like they sat down for lunch there in mar a lago some ominous words from the former president to reporters the room saying that if he wasnt elected there would be more wars throughout the world of course we have seen him supporting israel in the most sort of the strictest strongest terms but thats very similar language what we heard yesterday from president biden this is interesting split screen because of course for president trump is a former president and the current president is actively in these negotiations to try to bring an end to the war right now not talking in hypotheticals but talking in terms of the negotiating that is very much alive and active you know we heard president biden and the white house talking about how they really believed a ceasefire deal was was achievable that the gaps were close the ball that they were within arms reach and the white house really focused on making sure that that hostage deal gets over the finish line so to see sort of the white house working while trump is still doing his own shadow diplomacy obviously hoping to get back to the white house but president biden hoping that this war is over and they are in a phase of sort of rebuilding gaza figuring what comes after this war well before the elections in november and of course before january look at that the campaign maryalice the former running mate senator jd vance has been catching a lot of flack hes catching some more flack today another old interview surfaced this time with him advocating for higher taxes on americans dont have children how is he responding to that today i mean hes basically said that those comments were taken out of context that people are making too much out of it but he does sort of double down on this idea he thinks that democrats have become too antifamily that republicans are the family that sort of the party of families i can you that theres a lot of democrats here at the white house who would of course strongly push back against notion democrats say that they are the party that has pitched to universal prek and paid family leave and raise the minimum wage so i think that at some point senator vance and the republican ticket is going to have to talk about policy proposals that they backing to be sort of the party of the family but look those are some of the policy perspective here in dc we get walking really fast but on the campaign trail those comments arent sitting well theyre not sitting well independent women theyre not sitting well of course with the democratic base i think if anything rallying even more people in the democratic party to kamala harris inside but but theyre even conservative women i think really frustrated when theyre seeing some of these old clips surfaced this is not not what republicans need right now is not the message they want to be sending this is a moment where they were hoping to really solidify and unify the republican party bring some of those conservative women who frankly had been put off in past elections by trump and by former president trumps sort of language women they wanted to bring them back into the fold they dont need these sort comments right now and this is going to be tough and the republicans know that they are playing cleanup we did have today whats likely the last major democratic in the form of the obamas backing vice president kamala harris for president not really a surprise in any context took maybe a couple days after a few other major endorsements but what does this mean for her campaign its not a huge surprise whats going to matter is if they go out and campaign for her these are two of the most effective campaigners in the democratic party they bring in so much money people from all over to see them they can be such a force out on the campaign theyre just incredibly popular and so i think its going to make a really big difference if we see them out hitting the trail on her behalf you know michelle obama and chooses when she goes out does not do it very often i think that thats really what well be looking for thats really what could make a difference frankly the vice president has proven in the last week that she need a lot of help raising money shes been just sort of these these numbers that her campaign are bringing in their eye popping just sort of record shattering but these endorsements dont hurt they are they are good for the democratic base obviously exciting for her campaign she is feeling all the love and a lot of momentum right now yeah and they certainly want to capitalize on all that momentum maryalice parks for us at the white house thank you very much meantime federal officials are hailing the arrest of two top leaders of the notorious mexican sinaloa drug cartel ismael zimbardo garcia also known as el myo and joaquin guzman lopez son of infamous drug lord el chapo they are both now behind bars here in the us after they were taken into custody in el paso texas attorney general merrick says the cartel is one of the most violent and powerful drug cartels in the world responsible for shipping thousands of pounds of cocaine methamphetamines and fentanyl into the us every day el mayo already appeared in federal court today in el paso pleading not we want to bring in abc news senior justice and homeland security reporter dorsey for more along with abc news contributor and former federal prosecutor john katko thank you both for being here jack lets start with you so what are you hearing from your sources about how this went down i would imagine is something that took a great deal of planning given how significant these men are absolutely it was a carefully orchestrated fbi and agents from the department of security homeland security investigations orchestrated a way for these two drug cartel leaders to basically fly into texas el mayo we believe but thought that he was actually flying to inspect an airstrip a clandestine airstrip in northern mexico he ended up landing in texas and was greeted by agents from the fbi and cia and put into along with el chapos son one of the four sons that had been part of the leadership of the sinaloa cartel so both men are in custody as you mentioned appeared earlier today in and were awaiting the appearance of a of guzman john i believe you were a federal prosecutor right there in el paso put this in historical context for us as to what this what these arrests mean and also how something like could unfold the planning to make sure that it happens well first of all i did those cases in el paso going after the cartels and this is a very big deal that they were able to get probably the largest cartels leadership decapitate them by luring them into the united states it just takes a lot of planning takes a lot of probably cooperating witnesses on both sides of the border theres a million reward for the capture people are enticed by that and they came across the border in that regard and whats really important this is its supremely disruptive to the sinaloa cartel which is probably the one of the biggest in the world and now theres a power and now the cartel will be fighting amongst itself to who takes over because theres not really clear who the succession would be and also because of that succession vacuum theres going be a lot of fights and theres not going to be its not going to clear whos in charge and what the operational mandate will be going forward so this is a very big thing it takes an awful lot of work from people on both sides of the border and you can understand the importance of it jack we know that el mayo had that initial appearance in this morning in el paso federal court hes of course face some other charges in a number of other jurisdictions jurisdictions through the years maybe not surprising that somebody who is as prominent as they say within the cartel would be facing a lot of different criminal charges but how does that all come into play now well the justice department has lot of options they have a lot of cards to play now they have several cases in at least three districts against el mayo that they can bring but they make see how they can use their resources most efficiently and bring their best case forward you know to see how that proceed to see if theyre able to get a sentence thats quite significant it may make the other cases less relevant to move forward with but they have a lot of options here they hold all the cards right now and as you said amado has pleaded not guilty but hes not a young man and could be facing the rest of his life in the us prison john you touched on this in your first answer but if you could expand on it i mean the term that you used was decapitating the cartel by arresting the people up at the top but for as large as these organizations these are two men that have been arrested we know were going to have that power struggle here but what does this mean in terms of the united states ability to fight back against these cartels weaken the distribution of deadly drugs in this country well by decapitating the leadership theyre always creates a power vacuum and as you might imagine individuals who to succeed to the throne if you will to take over the cartel are going to have rivals and they become this becomes an unbelievably nasty fight internally theres a lot of violence theres going to be a lot of back and forth and thats naturally disruptive to their operations and thats thats one of the main goals of of taking them out and also to try and help the mexican government theyre under siege and they really have a hard time running their government because of the power that the cartels and that power has been greatly enhanced in the last few years because of the number of people coming across the border and it will take time to a person to come across and just do the math these cartels are getting rich to the tune of probably close to a month just in human trafficking or drug trafficking so to disrupt that operation is very very helpful to law on many many levels okay well two major arrests john katko jack dorsey thank you both for your time always nice to speak with you both and coming up here we have the latest on coordinated arson attacks on train lines in france only hours before the olympic opening ceremonies we have the details next

no stunning details he ends up revealing the biggest bombshell what will happen next tonight at nine eight central on abc thank you for streaming with us just hours the opening ceremony at the olympics in paris french authorities say there a massive coordinated attack on the countrys high speed lines fires were set along three lines cables were cut and this attack delayed trains at nearly every major station in paris it impacted at least people throughout the weekend those are also affecting a separate train which connects the uk to france we want to get more this were bringing in abcs and as the liquid tara whos reporting for us from paris ines what is the latest here on this attack on the train lines what are officials passengers about how long it might take to get a repair here trevor yeah and that was really the big story today on the security front was this massive arson attack on the french railway networks according to the french railway company sncf theyre calling this a coordinated attack they say that fires were set at a number of railway stations around the country that cables were cut in some cases and they say that the attackers here were specifically high speed railway lines so like you mentioned the eurostar from to paris was affected they believe that about passengers have been impacted people who were trying get to the olympics trying to get to paris in time for the opening ceremonies initially these these officials had said that you know these these issues could run through monday we did hear from them a few ago and they did say that things were slightly improving so theyve been working it all day and they do expect some significant improvements by tomorrow youre quoting them when you call this a coordinated attack and as they are not calling this terrorism right now are they saying anything about potential suspects no word yet on the potential suspects like you say it is significant theyre not calling it terrorism i think thats the big concern here you know officials here have certainly ramped up security measures ahead of the olympics the fear being that know with everything going on in the world there could be bad actors taking advantage of the situation this is this ones not being called a terror attack and they havent said as to you know who could be behind this we assume its a group of people you know there were a number of different attacks at different train stations around the country but still no word on who could be behind this i will say in recent days and weeks have been arresting a number of kind of suspects there was a russian man arrested earlier this week who was being accused of of trying to destabilize the olympics they didnt say just how he was planning to do that he is believed to have been a russian spy so you know thats just one example of of one case of someone theyve arrested who was trying to sow discord here at the olympics very interesting to see this happen given the gigantic security footprint there in paris and as the look of terror force thank you very much ines meantime back here at home an official autopsy report today confirmed the death of sonya massey was indeed a homicide sonya massey a year old black woman who died of a wound to the head after she was shot by police inside her own apartment and officials say the mother of two called herself to report a suspicious before things escalated and we want to warn you the video may difficult to watch but for us were seeing water in the water over particular neighborhood tuesday afternoon saw how she came out of high cross shots fired shots fired shots fired so the police department quickly fired the officer who pulled the trigger deputy grayson he was then indicted for first degree murder and aggravated battery today the family of massey called for more accountability and justice they told me that theyre going to go there to help her and then this happens so she was sick and she needed a helping hand not a bullet to the face and now we want to bring in former detective marc claxton marc thank you so much for being here before we get to the more specific questions i would just like to hear your reaction upon seeing that body camera video of what happened it really a shocking display of a lack of humanity by the former deputy president and to this mass he laid on the ground afterwards on the floor dying and it really demonstrated that she had an awareness of the level of evil that was before her in the form of deputy grayson which is why she probably uttered those words i rebuke unanimous eight but its just disturbing and tragically just familiar weve been here before and im afraid that unless theres significant change and shift away from the current policing model you know well be here again and talking about the policing marc you wrote an article before that was titled a policing for the st century we have a quote from it you say a criminal justice system or more specifically a policing system that creates and cultivates a model of enforcement that increases unnecessary civilian is a broken system that has resulted in and will continue to lead to avoidable loss of life you wrote that back in have we made any progress since then minimal if any but really nothing that you can really chart not across the nation and thats part of problem is that there is no national standard or even a national monitoring system to ensure that agencies across the nation are compliant with some set standards you know these these these incidents not mere lapses tactical lapses or simple or mere tragedies its an unavoidable outcome of a structurally outdated policing model which too often is fed by implicit bias and over overreliance on the use of force and it fails to prioritize basic public service even responding to as is this case the calls for assistance the public and unfortunately without a significant structural change the well be back here again having the same conversation after this shooting the deputy was fired the police department issued an apology but did also hear allegations from sonia massies family that police did not initially tell them who shot her that they actually originally believed was the intruder that she had called the police to try to get some help for what do you make of both those allegations and the police department is responding the more that leaks out the police response the more troubling and disturbing it becomes it seems all too familiar how police agencies engage in certain activities that lead these type of incidents these deaths avoidable deaths and then engage in the process of covering their bases covering their behinds covering them their manpower instead of releasing as much information as humanly possible as quickly as possible and being honest with the public or at least honest with the families involved just adds to the level of tragedy and pain that families are suffering and it also gives the public an opportunity to second guess what may be some sound decisions made by police in some cases so its just you know sometimes the cover up like they say is worse than the crime and when police agencies releases information it slowly and haltingly as they have been releasing information it really promotes and supports the suspicion of the public former nypd

plus two of the biggest cartel leaders in mexico arrested in a dramatic straight out of a hollywood movie who they are and what means for the surge in fentanyl pouring into the us and barack michelle obama out with an endorsement of vice president kamala harris presidential run but the race stands now and how soon we might see the obamas out there on the campaign trail hi everyone im trevor ault our top story at this hour those massive wildfires burning out of control in the west more than wildfires are burning across california oregon and utah torching hundreds of thousands of acres and forcing thousands of the park fire in northern california alone has burned more than acres its the states biggest wildfire of the year authorities say this was arson and the suspect under arrest our jaclyn lee joins us now from chico california about miles north of sacramento so jacqueline whats the latest on this park fire and much of it is contained right now well travel right now is contained so we just spoke with the public information officer from cal fire and he told me just a few seconds ago that you know initially they were saying it was contained when it was only about acres but now given how much this fire has exploded with more than acres burning he said starting over its contained this fire is just evolving so rapidly its growing so much and they have so resources now that are throwing out it just trying to get it under control trevor all those resources jacqueline whats the weather doing to help or hurt this so the biggest issue that we have is it is very hot up here and theres also a lot of wind so were here at base camp and whats going on right is you could see different trucks you could probably hear it as well there are fire crews all over the state that are coming up to help and so we just spoke with the fire chief from fresno he just got back working a hour shift up on the front lines he said it is just a wall of fire up there it is very difficult for the guys up there because not only are they battling exhaustion theyre battling heat but its also concerning because theyre trying to you know protect the structures are working with residents trying to get them either to evacuate or to you know just stay safe overall in general so now were seeing different fire crews coming back from working some even hours in a row theyre getting food theyre getting supplies theyre getting rest and theyre going right back out trevor into all those trucks mobilizing behind you jacqueline of course you have all this fire youre going to have smoke to hows the air quality so right here we are were at the base camp its not as bad as it would be obviously where the fire is burning i dont know if you can see this but right now it looks like theres a lot of clouds thats not thats actually plumes and what whats happening is because this fire is growing so large its creating its own weather pattern within which for example that could mean it is creating windy conditions right where the fire is whereas other areas might not see that so of course thats a very dangerous but of course officials are warning everyone wear your respirators you really never know how these particles can affect your lungs tremor of course even with all this massive resources and effort its going to take some time given all of these factors to get the fire out jaclyn lee forest jacqui thank you one had to politics now as the israeli prime minister is hedging his bets when it comes to the presidential election benjamin is now visiting former president donald trump at maralago well this trip to florida comes just one day after netanyahu separately with vice president kamala harris and president biden in washington meantime the vice president is picking up a high profile endorsement from the obamas in a video released this morning take a listen we call to say michelle and i couldnt be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the oval office of course the vice president on a video harkening back to we did it joe in that famous video senior reporter katherine faulders and white house correspondent maryalice parks joe both join me now catherine well start you so we have this meeting now trump and netanyahu what are they hoping to achieve with todays meeting and how does it compare to the meetings you had with biden harris yesterday yeah and our reporters were brought into this meeting last minute were still trying to figure out exactly what was said in that meeting but the reality of this is that this is the first time that trump and netanyahu have sat down four years you recall about four years ago when netanyahu was one of the first leaders to congratulate president joe biden on his victory trump took offense to that because netanyahu wasnt buying into the election fraud claims if you will so this is the first time that they have sat down four years it will be interesting to hear ultimately what was said in that meeting he was asked trump was asked about his relationship with netanyahu he said theyve always had a good relationship so well just have to see ultimately what comes out of this meeting but it appears from that video that they were sitting down having some sort of meal i would assume lunch yeah definitely opportunity for trump to mark himself as diametrically opposed to biden or harris at least in terms of some of their approaches towards israel maryalice not really a surprise that the obamas are endorsing the vice president here but what does their endorsement actually mean for yeah no big surprise that we were expecting this of course as weve other democratic leaders really rally to her can do candidacy party moving forward shes now the presumptive nominee having secured enough even though none have officially voted yet but look this means lot because no one is more popular in the democratic party and are just such prolific fundraisers so if we see president obama obama out there on the campaign trail it will make a huge difference know weve seen just this incredible momentum around harris as new around her new campaign she honestly hasnt had a hard time raising money on her own so far but the question really now is does that sort of honeymoon phase end or is she able to just build on this momentum going forward i think its a part of the reason that we actually saw it a few days between when some of the other big endorsements came out and this one i think that democrats are sort of trying to let this look like it was a little bit more organic and theyre trying to sort of keep that momentum up someone like former president obama who is such a sort of an old statesman the party didnt want to make it appear as as he had just sort of handpicked her but but well see if it actually sort of manifests itself into campaigning for her beyond just that video and first endorsement driver catherine it does seem like we might not the vice president on the debate stage with former president trump hes some doubt on that is this gamesmanship or do you think theres actually a chance we wont see these two candidates debate oh look its hard to tell with the former president of course all we know right now is that he agreed to the debate now the line is from the campaign and from trump that because no vice presidential candidate they dont have anybody officially on the ticket for example that he is just going to wait and see what happens there look well just have to wait and see with trump all we know is that he agreed and now he seems to be wavering a little bit but its its we just we just cant tell at this point trevor any kind of holds all the cards in terms of whether he decides to do it or not maryalice of course the vice president now has to decide own potential vice president where do we stand on that search were told from the campaign is they are still casting a wide net that they are looking at nearly dozen potential vice presidents and that they are running mates i should say and that they are still in the vetting process i mean some of these senators governors you think of them as having a high profile of of of being on the national stage but it is still different to have a team here actually look through absolutely everything that theyve ever said and theyre trying to do that vetting thats normally a months long process in a matter of days so this is tough it is all hands on deck they know this is sort of the first major decision that shes going to make it could be the most consequential decision she makes for her campaign and a lot of these like you said theyre coming from battleground states so of course theres this theres a strategy here right does someone like a mark kelly a senator from arizona actually put arizona four more in play would josh shapiro the governor of on the ticket really lock up pennsylvania for democrats hard to know and of course they are weighing those factors as well as sort of these candidates past past statements policy positions and how they sort of jive with with kamala harris maryalice parks us at the white house and katherine faulders thank you both meantime today federal officials are hailing the arrest of two top leaders of the notorious mexican sinaloa drug cartel ismael zimbardo garcia also as el myo and joaquin guzman lopez the son of infamous drug lord el chapo they are both now behind bars here in the us after they were taken into custody in el paso texas now attorney general merrick garland says the cartel is one of the most violent and powerful drug cartels in the world responsible for shipping thousands of of cocaine methamphetamine and fentanyl into the us every day el mayo already appeared in federal court today in el paso not guilty we want to bring in abc news senior justice and homeland reporter jack doherty here for more jack very interesting story so you know a homeland security official tells abc news that this was an operation that had been planned for months what do you know about how it unfolded well it was it was done under the cloak of secrecy an extremely sensitive operation to get these two top leaders of the cartel into the united states in it was extraordinary that you know ismael mayo somebody is hes been a leader of the cartel for nearly years plus years really and joaquin guzman is the son of el chapo one of his four sons who also form part of the leadership of the powerful sinaloa cartel theyre responsible for enormous amounts of in this country tens of thousands of people die every year due to fentanyl overdoses theyre the chief importer and producer of this type of fentanyl also methamphetamine also cocaine and its a multitiered multilayered multibillion dollar business we have learned that even mexican officials jack didnt know this was happening until after these arrests occurred what makes you think the fbi wanted to have these arrests place on us soil rather than extradite them from mexico well its a huge advantage to have them arrested in the us because theyre facing charges in several districts in the united states and be able to sort of shortcut the entire extradition process takes years out of the process because that could get tied up in mexican courts for quite some time the security of the operation also can be kept intact by having the us operation mexican authorities have not acknowledged that is a big breakthrough in the fight against the cartels but it did in fact take them by surprise that they able to lure these two leaders of the sinaloa cartel into the united states so el milo had his initial appearance this morning in el paso federal court we know hes faced some charges in a number of jurisdictions over the years do those come into play now that hes under arrest absolutely its an opportunity to bring him finally to justice some of these charges have been pending for well over ten years and he pleaded not guilty in court today but he is likely to detention pending trial and well see which charges they eventually go with in terms of his upcoming trial and as far as mr guzman he hasnt appeared yet but were waiting to see which charges will initially face in the united states so attorney general merrick garland says the department justice will not rest until every single cartel leader and associate responsible for poison in our communities is held accountable now these are big arrests but these are two men does the doj go from here exactly its a massive business enterprise with a huge infrastructure the cartel is able to operate effectively in all states in the united states dealing drugs at every level in the united states and so trying to uproot the organization they could start at the top but boy they have to dig much deeper down to really have an impact in terms stopping the flow of drugs into the united states because some other leaders will step up in their place theres a lot of money to be made and theres plenty of incentive continue to push drugs in the united states and the demand remains extraordinarily here so still a lot of work to be done but definitely some major arrests jack dark day for us jack thank you very much and coming up here on abc news live the latest coordinated arson attacks on train lines in france just hours before the olympic opening ceremonies how many travelers are still stranded thats coming up next what does it take to be the most watched newscast in america operation happy your life is a combat

watch news tonight with david muir than any other newscast thank you for streaming us just hours before the opening ceremony of the olympics in paris french authorities say there was a massive coordinated attack on the countrys high speed train lines fires were set along three lines cables were cut and this attack delayed trains at nearly every major station in paris it impacted at least people with those delays also affecting a separate which connects the uk to france want to dig in on this with more have abcs ines de la cuetara for us in paris and as lets just start with where you are right now there in paris you have the olympics starting i imagine is very tight what are you seeing what are french officials saying driver yes we are just a few feet where the opening ceremony is just about to get underway just a few feet from the sand river which is actually just down that street right there and you can see this police checkpoint behind me the streets have been closed to traffic for the most part theres clearly some cars still getting in and out but its been very restricted and theres nowhere you can go in paris really without running into some kind of security presence law enforcement presence more than police officers have been deployed just for the opening ceremony an additional members of the military there have also been members of other law enforcement forces from from countries around the world that have been sent in to lend a hand the airspace over paris is closed well so no flights getting in and out of paris nothing flying paris right now to try and keep the opening ceremonies as safe as possible you can imagine the challenge that this poses theyre trying to hold this outdoors you know this is the first time ever that the opening ceremony is going to be held outside of a stadium so security measures have been really ramped up to try and keep everything going smoothly and even with all that security and as we still have attack on the train lines whats the latest from officials there and how long do we think it could take to get it all repaired yeah really alarming development there so french officials saying that there there was this massive coordinated attack on the french railway fires set at a number of railway stations around the country they say that they believe this was deliberately to destabilize the olympics and that high speed rail lines were specifically targeted and like you mentioned off the top there the train from the uk the eurostar was also affected so over eight hundred thousand passengers have been impacted all of these people trying to get to the opening ceremony trying to get to paris in time for the beginning of the games we understand initially we were told that it would take until monday for traffic to resume we understand as of just a few moments ago officials did say that things were improving theyve been working on it all day and so we are going to start seeing some significant improvements starting tomorrow and notable that they call this arson but theyre not calling it terrorism at least so far ines de la cuetara thank you very much reporting for us in paris meantime an official autopsy report today confirm back here at home that the death of sonia massy was indeed a homicide a year old black woman died of a gunshot wound to the head after she was shot by police inside her own apartment officials say the mother of two called herself to report a suspicious before things escalated we want to warn you this video may be difficult to watch for us at your house even water away from the water where the neighbors choose to use safe hot cross shots fired shots fired shots fired very difficult to watch so the police department did quickly fire that officer who pulled the trigger deputy sean grayson he was then indicted for first degree murder and aggravated battery today the family calling for more accountability and justice for sonia masi what have they told me that theyre to go there to help her and then this happens so she was seeking help she needed a helping hand not bullet to the face so we want to bring in abc news contributor and former nypd chief of detectives robert boyce robert thanks so much for being here your reaction number one to how this happened but also the immediate response from police with the firing and even an apology from the department good good to be with you trevor so you look at this thing almost immediately by body worn camera they know what happened so it takes us back to july th hes indicted on july six mr grace is indicted on the th and immediately thereafter so now were days into this thing right now and peeling back whats going on you see the actions of the officer excuse me sheriff deputy sheriff grayson is the tactics just awful its against everything we teach you isolate contain and dig to escalate entire situation so you have someone in the throes of some kind of distress that episode you want to calm them down until you can get other people there to help them maybe take it to the hospital getting a neighbor or a relative help as well so these things that these things were thrown to the wind by sending her into into the kitchen was something we dont do you isolate and contain it gets worse much worse afterwards so this is what were seeing right now the autopsy is just telling us for weeks pretty much already now but it just makes all the more awful for that family to be going through it theres also a lot of focus beyond just that incident but the missed red flags that might have been there the history of this former deputy grayson how he had held six different police jobs in the last four years he was discharged from the army serious misconduct how commonplace is it that these of backgrounds might be with uniformed officers and how were these red flags missed so lets break it down those jobs he had for years three of them are understandable was part time so hes looking for a full time job that part is understandable but theres three different six different processes he had to go two prior duis both misdemeanors someone made a statement today that that thats acceptable but the military charges military background is whats really the most troubling ive so he there he is about a year months into his assignment at that sheriffs office and this happened what was happening in between there how many supervision levels did he have did he have any discipline that we dont know about all these things have to be put out i will tell you thats not the norm with those dwis are usually those are red flags that you act upon they would not hire you across the nation so thats a little surprising and the military records it all thats even worse so these things are not the norm theyre outside the norm from what my understanding is in my years in law enforcement we dont see this and finally bob a simple question but im sure the answer is quite complicated what needs to change to stop things like this from happening i think what weve done a lot traveled with these body worn cameras put you on the spot they they record your actions training and more training but again the tactics are terrible the hiring is a lot coming in here into this we dont know exactly what his everyday life was officer grayson but when people call for help we do something like this slight woman should be contained easily and officers do this every across the united states and thousands of instances every day so if things like this happen we really have to do a deep dive theres this should not have gone the way it was and theres going to be a lot of eyes on this for a long time robert boyce thank you very much for your time always nice to talk to you coming up voters in venezuela head

exploding on the west coast with nearly separate fires burning across multiple states were live on the scene as firefighters work to put out the flames plus remarks from the family of sonia massey who was shot dead police in her own apartment after she called for help from intruder the latest on the investigation into her death coming up and donald trump meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu for the first time in four years we have details on that moment as his opponent vice president kamala harris brings in another major endorsement hi everyone im trevor ault our top story at this hour are those massive wildfires burning out of control in the west more than wildfires are burning across california oregon and utah torching of thousands of acres forcing thousands of evacuations the park fire in northern california alone has burned more than acres its the states biggest wildfire of the year far authorities say this was arson and the suspect under arrest well cal fire battalion chief david acuna joins me now for the latest on this the chief what is the latest on the park fire and we heard anything about homes and buildings being impacted by trevor thank you for having us on so the park fire as you mentioned is acres unfortunately there have been homes destroyed that weve located we are continuing that assessment and any additional information well provide okay and we do also we have our jaclyn lee whos on the scene in chico california you been there at one of the sites where weve seen a lot of these different firefighters a lot of different organizations kind of using it as a base what are you seeing on the ground and what are you seeing with the air quality with all this smoke thats where you are actually i dont know if you guys were able to see this earlier but if you can see this massive plume of smoke over here it just it looks like clouds but its clearly not just because of how big this fire has grown weve spoken a handful of firefighters who have been on the front lines for some hours they were coming back swapping out some food and rest as other firefighters from around the state get to go and then fight these on the front lines take a listen what they had to say for the most part a lot of them did agree to leave some they dont want to leave their homes they want to do everything they can to protect their homes and some of them need a little more coaxing if you will like hey its not safe to be here you know and theyre just theyre scared they want they want help and a lot of people just dont know what to do and so of course when these firefighters go to these different some of them are tasked with trying to protect structures and ultimately if residents dont want to leave thats their prerogative but ultimately theyre trying to keep the firefighters are trying to keep these people as safe as possible trevor david these are not the first wildfires that these crews have had to battle so far this year and that certainly wont be the last one how do you manage the burnout when you have so many different battles going on at the same time well as you know fire is no stranger to wildfire so we do have established work west cycles where firefighters will be on for hours and then hours on our road and we start talking about working in extreme heat like we saw in june and are currently experiencing in july many times we had to send additional firefighters because those work risk cycles have to be shortened or the minimum reduce the workload by having additional firefighters at scene jaclyn how has the weather is it helping or hurting you know in general i mean i only if you can see it but wind is a massive right so youre dealing with extreme temperatures above the one hundreds youre dealing with wind and pair that with low humidity that just creates all this fuel to add to these fires and on top of that california has received so much rain over the last few years so you have vegetation you have all of this growth which is adds fuel to the fires tremor of course and cal fire battalion chief david acuna thank you both for your time moving over to politics now former president trump said thered peace in the middle east if hes back in the white house former president making those comments after meeting with israeli prime minister netanyahu at mar a lago netanyahus trip to florida comes one day after he met separately with vice president kamala harris and with president biden in washington at the same time vice president harris has picked up a pretty high profile endorsement from the obamas this morning not a surprise democrats continuing to get behind her the wake of bidens decision to leave the race were joined now by white house maryalice parks for the latest here so obviously not a ton of details yet about this meeting with netanyahu maryalice i think you can hear me now about that driver no problem i think were all good and i know that you can hear me i was just asking what what do we know so far about that meeting between netanyahu and trump they put out a readout the trump team did just a few moments ago he talked of course about his historic work with israel when he was in the white house and talked about his solidarity with israel in light of the attacks on october th he said that he pledged that when he returns to the white house will make every effort to bring peace to the middle east and combat antisemitism spreading throughout college campuses and across the united states of course theres a remarkable split screen like you said prime minister netanyahu really sort of hedging his bets meeting with president biden separately with vice president harris and now of course today there in florida at a lago meeting with former president trump yesterday we saw a big focus from this white house on that cease fire sort of hostage deal framework that is on the table the white house convinced that they can get that the finish line and vice president harris is sort of giving her own remarks to reporters was notable in her own remarks how much she talked about the suffering that the people in gaza have been feeling she talked about needing to find end to this war not only to secure the safety and security of israel but she also specifically mentioned about said that what happened what has been happening in gaza over the past nine months she said is devastating the images of dead children desperate hungry people fleeing for safety we cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and i will not be silent so clearly the focus here in washington and in florida the trump campaign back on israel as we take it you bring up a very interesting point there maryalice because not only is vice president harris in differentiating herself from her opponent and former president trump shes also kind of differentiating herself from president biden their very unique that she is in and you get this endorsement from the obamas not a surprise but they are very prominent and theyre very popular what does this mean for kamala harris i mean to that point its going to be so interesting to see if her campaign in any way starts to look or sound different from the biden campaign is there some daylight between how she talks about these major and her policy proposals and that of president biden a tricky balancing act she has to do right now where she is essentially now the new leader of the democratic party but also she has a pretty big day job she is the president biden is still her boss here at the white house so this is a moment for her but obviously an incredible opportunity its going to be very to see if the obamas actually go out and campaign with her they so powerful on the campaign trail harris is enjoying a lot of momentum right now she hasnt really had a struggle to gain sort of money donations new volunteers this first week of her candidacy but no doubt she will be hoping that the obamas join her out on the campaign because they can just be such a force with the democratic base it sounds like we not see her on the debate stage with former president trump whats he saying about shes really calling him out on this shes now sort of picking up his line shes saying anytime anywhere that shes ready bring it she said it is interesting that in the last few days it is trump that seems to be wavering of course he had agreed to that second debate with president biden against president biden our debate we hope that it still happens driver we want an abc debate but it is interesting that he is now sort of throwing cold water saying that democrats need to formally nominate her she needs to pick a vice president it seems like he is sort of walking it back look at the of the day i think these two will end up on a debate stage again i hope that it is hours but think these two will end up on a debate stage it is it is two sort of big and important in this in this election all right will we would certainly be prepared should they both agree to do that maryalice parks for us at the white house maryalice thank you very much always nice to talk to you meantime federal officials are hailing the arrest of two top leaders of the notorious mexican sinaloa drug cartel ismail zimbardo garcia also known as el myo and joaquin guzman lopez the son of infamous drug lord el chapo they are both now behind bars here in the us after they were taken into custody in paso texas attorney general merrick garland says the sinaloa is one of the most violent and powerful drug cartels in the world responsible for shipping thousands of pounds of cocaine methamphetamine and fentanyl into the us every day el myo appeared in court today in el paso pleaded not guilty we want to bring in people now abc news senior justice and homeland security reporter jack dougherty along with nbcs maria elena salinas and former assistant department homeland security secretary elizabeth neumann thank you all for being here jack give us the big here this was something that a security official says has been in the works for months so walk us through the details of how this all went down it appears to be an extraordinary ruse it looks like fbi and hhs agents thats the department of homeland securitys homeland secret investigations worked it out so that they would fly into an airport in texas the two cartel leaders one of them believe that they were going to be inspecting a clandestine runway in north mexico it ended up landing in texas however and when they got off the plane they walked into the arms of waiting fbi and cia agents that took them into custody its really quite extraordinary for them to have flown into the united states walking into that situation both taken into custody maria this is a notoriously brutal cartel and you have a situation here it seems a little was deceived by someone that he trusted how might those who are still inside the cartel respond to this well if in fact it is confirmed that joaquin guzman lopez the son of al chapo is the one who deceived him there could be backlash the family these are families that worked together for both el chapo and midas somebody its a family business where theyre siblings and theyre offsprings are involved and this could lead to a bloodbath the sinaloa cartel this very organized operation they have a line of succession and so whether its an internal battle for control of the cartel or a retaliation under suspicion that he was duped by the capitol you know we can expect violence and another interesting thing to note is that it was reported that oviedo guzman chapos other who has been incarcerated in the us since he was extradited mexico early last year he was released from prison it was reported that he was released but the mexican government denied it they claim that the us authorities said that they just made changes to his custody that for his own safety he was moved somewhere else and that move came before his brother in my assumption that was detained yesterday so its interesting very interesting elizabeth we learned that this happened without even mexican officials aware that this was going to happen here what do you make of the fbi deciding that they wanted to make these arrests on us soil rather than extraditing these individuals from mexico i mean it actually makes a ton of sense that this have been a huge victory for fbi agents theyve been tirelessly working to go after sinaloa they have are the the cause of hundreds of thousands of americans have died from fentanyl overdose that is directly tied to sinaloa sinaloa is for kind of creating the whole industry of synthetic fentanyl and moving it into the drug system so people often are taking fentanyl when they think theyre taking heroin or or other type of drug and so this is a mass of very violent very destructive organization and its a huge win to be able to to arrest these two and my guess is that look in the mexican government there its hard to know who to trust so it wouldnt be a safe operation to try to get the mexican government to arrest and then extradite its just much more secure to find a way to get them onto us soil and that appears to be what they have done quite successfully i imagine there are a lot of hacking people at doj today jack one of these men el maya has already made his initial appearance in el paso federal court he pleaded not where do we go from here well these men both have indictments theyre facing in multiple districts in the united states the justice department has a lot of cards in its hand and they can sort of played a number of ways they can do successive trials in each district or they can work with their best case first and they depending on what the sentencing is if theyre successful in getting a conviction there that might be enough and theyll theyll be able to make some judgments about how to their resources going forward but certainly they hold a lot of cards this point and a lot of serious charges faced by both men who could be looking at the rest of their lives in prison maria today as weve been covering this abc contributor and former federal prosecutor john katko described these arrests to me as a decapitation cartel leadership very strong words and they talked a lot about a power struggle do you see that these arrests weakening the grip that the cartel has on the us and its drug trade here i mean i dont know if its a total decapitation really i dont believe well see much change in the immediate because they are so wellorganized they have people leading divisions of the operation for example in my us but that was mostly charge of money laundering and government contacts based on some during el chapos trial in new york he testified there and he said that his father handed out about a month in bribes and its also been reported that somebody had been in contact with the dea for a couple of years possibly looking to negotiate a future deal where would turn himself in and they surely made a plan of succession then also but you know with so many of the leaders already in custody or dead its possible that less experi ance new leaders might weaken the organization those people that might not have as much as they do somebody has been in this business for four decades you know but even if that happens there are other cartels in mexico that are in line and ready to steal their business away maria elena salinas out and elizabeth newman big arrest today certainly not the end of the story we appreciate all three of you stopping by to talk with us and coming up here we have the latest on some coordinated arson attacks on train in france only hours before the olympic opening ceremonies we have the details coming up next whenever news breaks we are here in israel a nation at war after that brutal surprise attack by hamas on the ground in ukraine

that i met him a chill just like raced up through my spine i just shook the hand of a killer now stunning details she ends up revealing the biggest bombshell what will happen tonight at nine eight central on abc thank you for streaming with us to the olympic opening ceremonies are underway right now in paris but only hours ago french authorities say there was a massive coordinated attack on the countrys high speed train lines fires were set long three lines cables were cut well and this attack delayed trains at nearly every major station in paris is expected to impact at least people through this weekend and the delays also affected a separate which connects the uk to france we want to bring in abcs ines de la cuetara whos on the ground for us in paris so and thats an event like this the olympics there really isnt anything bigger than this you have so many people relying on these trains for transport whats the latest on getting everything repaired yeah trevor so officials are telling people that everything should be better by tomorrow so theyve spent all day really trying to restore service and they do think theres going to be a significant improvement by tomorrow they had said that it would last through monday but it does appear like most train service will be restored by tomorrow so thats the good news the bad news of course being that this happened at all just on the eve of the olympics found out about it this morning early in the morning so it happened overnight this this massive arson attack what officials are calling a coordinated they say this was meant to disrupt the olympics that it specifically targeting high speed rail line so like you say a number of lines including the eurostar from london to paris over hundred thousand passengers affected and so this is having real impact on you know the number of people trying to get to paris in for the games in time for the opening ceremony youre there in paris whats security like yes i mean security is is everywhere we know officials have certainly ramped up security measures because of concerns of you know the bad actors could try to take advantage of the situation considering everything thats going on in the world right now you cant go anywhere in paris at the moment without into some sort of security checkpoint or your security presence there about officers whove been deployed just for tonight just for the opening ceremony an additional members of the military there have been other officers from forces from around the world whove come in to lend a hand the airspace over paris is also been closed so no flights taking off or landing in paris because of the opening ceremony i will say it is really coming down at the moment so raining so in terms of the numbers of people attending the opening ceremony it was expected to be about that number is probably a little smaller because of the rain i think some people are probably heading home a bit earlier than planned but for the most part people are powering through with their umbrellas with their ponchos but the rain certainly really coming down and ines de la cuetara for us in paris it is thank you very much meantime back here in the us an official autopsy report today confirmed the death of sonia massey was indeed a homicide yearold black woman she died of a gunshot wound to the head after was shot by police inside her own apartment and officials say the mother of two called to report a suspicious before things escalated i want to warn you the video of the body camera footage may be difficult to watch for perhaps your heart even water is in the water yeah got a neighbor said i feel better now after how hot hot cross and shot fired shots fired shots fired police quickly fired that officer who pulled the trigger deputy sean grayson he was then indicted for first degree murder and aggravated battery today the family calling for even more accountability they want justice for sonya massey they told me that theyre going to go there to help her and then this happens again so she was seeking help she needed a helping hand not a bullet to the i want to bring in abc news contributor and former nypd of detectives robert boyce bob thanks so much for being here broadly seeing that video and knowing how the police department responded firing this deputy issuing an apology whats your response to how this has played out far well trevor now were going to look like look at how was hired and the hiring practices and policies of that sheriffs office and thats important to look at and theres three things youre going to look at you go look how does it conduct employment history and anything that the past psychological testing all does this has gone on throughout the entire united states and every police department what did we say what should we have known and youre going to do what even deeper dive he didnt turn on his body worn camera you go back to other cases and see if theres anything more there that you could have done better someone could supervise this better because ill tell you this is a tactical its a training failure and just everything just went wrong this is slight one she could have been contained easily and not let about the apartment like this so we see everything thats gone wrong in this this is not enforcement this is not what i know because we handle these things i say hundreds of times that thousand times day across the country this is an abject failure you make a very interesting there bob because i know that you said earlier when we were talking about this that this officers conduct in response is against everything that cops are taught but theres also a lot of missed red flags too does this appear to be part of a systemic issue do you think this a one off or something slipped through the cracks i its its important to understand that why one of these things is this discharge from the army wasnt it looked like more the two duis they took in and we pled guilty to them and also the fact that he went to all these police departments even though was time it was a two year gap between the last one burden placed forward and the saying among those two that what was he doing that time so these these convicts have to be take a look at and yet generally speaking theres a lot of dismissals before you even get to being in a place like this so this is surprising yet theres something more than what were seeing right now it seems there is and what youre referencing six jobs with the police in four years robert boyce thank you very much for your time nice to speak with you always and coming up the latest on the fbi investigation into the assassination attempt of former president donald trump we have the details next what

vice president kamala harris brings in another major endorsement hi everyone im trevor ault our top story at this hour the massive wildfires that are burning out of control in the west more than wildfires are burning across california and utah torching hundreds of thousands of acres and forcing thousands of evacuations the park fire in northern california alone has burned more than acres it is the states biggest wildfire of the year authorities say this was arson and the suspect is under arrest abcs jaclyn lee joins me now chico california which is about miles north of sacramento jacqueline whats the latest here on the park fire what are firefighters there telling you on the ground thats right so first off i mean were still sitting on more acres burned and its not contained at point whatsoever so what were seeing here at base camp is these firefighters are going in shifts so were seeing those who are working for the last hours on the front lines they are part of the strike teams that mobilized when the fire broke out they are now returning theyre getting food some rest before they have to go back out again now were also seeing all across the state theres different fire crews different battalions coming up from all over even far down from southern california theyre coming up to let these guys get a rest but were also hearing is that these fire crews are coming from other fires throughout the state and they are considered fresh when arrive here at base camp then theyre sent back out to the park fire so were just seeing a number of firefighters just going these revolving shifts trevor and we see that movement behind you jacqueline stick around because were going to come back to you but we do want to also bring in cal fire battalion chief david acuna who is with us now so chief you so much for being here we know this fire really exploded in size in a pretty short time how much of a factor is the weather here both in the spread of the fire and also in how its impacting the firefighters efforts to get it contained naturally it absolutely is significant issue to have such hot weather with the winds and jacqueline made an interesting point she said that when firefighters arrive they are considered fresh one thing we have to consider though that with firefighter fatigue these firefighters been fighting wildland fire since the end of may nearly consistently perhaps they get home not its just such a challenge for all the firefighters for how long theyve been out on the road what is the key to keeping them fresh and keeping safe we do make sure that we wrote in and we are work rest cycles and ensuring that we have sufficient numbers of firefighters on scene for the incidents in order to make sure that they get their time off there are so many incidents right now sometimes they are stretched thin but we do our best to give them work rest cycle as we can you say you have enough firefighters do you need more we can always use more and thats where thankfully we have partnerships with our local government agencies with our federal agencies and using the coordination centers that are run by both cal fire and the federal system were able to send firefighters where they need to go at the right time some of that teamwork in action behind so jaclyn youve mentioned this before in your reporting but what is the latest on the air quality with all this smoke in the air right drivers you have to think about as this fire continues to grow size youre seeing i dont know if you can actually see it but theres a huge plume of smoke thats billowing up into the air and obviously when you have conditions this when its very windy when its very hot and you have multiple fires burning throughout the state and were also seeing it other in other states all of the wind is going to be spreading this around so that makes very dangerous conditions for residents so of course officials are warning residents you want to put on those you want to think about your lungs so the air quality is not great here at base camp though its not too bad because we are a little bit away from the fire okay well we hope it stays that way jaclyn lee for us in chico and cal fire chief david acuna thank you both for your time i had two politics now and the israeli prime minister is covering all his bases his trip to the united states benjamin benjamin netanyahu is visiting former president donald trump at maralago today that trip to florida comes just one day after netanyahu met separately with vice president kamala and president biden in washington at the same time vice president is picking up a pretty high profile endorsement from the obamas as democrats continue to get behind her in the wake of bidens decision to leave the race im joined now by white house correspondent alice parks whos there at the white house for us and maryalice what do we know with netanyahu and his trip hes got this meeting with the former president have we learned anything about that meeting so far seems like they sat down for lunch there in mar a lago some ominous words from the former president to reporters in room saying that if he wasnt elected there would be more wars throughout world of course you know we have seen him supporting israel in the most sort of the strictest strongest terms but thats very similar language to what we yesterday from president biden this is an interesting split screen because of course former president trump is a former and the current president is actively involved in these negotiations to try to bring an end to the war right now not talking in hypotheticals but talking in terms of the negotiating table that is very much alive active you know we heard president biden and the white house talking about how they believed a ceasefire deal was was achievable that the gaps were close the ball that they were within arms reach and you know the white house really focused on sure that that hostage deal gets over the finish line so interesting to see sort of the white house working while trump is still doing his own shadow diplomacy obviously to get back to the white house but president biden hoping this war is over and they are in a phase of sort of rebuilding gaza figuring out what comes after this war well before the elections in november and of course before january looking at the campaign maryalice the former presidents running mate senator jd vance has been catching a lot of flack hes now catching some more flack today another old interview surfaced this time with him advocating for higher taxes on america who dont have children how is he responding to that today i mean hes basically said that those comments were taken out of context people are making too much out of it but he does sort of double down on this idea that he thinks that democrats have become too antifamily that are the family that sort of the party of families i can tell you that theres a lot of democrats here at the white house who would of course strongly push back against that notion democrats say that they are the party that has pitched universal prek and paid family leave and raised the minimum wage so i think that at some point senator vance and the republican ticket is going to have talk about policy proposals that they are backing be sort of the party of the family but look those are national perspective here in dc we get wonky really fast but on the campaign trail those comments arent sitting well theyre not sitting well with independent women theyre not well of course with the democratic base i think if anything theyre rallying even people in the democratic party to kamala harris aside but but theyre even conservative women i think really frustrated when theyre seeing some of these old clips surfaced this is not not what the republicans right now its not the message they want to be sending this is a moment where they were hoping to really solidify and unify the republican party bring some of those conservative women who frankly had been put off in past elections trump and by former president trumps sort of language around women they wanted to bring them back into the fold they dont need these sort of comments right now and this is going to be tough and the republicans know that they are playing cleanup we did today whats likely the last major democratic endorsement the form of the obamas backing vice president kamala harris for president not really a surprise in any context took maybe a couple of days after a few other major endorsements but what does this mean for her campaign its not a huge surprise whats going to matter is if they go out and campaign for her these are two of the most effective campaigners in the democratic party they bring in so much money people come from all over to see them they can be such a force out on the campaign trail theyre just incredibly popular and so i think its going to make a really big difference if we see out hitting the trail on her behalf you know michelle obama and chooses when she goes out does not do it very often i think that thats really what well be looking for thats really what could make a difference frankly the vice president has proven in the last week that doesnt need a lot of help raising money shes been just sort of these these numbers that her campaign are bringing in their eye popping just of record shattering but these endorsements dont hurt they they are good for the democratic base obviously exciting for her campaign she is feeling all the love and a lot of momentum right now yeah and they certainly want to capitalize on all that momentum maryalice parks for us the white house thank you very much meantime federal officials are hailing the arrest of two top leaders of the notorious mexican sinaloa drug cartel it smells and body garcia also known as el myo joaquin guzman lopez son of infamous drug lord el chapo they are both now behind bars here in the us after they were taken into custody in el paso texas attorney general merrick garland says cartel is one of the most violent and powerful drug cartels in the world responsible for shipping thousands of pounds of cocaine methamphetamines and fentanyl into the us every day el mayo already appeared in federal court today in el paso pleading not guilty we want to bring abc news senior justice and homeland security reporter jack today for more along with abc news contributor and former federal prosecutor john katko thank you both for being here jack lets start with you so what are you hearing from your sources about how this went down i would imagine this is something that took a great of planning given how significant these two men are absolutely it was a carefully orchestrated operation fbi and agents from the department of homeland security homeland security investigations orchestrated a way for these two drug cartel leaders to basically fly themselves into texas mayo we believe but thought that he was actually flying to inspect an airstrip a clandestine airstrip northern mexico he ended up landing in texas and was greeted by agents from the fbi and cia and put into custody along with el chapos son one of the four sons that had been part of the leadership the sinaloa cartel so both men are in custody as you mentioned mayo appeared earlier today in texas and were awaiting the appearance of of of of guzman john i believe you were a federal prosecutor right there in el paso put this in historical context for us as to what this what these arrests mean and also how something like this unfold the planning to make sure that it happens yeah well first of all i did those cases in el paso going after cartels and this is a very big deal that they were able to get probably the largest cartels leadership and decapitate them by luring them into the united states so this takes a lot of planning takes a lot of probably cooperating on both sides of the border theres a million reward for the capture people are enticed by that and they came across the border and they got them and whats really important this is its supremely disruptive to the sinaloa cartel which is probably the one of the biggest in the world and now theres a power and now the cartel in rolling fork this tornadotore through this town from lewiston maine a scene of ahorrific mass shooting from the scene

news on abc news live thank you for streaming with us just hours before the opening ceremony of olympics in paris french authorities say there was a massive coordinate attack on the countrys high speed train lines fires were set along three lines cables were cut and this attack delayed trains at nearly every major station in paris it impacted at least people throughout the weekend those delays are also affecting a train which connects the uk to france we want to get more on this were bringing in abcs and as the look with tara whos reporting for us from paris so intense what is the latest here on this attack on the train lines what are officials telling about how long it might take to get a repair hey trevor yeah that was really the big story today on the security front was massive arson attack on the french railway network according to the french railway company sncf theyre calling this a coordinated attack they say that fires were set at a number of railway stations around the country that cables were cut in some cases and they say that the attackers here were specifically high speed railway lines so like you mentioned the eurostar from london to paris was affected they believe that about passengers have been impacted people who were trying get to the olympics trying to get to paris in time for the opening ceremonies initially these these officials had said that you know these these issues could run through monday we did hear from them a few ago and they did say that things were slightly improving so theyve been working it all day and they do expect some significant improvements by tomorrow youre quoting them when you call this a coordinated attack and as they are not calling this terrorism right now are they saying anything about potential suspects no word yet on the potential suspect like you say it is significant that theyre not calling it terrorism i think thats the big concern here you know officials here have certainly ramped up security measures ahead of the olympics the fear being that you know with everything going on in the world there could be bad actors taking advantage of the situation this is this ones not being called a terror attack and they havent said anything as to you know who could be behind this we assume its a group of people considering you know there were a number of different attacks at different train stations around the country but still no word on who could be behind this i will say officials in recent days and weeks have been arresting a number of kind of suspects there was a russian man arrested earlier this week who was being accused of of trying to destabilize the olympics they didnt say just how he was planning to do that he is believed to have been a russian spy so you know thats just one example of of one case of someone theyve arrested who was trying to sow discord here at the olympics very interesting to see this happen given the gigantic security footprint there in paris and as the local terror thank you very much ines meantime back here at home an official autopsy report today confirmed the death of sonia massey was indeed a homicide soni massey a year old black woman who died of a gunshot wound to the head after was shot by police inside her own apartment and officials say the mother of two called herself to report suspicious person before things escalated and we want to warn you the video may be difficult to watch for us what youre seeing in water away from us in the water yeah i refuse to go to neighborhoods i feel sorry for how she died got cross been shot fired shots fired shots cars so the police department quickly fired the officer who pulled the deputy sean grayson he was then indicted for first degree murder and aggravated battery today the family of massey calls for more accountability and justice they told me that they were going to go there to help her and then this happens here so she was seeking help she needed a helping hand not a bullet to the face and i want to bring in former nypd detective claxton marc thank you so much for being here before we get to the more specific questions i would just like to hear your reaction upon seeing that body camera video of what happened it really is a shocking display of a lack of humanity by the former deputy president and to see this mess he laid on the ground afterwards on the floor dying and it really demonstrated that she had an of the level of evil that was before her in the form of deputy grayson which is why she probably uttered those words i rebuke unit aim of satan but it just disturbing and tragically just too familiar weve here before and im afraid that unless theres significant change and shift away from the current these incidents are not merely lapses tactical lapses or simple or mere tragedies its an unavoidable outcome of a structurally deficient outdated policing model which too often is fed by implicit bias and overt overreliance on the use of force it fails to prioritize basic public service even when responding to as in this case calls for assistance from the public and unfortunate without a significant structural change the well be back here again having the same conversation after this shooting happened the deputy was fired the police department issued an apology but we did also hear allegations from sonia massies family police did not initially tell them who shot whenever news breaks we arehere in israel a nation at war in rolling fork this tornadotore through this town from lewiston maine a scene of ahorrific mass shooting

meets with prime minister benjamin netanyahu moreamericans turn to world news tonight with david muir themostwatched news cast on television its a startling accusation many law enforcement agencies suggesting the busy lax airport may be on its way to becoming a drug gateway gio unbelievable could the plane youre flying in on be carrying illegal drugs more now from kabcs david ono reporter lax millions of people travel through here every year another workers per day and you have an enormous complicated ecosystem amidst all this energy is a massive problem building for years and nobody is talking about it listen to me folks reporter except for a sheriff miles away as a herd of cattle bask in the sun outside of his office longtime florida sheriff grady jugg delivers a sobering message on these domestic airlines at lax through suitcases drugs were smuggled here look at this reporter through good police work sheriff judd cracks an enormous drug ring in his own special way he illustrates the problem on one occasion one airline six prosesuitcases with this drs smuggled into orlando they didnt so much as throw a pair of underwear in the suitcase to act like they were hiding the drugs you think lax has got a drug smuggling problem reporter according to multiple law enforcement sources lax likely is the drug trafficking hub of the world this isnt los angeles problem its everyones including polk county florida whos responsible for stopping it our search authority is very narrow we search for weapons incendiaries and explosives we want to keep those off planes reporter this man is the head of tsa at lax how does searching for drugs play into the tsa we dont search for narcotics as i said we search for weapons incendiaries and explosives reporter he says lax is the busiest origination and destination airport of the world they deal with hundreds of thousands of bags and people a day he says searching for drugs cannot be part of their job dont have the ability to do that because were not law enforcement officials were transportation security officers we cant search for criminal activity its not within what were able to do with our search authority reporter understand that most bags are examined by tsa but it may not be what you think theres a screening process we all walk through to get on a plane through xrays tsa looks inside our carryons then theres the bags we check in those go through an explosive detection system its not like an xray machine where an officer is looking at each bag reporter theres no human looking inside if the machine doesnt detect explosives the bag keeps moving there are occasions the tsa finds drugs the first thing we do is notify law enforcement reporter that law enforcement is lax pd any crimes committed on the property we investigate those crimes we also make sure the airport is secure reporter lax pd chief cecil rambo has a long list of responsibilities from check points to thefts to assaults to parking violations and illegally trafficked jobs looking through the bags are not their jobs are bags your responsibility no bags are tsa i have a team of agents assigned to lax reporter maltthew allen is the dea agent assigned to la a lot of what they do is investigative they try to stop the narcotics before they make it to lax if theyre not going to look at the bags when it comes to drugs then who should be we all have our roles to play screening is not the role of the dea as a general rule if theres a call out for drugs at the airport my team would not respond we respond to very specific types of drug incidents at the airport reporter david gates is with the fbi when it comes to drugs at lax they respond to t crimes when airport employees try to use credentials to sneak drugs past check points or if illegal drugs are found in the cabin of the plane but only if the doors have been shut if theyre open thats lax pd its complicated its complicated because this airport is so complicated we have approximately special agents that reside there on a daily basis reporter this man with homeland security says they have an army of agents at lax hoping to crack international drug cases like the dea their priority is investigation they dont search through the massive bags either it seems to be a gray area on whos in charge of stopping drugs from going through lax i think all the agencies that work there have a great working relationship one of the main issues is volume reporter you see the problem everyone is doing their job and doing it well but it seems no entity is actually responsible for searching all those bags for drugs even the dogs at the airport the majority are searching for explosives not drugs the cartels figured all this out years ago thats why we no longer see cessnas delivering drugs to secret air strips weve not seen a small airplane fly into a clandestine strip in decades the infrastructures already in place the drug dealers dont have to create the infrastructure its here eva just ahead the critical role our pets play in our lives gio were going to meet the folks in utah behind an effort to keep families what does it take to be the most watched

anxiety paired with traditional talk therapy for jess it was years of other therapies until she found relief through ketamine intravenous ketamine was approved for use as an anesthetic years ago doctors use this form of ketamine legally through a process called offlabel prescribing who is coming here mostly treatmentresistant people who have been on years of psychiatric treatment and they

after ketamine therapy one of the things regrowing are the integrity of the inputs to a nerve cell the regrowth of those synapses eva ketamine appears to work on a cellular level like all medication ketamine is not for everyone the longterm effects as well as the ideal dosing and treatment frequency are still being studied theres a risk ketamine could induce a psychotic episode in certain patients people who have the diagnosis of schizophrenia so far we would not recommend there are people who are developing a psychiatric illness we would typically not treat with ketamine just in case they have a vulnerability to schizophrenia eva dr crystal claims for those who can use ketamine a high percentage of patients see remission after just one session and many more may see relief with occasional maintenance doses i think of ketamine as an ver ve intervention that is part of an overall treatment it can facilitate and enhance the impact of psychotherapy which people will get oftentimes when theyre getting ketamine treatments you think theres a lot of hope to come we have to be patient about how these transformative new insights into the brain translate into achievement im hopeful how different is your life now than when you first started this journey its much freer i feel freer its something everyone should feel i wanted to heal to feel better for one but also to show

sparking the fire and benjamin meeting with donald trump at maralago one day after sitting down with president biden and vice president harris how trump is now ramping up his attacks on the vice president plus the daring operation to capture two alleged top leaders of the notorious sinaloa drug cartel including el chapo son how the justice department says a senior cartel member tricked them into flying onto us soil we start with a western wildfire emergency in what is now californias largest fire this year officials say that park fire was caused by arson burning more than acres with containment so far homes engulfed in flames tanks exploding the rapid fire wildfire has destroyed hundreds of structures becoming a major threat to the of chico california more than emergency responders are working to fight and contain the flames and authorities now have a suspect in custody on suspicion of arson yearold ronnie dean stout is accused of igniting the fire by pushing a burning car a gulley in bidwell park our abc news jaclyn lee joins us now live from chico california jaclyn give us a picture of what you are seeing where you are now we know that this is the largest fire california right now thats right elizabeth and actually fire continue to grow in size it is now more than acres burning which is about acres an hour that are burning and so behind me you can see this plume of smoke has continued to grow over the last few hours just kind of matching the growth of the fire which obviously is creating air quality concerns but it just kind of points the picture of how rapidly the fire is growing its creating very difficult conditions for not only firefighters but also residents just some updated numbers for you there are at least structures destroyed in butte county and are more than structures that are currently being threatened of its a very scary situation for a lot of people here on the ground and theyre just how dangerous the environment is given the it is extremely extremely hot and given the wind and when you combine that with low humidity you just have a true pressure cooker here elizabeth and you can really see that smoke plume right behind you jaclyn what are you hearing from crews about the containment of the wildfire and what theyre up against right now with contained and so were here at base camp and this is where the firefighters have been coming in all morning for the guys who are the guys and gals who are going out to the front lines also the ones who have been fighting the fire for some of them theyve been fighting for the last hours the shifts are typically hours but for those firefighters that were part of that initial push out some of them have been there for hours so theyve been coming back just to some rest to get some supplies and get some food we spoke with some firefighters who talked about speaking with residents who are dealing with a very scary situations with their homes take a listen when youre on the front lines are you seeing were seeing i mean its of fire extreme fire behavior its very hot were seeing a lot of civilians who are scared for their homes theyre trying to do what they can to save their homes and they want you to help their own and of course firefighters say their number one priority is safety the residents and of course safety for themselves as well no question that we know that this virus spread to parts of the forest that havent in decades jaclyn what else can you tell us about this investigation into suspected arson right so as you had mentioned ronnie stout is the suspect he has not been arraigned yet and we spoke with the peer of cal fire who said that charges are pending just because the fire is still burning so of course if anyone dies as a result of this that could be added charges later on elizabeth jaclyn lee thanks for staying this for us appreciate you we turn now to the race for white house former president trump sitting down with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in florida this morning for the first time since trump saying after the meeting that he has a working relationship with netanyahu the former president also took the opportunity to ramp up his attacks on his new political opponent vice president kamala harris shes a radical left person san francisco destroyed san francisco shes really a destroyer she doesnt know how to build and i think her remarks disrespectful they werent very nice pertaining to israel trump to back out of a debate with vice president harris his stating it would be inappropriate to schedule because democrats very well could still change their minds in response harris posting on asks what happened to any time any place harris meantime did score another big endorsement today from president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama lets bring in abc news senior white house correspondent selina wang talk to us about the significance of this endorsement from the obamas today yeah this is a big deal elizabeth i mean these are some of the biggest democrat heavyweights and with them putting their weight behind harris and their vice president kamala harris has now virtually gotten the publics of every leading figure in the democratic party and this is now just her wrapping up the first week of her on the campaign trail and her campaign has really been operating at warp speed they know they have a lot to accomplish and a very small amount of time tomorrow marks just days until the election and so youve seen her criss crossing across the country trying to spread her message trying to reintroduce herself to the american people but look her campaign also knows that right now were in this great honeymoon phase where youre seeing a lot of grassroots endorsements lot of money being raised constantly hitting record amounts of fund raising but they know that the path ahead is still going to be tough that shes energized the base of voters that she still needs to reach out to those critical independent voters in those swing states and pretty remarkable to see how quickly shes gathered all of that support just in less than a week celine as you say days until the election time running out already too to pick a running mate what are we hearing as far as the potential pixar right now yeah the clock is ticking and i was just checking with in with my campaign sources they tell me she is still at a pool of about a dozen candidates and that she wants to make this decision by august seven so the clock here is really down and she has to do a lot of vetting im told that this vetting process is already underway they want to scour all of these peoples backgrounds they dont want to find any piece of information that could jeopardize her her candidacy im also told that shes looking for someone has similar values as her and someone who is ready to be a governing partner and who is ready to go on day one but as you say tomorrow that day mark until election day and the campaign is making a full push with thousands of events across those battleground states and also you have governor shapiro and whitmer on monday theyre going to be campaigning together for harris in battleground pennsylvania both of them of course considered to be possible running mates to vice president process that normally takes months condensed into weeks thank you one of two alleged top leaders of the notorious sinaloa drug cartel captured in a daring crossborder operation pleading not guilty in court in texas today justice department officials say they caught ismael el males and barta along with joaquin guzman lopez the son of infamous drug kingpin el chapo by luring them across the border from mexico in a private plane somebody is accused of flooding america with fentanyl evading authorities the us and mexico for decades us law enforcement officials say his arrest along with the arrest of el chapo son seen is an enormous blow to the cartel heres attorney general maria garland the justice department will rest until every single cartel leader member and associate responsible for poisoning communities is held accountable abcs justice and homeland security reporter jack today is tracking all of this from here in washington jack pretty remarkable sequence of events what do we know about this high stakes operation and kind of the play by play of how this happened well sources are telling us it looks like it was an extraordinary ruse that somehow the fbi and homeland security investigations were able to lure both men both top leaders of the sinaloa cartel into the united states to texas and sources are telling us that ismael el somebody believe he was going to north mexico to inspect that clandestine runway but when they landed they were the united states of america in texas and when they got off the plane they were in the custody of us federal agency fbi and cia agents and now theyre facing charges both men indicted in several districts in the united states both face lengthy prison sentences crazy to see those images on the tarmac there jack attorney general garland made very clear the devastating impact that fentanyl has had on the us on so many households do you think theres any chance these arrests could lead to a power struggle potentially more violence then within the sinaloa cartel it could lead to some disruptions in the leadership but make no mistake this is a multibillion dollar business enterprise it has tentacles that run into all states the united states its a operation and theres a lot of money at stake and new leadership will step up to claim that money to make sure they have a piece of it a new power struggle already brewing im sure jack doubt thank you so much venezuela gearing up for a high stakes election this weekend voters are set to cast ballots on sunday and what political analysts say could be the countrys most important election in a decade venezuelas president nicolas maduro vying for a third term in office he is facing nine opposition candidates who are seeking to convince venezuelans that they can undo maduros policies blamed for economic widespread violence and mass emigration from the country maduros biggest challenge comes from former diplomat gonzalez who is backed by opposition leader maria machado shes a former lawmaker barred from running for president herself and has rallied millions of venezuelans to vote maduro for more on this election and what is at stake lets in abc news contributor maria elena salinas maria and i thank you so much for here on a friday give us a picture of what some of the concerns are in this election driving voters to the polls and is a chance that edwin gonzalez could beat maduro well you know this is a very high stakes election in venezuela possibly the most in recent history maduro has been in power for years but the ideology known as talisman has been there for years maduro was the handpicked successor of former president hugo chavez after his death in but since then country has faced deterioration of the economy the health system of the is in shambles and the social fabric of the country has been completely unraveled violence really has taken thousands and thousands of lives and people have lost their liberties so is one of the reasons why an estimated to million venezuelans have fled the country the majority of them are spread in different countries in south america colombia ecuador chile and argentina and its estimated that around million have come to the us and theyre tired of the turmoil that they just might turn on the current government and could gonzalez beat maduro well know theres ten candidates in total but the majority of the opposition is behind gonzalez in one poll he had of the vote question if nicolas maduro will allow the opposition to win since his government controls practically all of the institutions in the country that was my next question for you how do we know maduro would exit if the results didnt show that he lost and is that is there a chance that he could cast doubt on the results now well thats a good question because i dont believe that maduro is counting on losing he has said in recent days that if they lose that it could be a bloodbath and he has a stronghold on the military and he just claimed recently that the military in venezuela chavista and that will defend his regime you know if he were to lose i cant imagine that he can stay in the country and become opposition theres just too much bad blood between him and the opposition although weve seen it in other countries where they come to some kind of peace agreement or some kind of pact you know people can and probably will go out on the streets to protest if they feel there has been fraud they have done it in the past and they have faced the violent crackdowns not just from the military but from armed civilians sympathetic to maduro regime so if he loses the only way the country could move forward is if the military turns on him but either way its not expected to be a very peaceful transition of power wow and there is as you point out growing frustration venezuela a majority of venezuelans say they are struggling to afford food they dont feel safe what would a new leader mean would it bring it could it bring some security to this region that has just been embroiled in that turmoil for years well a new leader would definitely mean hope for the venezuelan people you know the challenge would be to rebuild their economy their health system to control the violence that has been rampant for so many years and also for those of us for those of them that still do support maduro and are still considered chavistas you know that would be a challenge also to bring them their side you know for those who have fled the country i think what this means for them is returning to their homeland have left because of the dire situation that they were facing in their own country and for the region you know i think a lot of countries have been affected i know that we complain in the us that there are so many venezuelans coming here and that they have all come here but thats not true only maybe million out of the million that have left have come here and they have tried to establish themselves other countries you know were talking about millions as i mentioned before its between seven and million and thats almost one fourth of the population of the country and the great majority are our neighboring countries so i think it would mean you know more peace for for the region and definitely hope for the people of venezuela that at least little by little they are able to rebuild that country that has been devastated by years of terrorism one fourth of the population leaving that is just remarkable maria elena i always appreciate thank you so much thank you coming the city of paris kicking off the olympic games coordinated arson attacks though

ceremonies featuring some stunning performances including lady gaga floating down the sand river other showcasing athletes and representatives from countries from all around the world including of course team usa led by flagbearers lebron james and coco gauff also there to represent the united states with snoop dogg carrying the olympic flame through a paris suburb all of this just hours after france suffered a massive coordinated attack on the countrys high speed train lines fires set along three lines and cables were cut that attack delayed trains nearly every major station in paris affecting hundreds of thousands of people in france and in the uk for more on all of this lets bring in abcs ines de la cuetara who is in paris and set the scene for us a little bit there just tell us what its like in paris now that the games are officially hey elizabeth yeah and a historic night here in paris this was the first time in olympic history that the opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium you had those boats carrying different delegations some delegations were sharing a boat other delegations had their own boat like team usa and they were sailing down the sand past all of these iconic landmarks the eiffel tower the notredame cathedral the louvre museum you had all sorts of performances alongside that acrobats dancers on the on the banks of the river on the on the bridges some on individual little platforms in the middle of the said so really a remarkable sight i will say the though was that it did start pouring you know a few minutes into the opening ceremony and so that kind of put a damper on things here we headed out to kind of watch it for ourselves and people were soaked you know weird and umbrellas everywhere and those that didnt have that were totally soaked so that was a little bit of a but you did have you know crowds still powering through wanting to see this historic night the athletes the performers power their people made it all the way there a little rain wasnt going to stop them right so we know that and as the airspace around paris closed during the opening ceremonies this was a safeguard authorities had planned prior to those arson attacks but how are french handling security given what we saw this morning what are they doing going forward now yes security was certainly a big concern is going to be a concern going forward because of how ambitious these games are so you have the opening ceremony being held outside of the stadium but you also have all these different events that are going to be held at different venues around paris so you know theres going to be for instance beach volleyball is going to be held at the eiffel tower youre going to have all the horseback riding held at the baci chateau and so thats going to make extra challenging for security officials its going to be hard ensure that everything unfolds really smoothly so when it comes the opening ceremony they had deployed police officers just for the opening ceremony an additional members of the military like you say the airspace paris was closed there were no airplanes taking off or landing flying overhead and so far everything has has gone pretty smoothly so they do seem to have pulled it off which is quite a feat and then well have to see going forward you know like i say these different events being held at different iconic landmarks paris that is also going to be a challenge but yeah these arson attacks that we found out about early this morning were certainly alarming was you know as officials called it a massive coordinated attack was targeting different railway stations around the country they i think that it was specifically targeting high speed rail lines over passengers affected officials did say are hoping that train traffic will start to improve by tomorrow yeah big implications from that and is what are you going to see this weekend youre going to see any of the games i just found out actually today that i do have access to all of the competitions that is very exciting i wasnt aware so yes i will try and catch you know hopefully maybe some gymnastics some swimming some horseback riding i grew up horseback riding so well see if i have time but yes very much looking forward to it the perks of the job there you go and as tara thank you so much and enjoy were going to turn now coming up

life youre watching americas one streaming news keep streaming with abc news live campaign heating up as vice president kamala harris rallies supporters and donald trump steps up his attacks im elizabeth schulze washington in todays big story trump meeting today with israeli minister benjamin netanyahu at mar a lago how the former president after the vice president plus how she has drawn the endorsement of one of the few high profile democrats who hadnt factor yet ill speak with our senior white house correspondent selina wang and in our spotlight wall street is rallying in response to some positive new economic numbers our panel weighs in on how family finances could impact the race for the white house we begin with our big story the race the white house israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu was in florida this morning sitting down with former president donald trump for the first time since trump saying after the meeting has a good working relationship with netanyahu former president took the opportunity to ramp up his attacks on his new political vice president kamala harris trumpeter pier two back out of a debate with harris his campaign stating it would be inappropriate to schedule because democrats very well could still change their minds in response harris posting on what happened to any time any place meantime harris scored another big endorsement today from former president barack obama and former first lady michelle obama so lets go to our abc news senior white correspondent selina wang celina talk a little bit about this endorsement from the obamas of course we know that right after president biden stepped aside which hard to believe was just five days ago we didnt hear this obama do you make anything of the timing of this coming out today yeah look he was one of the later holdouts but i dont think we should make too much of timing i have been told that he wanted to let the process play out a little bit before he threw his full weight behind vice president harris but that is very much what were seeing today and it coincides with the timing with this election just days away starting tomorrow exactly days away but elizabeth now with the obamas back vice president harris she now pretty much has the support of every single leading figure inside the democratic party it is with rapid that she has coalesced and united this party and we have seen her hit four states in four days she knows she needs to campaign quickly hard and aggressively to reach this timeline this is an unprecedented situation of how much work they have to do in such a short period of time but the campaign also knows that we are still in a honeymoon period and they have a lot work ahead of him them and that this is going to be a very tight race of course vice president harris is energizing the democratic base but theyve got to reach those critical swing voters in those battleground to win this election its about days to go as you said we did hear in an interview afternoon that trumps running mate senator jd vance kind of standing by those past comments he called top democrats vice president harris a few years back a childless cat what was behind vances comments today and what are we hearing in response from the harris campaign on this yeah look vance is coming across a lot of blowback because of comments made in the past several comments he made about women and families you mentioned the one about childless ladies that one has gone viral and in fact youve heard folks like actress jennifer aniston and the exwife of doug emhoff vice president kamala harris husband come out in her defense then in those new comments that were surfaced today by abc news first vance is saying that behavior should be rewarded by the country and bad behavior should punished then he went on to say that those with children should be taxed at a lower tax rate and those without children be taxed at a higher tax rate those comments are not over so well and that comes on top of comments that vance had made before in the past suggesting that those with children should get more votes and elections now the harris campaign obviously is pouncing on all these comments to them they believe this shows how the republicans and trump advance want to take away rights from women want to control aspects of their life in their bodies of course they have also been attacking him on his record on abortion while the harris campaign is framing their message around this concept of freedom freedom to decide what to do with your body freedom to not just get by but to get ahead that really one of their key taglines elizabeth and those campaigning in those taglines we will hear much more of in the next few days and weeks selina wang thank you so much lets this big story to our panel joining us today is abc news contributor and sirius xm radio host mike muse democratic strategist cai von shroff and abc news contributor and former republican congresswoman from virginia barbara happy friday to all of you great to have you here today barbara i actually want to start with you with what we were just talking about with selina and this get your take on jd vance his comments that the democratic party is antifa and those comments about childless cat ladies we see these comments resurfacing did the trump campaign miscalculate here a little bit in choosing him did they not do enough vetting on this i mean theres just been organic outrage i miss you know how you know how people decide whether going to have children or not whether by chance or choice i mean he has just opened a firestorm on this and you know this is you know women whether its dali or jennifer aniston or you know taylor swift you know when women decide to have or if they can have children is none of his business and for him to you know sit there and decide you know certainly theres men who dont have children there are men in congress who dont have children is he picking on them no its just women and i would point out you know some of the fox hosts says that he is speaking to many of them dont have women who have children either theyre very successful i dont they find their lives miserable because they havent had children no they have opened up a whole can of worms here and i that theme of freedom that beautiful that the vice president has put out in really what has been a flawless rollout this week really has tapped into that whole you know outrage that you know that the misogyny thats coming from team trump that we saw last week at the convention but really has come from a lot of these comments from jd vance too yeah who knew we would be having this conversation here on this friday night i mean talk about this momentum seen behind harris obviously she got this big endorsement from the obamas today pretty crazy to think about that less than a week ago this was still race between president biden and trump what does it say you that shes been able to take this messaging you know take this message of that barbara was talking about and really kind of consolidate her support so quickly here i think a couple of things at play i think in her initial statement after receiving the endorsement president biden on that sunday she said shes very thankful for the endorsement but she knows she has to go out and earn it and what we see is very tactically how her campaign has been able to pivot in terms of doing a really a relatively ground campaign of contacting state governors contacting elected officials in congress contacting state party chairpersons in order to get their support get them on board with her so while shes doing that tactically you also see this pairing if you will of grassroots movements from the democratic base you saw the womans car that took place the black womens car that took place on monday the black men had a call on tuesday you saw members of the aapi community also to do a zoom call you saw the hispanic community do a zoom call and you also you saw white women do whats called yesterday too as well so if you look this coalition building of the democratic party you saw two front vice president harris operating the phone system and really connecting with the party aspect and then you saw the grassroots movement really showing their support you those two together and you see this historic movement to launch campaign in the way that weve never seen before and oh by the way elizabeth you saw the money began to pour in and so all this is creating this unprecedented campaign that weve never before that will be studied but i really do believe that this is going to a movement that the people are demanding as well so its really fascinating to see how that happened i do think one of the key questions there so just just a follow up on that mike you know we we see the momentum we see the support the public shows the support the dollars flowing but does that translate to votes right does get people still a hundred days out does that get people especially in those critical battleground states to show up and actually vote in a way that will come down to this election that we know is is going to be tight if its if the past election was it was any indication thats a really great question elizabeth i always like to look at the fundraising aspect in the sense of those grassroot low dollar donors the donors at donors i always at those individuals as the investors of a campaign those are the ones that are going to be sticky those no ones going to contact their friend their neighbor their church members community members that make sure they vote for their candidate but whats so interesting me what stood out was how much on these grassroots movement zoom calls elizabeth it all came down to organization and on the call there was all the call to action about how all those individual groups were going to activate on the ground throughout their community statewide so only do you have the traditional campaign volunteers those who are working for their campaign offices in these states but now you have this grassroot coalition who are promising and pledging to offer to be volunteers and to activate we havent seen that before now does that translate to a vote im not quite the sure but i say elizabeth as you know were going to get after the false start into the gotv efforts thats going to be really beneficial for the gotv efforts to have that type of grassroot campaign coupled with that coupled with the labor unions who also to assist with the gotv efforts and to translate that to vote so theyre in a good position i would say well and then kiran do you think the question a lot of say is okay we became united after a couple of tumultuous but does this momentum last are we sort of in a honeymoon phase that republicans are saying is the phase right now for harris or will this momentum continue well i think just to build mikes point you know one of the metrics i think is so impressive and speaks to your question is that of the donors in that first hours were first time donors this cycle so thats a huge metric then i think number two when you talk about this honeymoon the reality is yes this is going to be the biggest most exciting week of course but then a couple of days you know youre going to have the vp announcement and thats going to be equally exciting and sort of extending this honeymoon if you want to call it that andrew i have to look at whats happening on the other side concurrently which is that jd vance you know already didnt want to debate kamala harris now trumps afraid to debate kamala harris meanwhile hes being you know fending off these stories of i guess you know the word would be objective field guy and these weird you know creepy things coming out about vance so i think not only is a huge exciting moment for democrats it really does seem you know kamala is going viral for all the right reasons theyre going viral for all the wrong reasons and that matters you want be going viral for the right reasons in a campaign mike kiran and barbara were going talk more about the campaign coming up so stick around talk about business is always taking center stage inflation in the economy of course top for voters some americans are choosing their wallets over hearts in this years election thats coming up

the days top stories a lot of news today so lets get into it listen now to the daily news podcast honored with four edward r murrow awards and see why the new york times calls it a news podcast worth listening to you start here abc news make it your daily first listen now thats a part of the story that you didnt see coming wherever get your podcasts start here in our spotlight us stocks as you can hear there rally today closing out the week on a higher note then it started investors on wall street are reacting to new data that showed inflation cooled from may to june gives me a five hundreds up an impressive so far this year thats whats reflected in a lot of retirement accounts yet despite those gains along with historically low unemployment and strong economic growth there are still many americans weary about the state our economy and their own financial situations its a phenomenon analysts have dubbed the vibe session with the election right around the corner what does this five session mean for the presidential race lets bring question to our panel mike kayvon and barbara mike what do you make of this vibe session phenomenon that the vibes are there for a recession but theres really no recession in the data are people talking about this on your radio show what are the vibes youre hearing absolutely this is one of those mat situations where what on the ground are feeling mentally is not reflecting in all the economic indicators that you often talk always always see a great report about how strong the economy is doing i think it comes down to just a couple of simple factors of that the american public just isnt you know astute on economic and economic verbiage if you look at a report came out just this week that gdp rose in the second quarter most americans dont understand what a gdp or what it means the rise by two point they understand the unemployment is down but some people are still having trouble finding they have yet to see their reflection that their wages actually gone up over the last four months above the inflation rate but that has been reflected in the paychecks they see that mentality so they have been able to make that connection because elizabeth the tangible things that they see day is what they still see is expensive like rent for example still high mortgage rates are still high for individuals who are looking to be first time home owners and so it just those everyday first of the month dynamics have not gone down yet and so making it complicated which is why its hard to make that switch and coupled social media plays a big role in this its this echo chamber elizabeth of like well it seems fun and trendy to always say how bad the economy is and so it just reinforces a mentality that the economy must be bad although the indicators say opposite i know we get a lot more comments when i post stories about bad news on the economy than i do about good ones barbara you know when look what the polling says about this voters do generally rank republicans higher than democrats when it comes to the handling of the economy what do you thinks behind that does that translate into momentum for the gop not just the presidential race but down the ballot in november well you know it didnt turn out to really do that in two when when were supposed to be at republicans back and i think once again for the vice president shes going to have some pretty good timing because it looks like theres going to be a soft landing you may even have a it looks like theres going to be a rate cut in september coming out of the convention she could get some really good headwinds in the economy so and donald trump doesnt talk about the economy that much hes talking about hannibal lecter and hes talking about sharks and hes talking about its legal problems a lot of times so i think now when you have the vice president much better at articulating every day kitchen table issues then unfortunately joe biden was able to i think youre going to have a lot better opportunity come labor day for the democratic ticket to be able to take these issues to the public its a good point that whoever takes office in the economy will be by a lot of measures in really good shape setting up a good starting point at least kiva im curious what you think of this vibe session and why president biden maybe doesnt the credit when you look at this historically strong economy by a lot of measures well i think thats been one of the biggest challenges people always ask me is why cant democrats get this message through to the voters the economy because weve been hearing now for months that it is doing well and it is so strong and i think there are two opportunities with this sort of kamala reset because first of all for the first time and i mean i dont think any campaign could imagine this theyre carrying her speeches on every topic the wonky policy ones on every network you know thats thats amazing so she has the ability to command attention there and sort of have this concurrent thing where now because joe bidens out you do have the takes and the debrief and the oh lets look back at what really was one of the most historic presidencies of our modern times including with all of these economic wins so hopefully those two messages at the same time will pierce through and the voters understand the economys in good shape they like those wonky policy remarks here on abc news live take those whenever we can mike kiran and barbara thanks so much stick around coming up on our last call celine dion makes an

it is time for our last call the olympic games in paris are officially underway the opening ceremonies featuring the much anticipated return to the stage from celine dion thats after her diagnosis with stiff personal syndrome the legendary singer performing at the base of the eiffel tower in the rain the ceremonies also feature performances by lady gaga who was floating down the river other boats showcased athletes from various countries acrobatic performers dangled from scaffolding on the notredame cathedral even snoop dogg was seen earlier in the day carrying the olympic flame through a paris suburb lets bring back our panel mike kiran and barbara all right mike what do you make of this much anticipated return to the stage for celine dion here i mean its absolute incredible you want to talk about an olympic athlete having that type of vocal ability that she does her vocal gift is an athletic skill set in particular with the type rare disease that she has with just a stiff person disease the challenge with that is that people wouldnt normally have that disease it can create muscle spasms when theyre overstimulated by sight by sound by touch and was so nerve wracking is that thats all that olympic ceremony is is is excitement its light and so the idea that we were kind of our breath to see would she be able to get through that performance with that type of condition she has because of the conditions on the ground with all that noise the sound the touch the sensitivity and i think for her the excitement for her to be able to do that so for her to still be able to grace us with the privilege hearing that beautiful angelic voice is such a treat for this olympics and will go down as part of olympic history that were able to hear that performance one more time and what an epic way to make a return right to heaven what do you think are you a celine dion fan lady gaga what do you you know i am i just saw a spoof i guess of the titanic featuring her called titanic

negative energy from the casimir effect still a mystery,check out my new quiz app support me on donorbox,the most controversial physical phenomenon is probably the casimir effect that s an attractive force between two conducting plates even if the plates are uncharged yes uncharged just the plates it s a real thing and has been measured but just what it means has remained subject of debate the standard explanation for the casimir effect is that the vacuum between the plates is different from the vacuum outside the plates the vacuum outside has a higher pressure so that pushes the plates together sounds well and good but if you calculate the energy between the plates then that comes out to be negative which really shouldn t happen unfortunately it s a really tiny negative energy and the plates are much heavier than that but it brings up the question if the plates weren t much heavier than that negative energy would they fall up i ve had many arguments about that,0.0
is the news too negative,christian bryant explains why many say the news is too negative though research shows humans tend to be more attentive to,in this episode of in the loop were giving you a peek behind the curtain as part of national news literacy week we sit down with the ceo of the ew scripps company our parent company to talk about the role journalists play in gaining your trust every single day we we exist to serve the people of this country and i think we have to make sure that were always living u to that standard plus the oscar nominations have dropped and everything everywhe all at once is well all over the place we look at what other films are in the running and trends with this years academy award nominations this is in the loop im christian bryant well get to those stories in a few but first its national news literacy week and while that might not mean much to you its a pretty big deal here at scripts in honor of it we thought wed explore some common complaints about the media this week since we know yall got them take ownership for our faults we know were not perfect and figure out how we can do things better to kick things off lets start by law looking at why people avoid the news i guess if youre watching this youre not avoiding i tl specifically and we appreciate that but turns out a lot of folks choose to avoid the news in general a reuters oxford study found more than of americans sometimes avoi the news and the main reason is that its too negativ and quote brings down the mood i think that the media have always been accused of being excessively negative thats ed wasserman a professo at and former dean of the graduate school of journalism at uc berkeley he spoke with scripts news about the factors behind declining news consumption in america news is in part defined around things that depart from significance things that draw peoples attention things that people will find shocking or disturbing and feel that they need to know about lets face it the worlds a weird place yall and journalists are just trying to make sense of it all and i got to point out that we as humans also have whats known as negative news bias research shows that bad news prevails as many folks have heard before if it bleeds it leads right and humans have a tendency to be more attentive to negative content if more people are talking and interacting with bad news social media algorithms can exacerbate that bias by only bringing negative news to their feeds and what the social media engineers have found is that information that is kind of colorful thats outrageous that is infuriating that speaks to a particular mindset particularly polarized sliver of the audience that information keeping people online and following through and following along threads of information along the same ideological lines is very profitable the reuters oxford study we mentioned earlier found that the consumption habits of folks whove grown up with social media are very different than traditional cons methods like tv or newspapers research shows fac remains the most used social platform for news but users also complain they see too much news in their feeds compared to other platforms meanwhile on tiktok of young adults said they use it as a platform for news with americans having some of the higher numbers among countries survey where people consume their news can also depend on political affiliation as we cov a bit monday regardless of how or where americans are getting their news being quote worn out by the amount of it is one of the most cited reasons for news avoidance take the war in ukraine as an example while russias invasion initially increased news consumption as time wore on there was also an increase in selective avoidance of relevant content even in countries directly impacted by the conflict like poland and germany then theres also the feeling of there being too much of a certain kind of news like the constant coverage of politics or covid these are complex subjects and the media keeps revisiting them as developments arise but the public just doesnt seem that interested i think the problems the better the media get an understanding the full complexity of the problems that we face the harder job it is to present those in ways that make sense to to readers who are not experts in those fields theres also a portion of audiences that say they actively avoid news because they feel it leads to arguments or feel like they can do anything about it to some degree we need to be mindful of the fact the media are victims of or theyre at the mercy of the political the political scene theyre covering if that scene itself has degenerated into a food fight then the media has very little option but to cover that food fight so what can journalists do to improve the perception of news nina alvarez who is the director of global journalism a columbia journalism school say the media can improve on how we cover and explain some of these polarizin topics i think that we focused on one aspect of the border crisis and that is the negative impact that um politicians want us to talk about and i think that we have allowed that narrative to to be the only narrative not that theres much positive to that story but i think that there is something that would help the american viewer understand bett what is really behind this massive migration thats something alvarez mentioned is basically a shift away from reporting just the he said she said of an issue and go deeper explore the why and inquire about solutions not to toot our own horn but thats something in the loo tries to do with all of our deep dives every night taking a step beyo the headlines and digging into a topic media experts say its crucial news organizations evolve our approach to be more human and solutions focused no only does it create a common benefit but it also doe it also engenders a certain gratitude and and towar the media that are presenting this with those stor being a journalist isnt always easy but for many of us its the passion that drives us so well be here as watchdogs because for many of us we actually care about the stuff you dont care about the world if you dont care about others if you dont care about people dont be a journalist it happens we have journalists wh dont care about people but um but theyre not the best journalist to tell us more about journalism and why people avoid the news were joined by chris wells of boston university chris is an emerging media studies professor at bcu whose work focuses on understanding how people make sense of new media systems chris thank you so much for joining us on in the loop one of the things that i told you before we got started is that i dont get a chance to talk to people about this kind of stuff very often so i appreciate your presence here absolutely thanks for inviting me yeah without a doubt so weve been exploring this idea of negativity in news and experts weve talked to so far seem to suggest that a lot of that comes from whats actually happening in the world around us lets lets take politics for an example we see reporting on the vitriol thats happening within political circles and it just so happens weve seen a lot of that as of late is that too simple an explanation or could the media be doing more to report so called bad news differently reporting bad news differently they can also repo good news a lot of the conversation that im hearing from journalism and journalists is that theres also good things going on and theres almost a way in which the public can lose sight of those things and you can get problems with trust when people dont know how institutions that do work a lot of the time how they do work so for example if you take one of the sort of pseudo scandals that weve had in the last few years in terms of our electoral system weve had a big debate about the electoral system partly because donald trump pointed his finger at it as being a big problem but in fact a lot of the news thats come out about it has shown how remarkably well it works over and over again and our system is very decentralized this means thousands of people in our country are making elections work reall really well every two years or even more frequently so those kinds of stories about how things work when theyre going well those stories could also be told another issue id love to get your thoughts on is digital media and audience attention spans i feel like half the time when im online or what im looking for news im kind of like doug from the movie up the dog with a very short attention span its always like you know we have so much news on our fingertips these da but algorithms are dictating a lot of the news people see and also bombarding people with news causing many folks to just disengage what are your thoughts on that and how can we as journalists keep those audie engaged in what we do man that is a big thorny question right because theres so many things happening theres so many things happening at the same time because inconveniently ju as this has happened the economic model for journalism has turned upside down newspapers especially used to have these these rich revenue streams from print advertisements um that has has crashed really with the digital era and so we maybe see some degradation in the quality of a lot of journalism as news organizations find themselves f to appeal to audiences that are distracted by all these other media um and then as you mentioned the algorithms we also have to keep in mind that theres really smart people who are spending a lot of time and resources to capture our attent and kind of grab it and um you know were were all kind of subject to it because theyre using really psychological science as a journalism professor id like to tell my students to keep producing really high quality journalism um and that that that will get noticed and it will make its way um into the public sphere but theres also a bigger problem that we as a society have to think a little bit about which is that the public good that is created by news in terms of an informed public isnt well served by this economic model and we need to think about how were going to fund that public good just like we try to predict the the the air or the water having a public that knows whats going on and knows what the institutions aro them are doing is a public good that we have to find a way to protect even if the particular digital media environment brand isnt doing a great job of it over the past few years news outlets have been covering a lot of complex issues on the fly it seems covid is a pretty perfect example and the growing body of what we know or what we knew when we knew it um a lot of people have been turning awa from covid news for any number of reasons updates are too frequent its too scary its too tough to understand maybe even too divisive for some folks how do we get audiences back there and get them to care about something thats still posing a threat to our health and safety yeah i think youre right about those things theres definitel also an element of fatigue that theyve just been hearing about it for going on three years and and theyre tired of it but i think that recognizing that part of it is fatigue is worth is worth is worth it because it means that we can kind of recognize that some folks arent going to be reached necessarily i think go back to what i said earlier theres theres some room for telling positive stories about successe that weve had or ways that we have successfully mitigated um i think that can put a more positive spin on that kind of news as you mentioned another factor in what we call news avoidance is anxiety um so i think with covid maybe telling some more positive stories but also accepting that for some folks theyve theyve moved on and and also that even if theyre not consuming that news directly big issues in covid are are still likely to reach them maybe through other channels through social media or through just social networks chris wells is an emerging media studies professor at boston university and hes somebody wh gave us a lot to chew on chris thank you so much for your time and i appreciate you joining us here on in the loop thanks christian thanks for inviting me okay folks we hope this peek behind the curtain help clarify how the media functions but also challenge notions of whats driving the news and your role in the whole process and if youve got an appetite for more news analysis scripts news will continue to cover the issue of media literacy this week up next on itl were going deeper within our own company were chatting with e script ceo adam simpson about our mission here at scripps news

getting stuck in the negatives and how to get unstuck alison ledgerwood tedxucdavis,alison ledgerwood joined the department of psychology at uc davis in after completing her phd in social psychology at,transcriber tijana mihajlovićreviewer ellen maloney hi everyone gosh i wish i could dance but i cant and you really dont want me to so instead i thought i would talka little today about how people think im fascinated by this question im a social psychologist which basically meansim a professional people watcher so this is what i do i try to figure out how humans think and how we might be able to think better heres something i noticeda few years ago about how i seem to think heres a typical week in my life which usually seems to revolve entirelyaround publishing papers so here i am at maximum of my artistic abilitiesas a stick figure going along at baseline and a paper gets accepted i get this rush this blip of happiness and then im back to baselineby about lunch time laughter a few days latera paper might get rejected and that feels pretty awful and i wait for that blip to end but somehow i just cant stopthinking about it heres the craziest part even if another paper gets acceptedthe next day well thats nice but somehow i cant getthat pesky rejection out of my head so what is going on here why does a failure seemto stick in our minds so much longer than a success together with my colleague amber boydstunin the political science department i started thinking about this question this question of do our mindsget stuck in the negatives we all know intuitively that there are different waysof thinking about things the same glass the saying goescan be seen as halffull or halfempty theres a lot of researchin the social sciences showing that depending on how you describethe glass to people as halffull or halfempty it changes how they feel about it so if you describe the glass as halffullthis is called the gain frame because youre focusingon whats gained then people like it but if you describe the same glassas halfempty a loss frame then people dont like it but we wondered what happenswhen you try to switch from thinking about it one wayto thinking about it another way can people shift back and forth or do they get stuckin one way of thinking about it does one of these labels in other wordstend to stick more in the mind well to investigate this questionwe conducted a simple experiment we told participants in our experimentabout a new surgical procedure and we randomly assigned themto one of two conditions for participants in the firstcondition the first group we described the surgicalprocedure in terms of gains we said it had a success rate for participants in the second group we described the procedurein terms of losses we said it had a failure rate so its the exact same procedure were just focusing peoples attentionon the part of the glass thats full or the part of the glass thats empty perhaps unsurprisinglypeople like the procedure when its describedas having a success rate and they dont like it when its describedas having a failure rate but then we added a twist we told participants in the first group you know you could think of thisas a failure rate and now they dont like it anymoretheyve changed their minds we told participants in the second group you know you could think of thisas a success rate but unlike the first groupthey stuck with their initial opinion they seemed to be stuck in the initialloss frame that they saw at the beginning of the study we conducted another experiment this time we told participants about the current governorof an important state who is running for reelectionagainst his opponent we again had two groups of participants and we described the current governorstrack record to them in one of two ways we said that when the currentgovernor took office statewide budget cuts were expectedto affect of about jobs and then half of the participants read that under the currentgovernors leadership of these jobs had been saved they like the current governorthey think he is doing a great job the rest of the participants read that under the currentgovernors leadership of these jobs had been lost and they dont like the current governorthey think hes doing a terrible job but then once more we added a twist for participants in the first group we reframed the informationin terms of losses and now they didnt likethe current governor anymore for participants in the second group we reframed the informationin terms of gains but just like in the first studythis didnt seem to matter people in this groupstill didnt like the current governor so notice what this means once the loss framegets in there it sticks people cant go back to thinkingabout jobs saved once they thought about jobs lost so in both of these scenarios actually the current governor gets oustedin favor of his opponent at this point we were getting curiouswhy does this happen could it be that its actuallymentally harder for people to convert from losses to gains than it is for themto go from gains to losses so we conducted the third study to test how easily people could covertfrom one frame to another this time we told participants imagine theres beenan outbreak of an unusual disease and six hundred lives are at stake we asked participants in one group if a hundred lives are savedhow many will be lost and we asked participantsin the other group if a hundred lives are losthow many will be saved so everyone just has to calculate minus and come upwith the answer of but whereas people in one grouphave to convert from gains to losses in order to do that people in the second grouphave to convert from losses to gains we timed how long it took themto solve this simple math problem and what we found was that when people had to convertfrom gains to losses they could solvethe problem quite quickly it took them about seconds on average but when they had to convertfrom losses to gains well now it took them far longeralmost seconds so this suggests that once we thinkabout something as a loss that way of thinking about ittends to stick in our heads and to resist our attempts to change it what i take away from this researchand from related research is that our view of the worldhas a fundamental tendency to tilt toward the negative its pretty easy to go from good to badbut far harder to shift from bad to good we literally have to work harderto see the upside of things and this matters so think about the economy heres economic wellbeingfrom to you can see it tankedjust like we all remember and then by late it has recoveredby most objective measures but heres consumer confidenceover the same time period you can see it tanksright along with the economy but then it seems to get stuck instead of reboundingwith the economy itself consumers seem to be psychologically stuckback there in the recession so oddly then it may take more effortto change our minds about how the economy is doingthen to change the economy itself on the more personal levelwhat this research means to me is that you have to workto see the upside literally this takes workthis takes effort and you can practice thisyou can train your mind to do this better theres research out at uc davis showing that just writingfor a few minutes each day about things that youre grateful for can dramatically boostyour happiness and wellbeing and even your health we can also rehearse good newsand share it with others we tend to think rightthat misery loves company that venting will help get ridof our negative emotions that well feel better if we just talkabout how terrible our day was and so we talk and we talk and we talkabout the boss who s driving us crazy and that friend who never called us back and that meeting at work where every little thingthat could go wrong did but we forget to talkabout the good stuff and yet thats exactlywhere our minds need the most practice so my husband who hasthis disconcerting habit of listening to what i sayother people should do and then pointing out that technically speakingim a person too laughter has taken to listening to mefor about two minutes on days when i come home all grumpyand complaining about everything and he listens and he says okay but what happenedtoday that was good so i tell him about the studentwho came up to me after class with this really interestinginsightful question and i tell him about the friendwho emailed me out of the blue this morning just to say hello and somewhere in the tellingi start to smile and i start to think that maybemy day was pretty decent after all i think we can also workin our communities to focus on the upside we can be more awarethat bad tends to stick one mean comment can stickwith somebody all day all week even and bad tends to propagate itself right somebody snaps at you and you snap backand you snap at the next guy too but what if the next timesomebody snapped at you you forgave them what if the next time you hada really grumpy waitress you left her an extra large tip our minds may be builtto look for negative information and to hold on to it but we can also retrain our mindsif we put some effort into it and start to see that the glass may be a little more fullthan we initially thought thank you applause,0.0

the fed s negative lag effects are finally here economist signals,piper sandler chief global economist nancy lazar on the crypto picture interest rate trajectory and the global inflation outlook,back take a look at futs mixed market dow industrials flat up one point nasdaq now lower by sp lower by one point after pretty good rally yesterday stocks closed higher with dow up better than points at the close sp finished a new record high yesterday and nasdaq was led by chip stocks nvidia nvidia leading the charge to that plus gain for the nasdaq the stock was up better than yesterday after the semiconductor index down two days prior worse less than more than two months nvidia up again another fraction extending yesterdays gain piper sandler chief global economist i want to start on ai boom you said this ai boom is slowing down construction tell us more so we do expect capital spending ai related hardware strong increasing about companies starting to cut back on other couple expenditures the chip demand construction of factors at the same time a surge in the cost of buying equipment for those face cost of construction so now you are actually seeing companies counseled and or slowdown the development of some factory projects announced a couple years ago so real bifurcation within capital spending passed by us attorney unfortunately ai related capex only of capex not enough to alter overall picture from gdp perspective is we and a slight decline in capex commercial real estate continues under a lot of pressure construction or not office buildings we think construction a lot of factories again that was chip set to slow down in maria this is a really important point that you are making nancy because i watch big capex spending as indicator of broad globally story macrostory if you are being big purchases companies ceos at companies slowing down overall capex numbers does that impact the macro gdp story good point we saw fourth quarter announcing delay of being factories he is about a first and foremost interest rates up second things trending particularly in commercial real estate of the economy so we do think this is an capital of the lag effects of all that to fed and banks on so slowed but creeping into broader effect of economy leading to more general not outright recession into second and third quarter by the way i would have expected even bigger impact since federal reserve raised rates times i would have expected a bigger impact not just capex but whole host of growth areas for corporate america being are you surprised we havent seen aing bigger dent in economic growth as a result of rate hikes something i should have done last year i did this year on average how long does it take for fed rate cycle to negatively impact economy on average quarters not four not even eight quarters on average quarters we are right now in quarters moving into timeline in lag effects of time established should have negative impact so i think that we had a couple false starts third quarter expectations so view that will have we tend to agree with that we think moving into that period as we go into again second third quarter maria quarters very good info i like what you wrote in recent report about canceled project mentions quoteunquote in companies earnings call you say tend to correlate inversely capex planned canceled plans significant in fourth quarter absolutely goes back to cost can have capital the demand a surge in prices on constructing factories over almost past three years cost building a factory companies talking about what may be prices were now higher as a result squeezing budgets with costs in turn starting to cancel projects we have our data where we monitored capital spending plans we similar conclusions there also in our data has seen clear is companies into the united states or capital plans in maria you list them i love you list number of companies that actually mentioned it what do you think about the rest of the year and thefrz rate cuts we are hearing so much about nancy fed meeting next week march yield on year right now all the way back typical close to as federal reserve pick off that meeting european central bank policymakers likely cutting rates as victory against inflation in site according to ecb bank of japan give your take on central banks of the world what happens next a very very diverse world here in the united states we have clearly sticky inflation our point that is unless we do get a very clear slowdown in the economy recession in the economy increasing unemployment rate we think that was postponed fed rate cuts in if our outlook unfolds and higher unemployment rate indeed that does mean inflation will slow sustained basis i think a little early to come to that conclusion given what his perceived results in inform in the us economy europe it is unfortunate germany practically driver you european essay is a major headwind the european economy stagnant growth in are not very productive if anything wage costs way too high strong unions and so the margins that has postponed cb easing we do expect to see we expect to see ecb easing but because really really in a very bad place how much going to ease it maybe very diverse world indeed doj they have their you know their very definitely want strong wage gains help corporate revenues profits of soared increases odds you are getting bigger wage gains does obviously increases dodge can start to scale back japan our favorite still our favorite balanced economy because of profit cycle for now very very strong currency come back a little bit expectations dial back stimulus we dont think a negative for japan we just think increasesodes inflation doesnt get out of control again you cant make no way to synchronize global economies maria look japan has been the one to watch recently for sure a lot of money moving into japan nancy great to ta,0.0

watch biden speaks after testing negative for covid nbc news,watch live coverage as president joe biden delivers remarks from the rose garden after testing negative for covid,good morning we are coming on the air because president biden is about to make his first public inperson appearance since testing positive for covid last thursday hes going to speak from the rose garden just about an hour after tweeting this out a picture of a negative test saying he was going back to the oval his doctor kevin oconnor also releasing a statement this morning saying mr biden has tested negative twice since last night he is feverfree dr oconnor says the president will then discontinue the isolation hes been doing hes been isolating for five full days while we wait for president biden to walk out to the rose garden i want to get right to our chief white house correspondent kristen welker and kristen the president is expected to frame this moment as an illustration of how and why the administrations pandemic response has been working reporter thats absolutely right hallie president biden is going to use this as a teachable moment this is what we have seen from administration officials hes going to talk about the fact that hes vaccinated and twice boosted that he took the antiviral paxlovid and that is part of the reason why he had such a mild infection now we are expecting a bit of stagecraft at work here hallie hes been isolating for five straight days hes going to be emerging from the residence where he has been in isolation behind me white house officials who have not seen him hallie for those five days so here is the president walking out seeing these officials for the first time since he tested positive for covid hes going to declare the fact that he is now negative his staff are saying he will continue to wear a mask for about ten days because of course in rare instances there can be a recurrence of infection for those who take paxlovid and hes going to be testing more regularly hallie a lot of issues looming over this announcement but today hes going to be focused on covid hallie thank you lets listen to president biden as i was walking out i thought i heard a rumbling of my staff saying oh hes back thanks for sticking around hello everyone ive just tested negative for covid after isolating for five days cheers and applause thankfully ill now be able to return to work in person but i want to thank you all for your well wishes your prayers over this past week and the calls ive gotten i also want to thank the medical team here at the white house for the incredible care they gave me fortunately god thankfully god willing my symptoms were mild my recovery was quick and im feeling great the entire time i was in isolation i was able to work to carry out the duties of the office and without any interruption its a real statement on where we are in the fight against covid right now we are facing a new variant the ba variant a very transmissible version of omicron variant we saw here this past winter in fact this new variant that infected me is getting a lot of people infected all around the world not just here in the united states we should take precautions to try to slow the spread of this virus my administration made billions of dollars in funding available to improve ventilation in our schools and our public buildings we made tests widely available so you can take one before attending a large indoor gatherings or visiting with highrisk individuals we made highquality masks available for free so you should consider wearing a mask when youre in a crowded indoor public place these precautions add an extra layer of protection for you and for those around you but the reality is that ba means many of us are still going to get covid even if we take the precautions that doesnt mean were doing anything wrong unfortunately this covid is still with us as it has been for two and a half years but our fight against covid is making a huge difference whats different now is our ability to protect ourselves from serious illness due to covid in fact thats radically different today than it was just a year ago covid isnt gone but even with cases climbing in this country covid deaths are down nearly and when i took office thats difference between today and when i took office thats whats new thats whats new in covid response different from where we were just a year ago even if covid even if you get covid you can avoid winding up with a severe case you can now prevent most covid deaths and thats because three free tools the biden administration has invested in and distributed this past year booster shots athome tests easytouse effective treatments we got through covid with no fear i got through it with no fear a very mild discomfort because of these essential lifesaving tools and guess what i want to remind everybody they are free they are convenient and they are safe and they work first booster shots they werent available a year ago they are now everywhere every person age and over should get a booster shot if youre over years old you should get two booster shots i did and if you have your boosters up with if youre under two if youre over your odds of getting severely ill from covid are very very low even older americans are very unlikely to get severe covid if they have two booster shots most covid deaths are among those who are not up to date on their shots their covid vaccinations so if youre over and if you havent gotten a booster shot this year go get one right away go to covidgov type in your zip code and find a place where you can get a booster shot for free usually at a site thats less than five miles from your home second athome tests a year ago athome tests were rare and expensive now everyone in america can get them for free shipped to their door shipped to their door theres no excuse again go to covidgov and order athome tests for free testing to find out if your symptoms mean you have covid is critical in getting treatment quickly third treatments if you test positive you have a new powerful we have a new powerful treatment called paxlovid it wasnt available a year ago its now its a pill and now you can take these pills at home you can get them for free at tens of thousands of local drugstores around the country the food and drug administration the fda even put in a special rule so many pharmacists can prescribe these this particular drug so you dont even have to go to the doctor to get a prescription millions of americans have used paxlovid paxlovid excuse me i tell you what i think its i used it paxlovid including me this lifesaving drug reduces risk of hospitalization and death from covid by about again its free safe and easy to take and we moved quickly too make it widely available including the thousands of convenient tests to treat sites where you can get tested and if you need it paxlovid is at the ready right then and there when you make your visit again go to covidgov to find where test and treat sites near you heres the bottom line when my predecessor got covid he had to get helicoptered to walter reed medical center he was severely ill thankfully he recovered when i got covid i worked from upstairs of the white house in the offices upstairs and for that fiveday period the difference is vaccinations of course but also three new tools free to all and widely available you dont need to be president to get these tools to use for your defense in fact the same booster shots the same athome tests the same treatment that i got is available to you my administration has made sure that all americans across the country from all walks of life have free access to those tools covid was killing thousands of americans a day when i got here that isnt the case anymore you can live without fear by doing what i did get boosted get tested and get treatment at the same time my administration remains vigilant right now we have the tools to keep you from getting severely ill or dying from covid but were not stopping there earlier this week we had a conference at the white house for about the next generation of vaccines with the goal of keeping people from getting sick in the first place getting covid at all even getting it let me close with this over the past months my mirpgs have left no stone unturned in this fight against this pandemic none we brought down deaths by nearly since i took office because of the help of all the people in this rose garden businesses schools responded grandparents are hugging their grandkids again weddings birthdays celebrations are happening inperson again so lets keep emerging from one of the darkest moments in our history with hope and light for what can come get vaccinated if you havent gotten already and now get boosted order your free tests and if you get sick and test positive seek treatment take advantage of these lifesaving tools we have more of these tools than we ever had before and to my friends in congress lets keep investing in these tools vaccinations treatments tests and more so we can help make them available to americans the american people on a permanent basis lets get moving when i say a permanent basis as long as they are needed lets keep moving forward safely god bless you all and now i get to go back to the oval office thank you all very much cheers and applause president biden there delivering remarks from the rose garden with a noticeably lesshoarse voice than weve seen him so far saying he is feeling great and pointing out he says that you dont have to be president to get the kind of care that he got while he was isolating and recovering with mild symptoms he said covid is still with us but he says the fight that his administration is conducting is making a huge difference to progress against this pandemic he also drew a notable contrast with his predecessor former president donald trump who also got covid at a time when vaccines were not available i want to bring in now our chief white house correspondent kristen welker kristen in many ways this was a triumphant return at least in the eyes of the presidents staff to the west wing today it absolutely was hallie and you saw a number of his administration officials gathered behind me as the president was speaking there to applaud him both as he came out prosecute residence where hes been in isolation for five days and then again when he symbolically walked into the oval office a statement that he is now getting back to work and he did underscore and tout his administrations response to this pandemic that was of course core to his campaign he talked about the fact that we now have vaccines and booster shots and called out americans to get double boosted if they are in fact eligible he talked about the fact that paxlovid is now something that you can take at home which he did for five days and he talked about the fact that we now have more resources masks are more readily available and there has been more research poured into fighting this virus including athome tests hallie which this administration has distributed now it is also notable that at the very end he said hed recently had a meeting while he was in isolation about the next generation of vaccines and obviously theres been a lot of focus on that and whether they could prevent getting sick with covid altogether so if the focus is on that i heard exactly what you heard which is that sharp contrast he drew with his predecessor the fact that former president trump was taken to walter reed medical center he said i didnt have to go because we have all of these resources but it does come on the same week hallie where president biden took aim at his predecessor over something very different january th just a few days ago of course you and i have been reporting on extensively so that was a notable contrast that president biden raised and he now goes back to work kristen thank you in the couple of seconds we have left i want to bring in nbc medical contributor dr natalie azar dr azar is there anything you heard that you might recommend doing differently if president biden was your patient or is he taking the appropriate steps now recovering from covid and returning to the public stage yeah i mean hes certainly following cdc guidance here hallie he is allowed to be out of isolation he will be wearing a wellfitting mask anytime he is indoors with other people for a total duration of ten days as dr oconnor his doctor commented in his news brief today they are going to increase the cadence of his testing looking out very carefully in the next couple of days up to a week for any signs or symptoms and certainly antigen testing that would indicate any rebound and i want to finish by saying what really resonated to me is that he was couching covid as a vaccinepreventable illness and really i think did a good job outlining all of the steps the administration has taken to make boosters and testing and treatments available to the public so that his treatment was not just unique to him being the president of the us dr natalie azar thank you so much president biden again in the rose garden this morning for the first time now back in public since testing positive for covid that does it for our nbc news special report well have more tonight of course on nbc nightly news for all of us here at nbc im hallie jackson thank you so much for watching well see you soon,0.0
watch president biden drops out of presidential race endorses vp harris nbc news,watch live developments after president joe biden announced that he is dropping out of the presidential race president,tonight the presidents historic announcement president biden no longer running for a second term now the fallout and what happens next president bidens decision a political earthquake the race for the white house now thrown into disarray the president endorsing vice president kamala harris saying while he wanted to run again hes doing whats best for the party and the country the new focus on the vice president does she have the partys and voters support harris saying her intention is to earn and win the nomination but will other democrats challenge her the timeline fast approaching what it means for the democratic convention getting on the ballot in all states and what happens to all that money raised for biden former president trump weighing in what he told our correspondent about the new state of the race but are they ready to take on whoever democrats choose all of this one week after an assassination attempt on the campaign trail the presidents reg lease half a century in public life biden impact on the country his achievements while in office amid his strug jools and finally history playing out in realtime a political shakeup the nation hasnt experienced in nearly years announcer this is nbc nightly news with lester holt good evening and welcome tonight we are witnessing a major upheaval in american politics and the race for president just over days before americans go to the polls in november president biden has announced he will not seek reelection writing a new chapter to his legacy today in a letter to the nation the president saying it is in the best interests of my party and the country for me to stand down on his reelection bid mr biden has faced a steady erosion of support for his candidacy among democrats in the weeks following his concerning debate performance last month on the heels of his announcement the president tonight endorsing vice president kamala harris to succeed him on the top of the ikt ticket in a statement the president announcing her intention to earn and win this nomination but the path forward for democrats and how they will field a ticket is highly uncertain tonight we will explore it all in our expanded coverage beginning with kelly odonnell at the white house a sharp turn for history as president biden announced at pm there will be no last campaign for him i believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term then in a separate statement the president embraced his vice president i want to offer my full support and endorsement for kamala to be the nominee of our party this year a move that attempts to blunt any effort to open the nomination process before the august convention the president had raised harris in a press conference that was intended in part to settle doubts about his candidacy look i wouldnt have picked vice president trump to be vice president if i think shes not qualified to be president so lets start there reporter the vice president offered thanks to the bidens and made her intentions clear i will do everything in my power to unite the democratic party and unite our nation to defeat donald trump reaction tonight from former president barack obama who called joe biden a patriot of the highest order describing the decision as a testament to joe bidens love of country praise from bill and hillary clinton for his extraordinary career of service while highlighting their worry about the threat posed by a second trump term after a half century of public life his political brand was forged by being underestimated i know like millions of americans know when you get knocked down you get back up reporter the president had tried to save his shot at a second term i would not be running again if i didnt believe with all my heart and soul i can do this job reporter but that did not quiet the pressure after that june debate performance look we finally beat medicare reporter an extraordinary rupture followed a course of rejection that grew louder for weeks i think a new generation its time for a new generation to try to heal the party and heal the country the president is not capable of delivering the message in an effective way i dont think he should stay in the race kelly what comes next for the president president says he will address the nation time this week and aides say that is depending on his recovery from covid he remains at his delaware beach house the vice president has been at her official residence in washington and aides say she and the president have spoken multiple times today kelly odonnell starting us off kristen welker moderator of meet the press joins me now friday the president said once hes over covid he would be back on the campaign trail what changed the calculus kristen lester this moment has been building since the debate and reached a fever pitch when democratic leaders from nancy pelosi to hakeem jeffries chuck schumer privately told president biden they didnt think he could beat donald trump and that he could jeopardize democrats chances at holding on to the senate and taking back the house but it went joined democratic leadership people who support joe biden were protesting outside of the white house calling on him to pass the torch ultimately the pressure became too great as he throws his backing to the vice president how competitive is she what data do we have reporter vice president harris matches up against former president trump vim lateral to joe biden in our most recent nbc news poll trump leads vice president harris to once she reintroduces herself to the american public they expect her poll numbers to go up kristen welker thank you were hearing from vice president harris tonight thanking joe biden for his endorsement but the question remains will she get the full backing of democrats here is hallie jackson does give kamala harris the funding and the operation that was put together for the two of them so she is the heir to that in terms of the structure of the money and the operation that is formidable against anyone else in the party who might seek to get the nomination so we are at a point this is clearly historical there is a human aspect where this has been painful for the president and disappointing for him and now its a pageturning moment where the party has a chance to again focus on donald trump and also try to make certain it has a ticket going forward thats ready for the convention and ready for the next several months fighting to november lester kelly let me bring in our meet the press moderator kristen welker and senior washington correspondent hallie jackson is it important that the president appears to be all in on this thing there are going to be opportunities to perhaps campaign for his successor how is that all going to look lesser its critical that president biden made the decision to endorse his vice president kamala harris because he is sending a signal to the party lets move forward with vice president harris for all of the reasons that kelly just mapped out she inherits the war chest that he has been building up and that is not insignificant and look we know that the cbc has said that it supports kamala harris as well as a number of democrats so this is a significant moment and again lester its about sending a signal to the party that it is time to move forward and also sending a signal that instead of having a mini primary which some folks are calling for hes clearly urging the party to get behind kamala harris so that they can start the hard work of trying to take on former president donald trump think about what we all witnessed last week in milwaukee the republican national convention this party united around former president trump that really added urgency i think to this situation to the calculation that democrats have remember the polling lester a majority of americans saying they dont want to see this matchup between trump and biden and so part of the calculus here in addition to everything that kelly mapped out is this opportunity to inject a new face yes she is the vice president but ive been talking to sources who say she will reintroduce herself shes clearly found her voice on a number of different areas including reproductive rights one top democrat telling me quote theyre breathing a sigh of relief because now there is someone who can prosecute the case against former president donald trump now the question is who will she seek to become her running mate if she gets the nomination lester again as she said shes still got to fight and win the nomination so there are still a few more steps that have to take place i want to bring hallie into the conversation on that point hallie its washington you know how washington works its hard to imagine that there arent those on the sidelines right now who are looking to see if there is an opening here so those who were saying that the vice president the current vice president harris has a lock for this is it going to take a few days to see how it all settles out almost certainly but would be surprised if it takes longer than that all along even with this public pressure increasing for president biden to do what he did and withdraw from the ticket there has been a desire from democrats to basically get unified and get unified quickly because they understand that the election is creeping closer and closer every single day and it behooves them politically to be united as a party here the question becomes who ends up on the democratic ticket now vice president harris is in the pole position if she takes the top of the ticket the question is who would her running mate be there are a number of people speculation at this moment who could end up in that position youre seeing the names and pictures of some here including some who could challenge her for the top of the ticket if they chose to youre looking at michigans gretchen whitmer pennsylvanias josh shapiro californias glavine newsom he spoke with chuck and said it would be vice president harris ticket to lose if it were to come to that roy cooper from north carolina andy beshear from kentucky jb pritzker from illinois and senator mark kelly from arizona a couple things to talk about on this list here vice president kamala harris this is all assuming she ends up at the top and becomes the presumptive and official nominee for the democratic party she is already from the west coast shes already from california shes already got the support of a number of progressives we have seen that today already with for example the chair of the progressive caucus coming out and throwing her support behind kamala harris the question is what is this ticket going to do to reach out to people in for example the middle of the country in these key rust belt swing states in some of these critical places suburban women swing voters the small slice of independents who democrats hope will turn out and help them win the white house now for a second term that is why i think youre seeing some of the names for example the governor from pennsylvania obviously one of those critical states youre seeing somebody like roy cooper north carolina is a place that has swung purple its been red its been blue its been back so thats another question mark there for somebody like governor cooper youre seeing andy beshear from kentucky think about who donald trump picked as his running mate jd vance somebody that the trump campaign believes can speak to people in the rust belt states there is thinking that perhaps governor beshear could be that voice but on the democratic side of the ticket all of this lester lets be clear s preliminary you already have two of these people senator kelly and governor shapiro that have backed kamala have endo her as the presidential nominee i happen to suspect you might have some democrats who wait for president biden to come out and make her remarks publicly but obviously this is a major major moment in this campaign it just upends it all together at this moment we do have some polling showing that kamala harris maybe she does just as well or slightly better than president biden than former president trump we dont have a lot of clarity this has all been hypothetical up until seven hours ago i was going to mention the polling is only valuable to the extent that people see her as a vice president seeing her in a position of a presidential candidate has to be different the conversation will of course come up about the first black woman potentially president so what we know from the past will it be relevant as we watch marching forward here people showing their support to her yeah it will certainly be relevant but there is also to kristens point people who may give kamala harris another look a second look she is somebody who has been on the national stage for quite a while now she ran for president herself unsuccessfully before she was named joe bidens running mate prior that a prosecutor in california rose to become the attorney general in that state she is not an unknown entity here and not a household name in the course of her presidential campaign there have been concerns raised by democrats who saw the way her campaign was run there is going to be a desire she inherits the war chest inherits the operation from the bidenharris campaign what was formerly that campaign so she is in a position where she has some solid footing moved forward the question certainly becomes her next public appearance her next few what does that look like what does it look like in and when she ends up on a debate stage with former president trump will there be a vice presidential debate considering there is not even a vice presidential nominee on the democratic side still a lot of questions to be answered kristen whats the view do you think from team trump right now in terms of whether they really want to go up against her or they would have preferred for bide ton stay oh i think that the trump campaign was prepared to take on president biden and so as hallie says this upends everything having said that we know that the trump campaign has already started doing its opposition research against vice president harris as well as quite frankly all of those governors who hallie was just talking about because they are also potential candidates to be the democratic nominee if they so choose so i think that they are getting this in gear and have been for quite some time lester but there is no doubt particularly in the wake of that debate performance by president biden that they thought they had the upper hand in this race the polling bore that out both nationally and in the battleground states and so the trump campaign is really going to have to pivot here theres no doubt about that were going to see a strategy shift lesser kristen thank you were hearing from vice president harris tonight thanking joe biden for his endorsement but so many questions remain will she get the full backing of top democrats as weve been discussing and how will voters respond to her here is yamiche alcindor with whats ahead in this historic time reporter all eyes now turning to vice president kamala harris who has made history over and over again throughout her life her biggest history making moment was when she was elected vice president in becoming the first woman and first black and first south asian person to hold that role we believe that our country all of us will stand together for a better future reporter before that she had forged a path shattering glass ceilings in she served as district attorney of san francisco becoming the first black woman and south asian american woman in california to hold that office then seven years later she made history again in the same way when she was elected attorney general of california the role made her a rising star in the democratic party in november harris became only the second african american woman ever to serve in the senate and the first indianamerican ever mr president i rise to celebrate the anniversary of one of the most significant legislative achievements in american history the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act reporter she was raised in california the daughter of a jamaican father and indian mother who met as activists she later attended howard university a historically black college in washington dc she went on to law school at the university of california then she became a prosecutor a role she says helped her enact criminal justice reform from within the systems she often worked on cases dealing with sexual violence in she ran for president hoping to become the first black woman ever to be president now she will try to forge that path again and yamiche joins me now how are vice president harris and her allies preparing for a potential campaign against trump well vice president kamala harris spent today calling around to democratic leaders telling them she believes she has the confidence to beat donald trump shes been telling them shes going to earn this nomination and shes going to talk to all the different delegates to make sure she can officially win the nomination at the convention i spoke to one of the people who got a call from kamala harris today he was the congressional black caucus chair map he told me he got emotional during that call because of course the history shes going to make if she were to become not only the top of the ticket but the first black woman to be elected he told me he told her she was going to be a race she was not going to take any constituency for granted i was told in the last few weeks her allies were focusing on the fact she was going to have to build a campaign operation even though shes getting that war chest from the bidenharris campaign there is this idea shes going to have to build a different kind of campaign tailored specifically to her and shes going to have to be about her path to victory im told they are looking at states like north carolina and georgia thinking about southern african american voters and really mobilizing them the most but there is a long long todo list here of course first picking her vice president but also shoring up donations because at a time like this in the last few weeks donations have plummeted to democrats i mean to the biden campaign to there are a lot of people who are saying there are a lot of donors who are energized really ready to get behind her im also told shes going to be traveling just this week she will be going to milwaukee as well as indianapolis shes going to be continuing to go on the road she makes this case to voters but she has to make up for lost time here people close to her say shes going to be doing that thinking about the staff to hire and also going to be thinking about her messaging specifically because it looks like shes polling best among young people and her voice has resonated with women because she took the lead on abortion access and the messaging for the campaign there i want to bring in democratic senator from minnesota amy klobuchar who has just endorsed vice president harris thank you for joining us thank you you have endorsed her but you notably did not call for president biden to drop out can you explain that i think that people play different roles over this last month but for me this is not about looking in the rearview mirror people expressed our concerns in different ways but ultimately this was a presidents decision and he took the honorable path lester he took the path which is consistent with his career of conviction of integrity and i know its not just about his legacy getting us through the pandemic with vice president harris at his side working so hard to bring nato together moving forward on taking on the pharmaceutical companies its also about the future and his endorsement of kamala harris shows that he is laser focused on the next six months yes but also on the years to come do you think we will continue weve seen a ground swell of people and democrats endorsing vice president harris do you think that will continue that this will be a nonissue she will be the person in short order well sure were a big tent party and thats why we win we bring people with us so perhaps someone else would run i dont know but what i know is shes gathering yes it was mentioned progressive endorsements but mark warner who is a moderate democrat he endorsed her mark kelly which you noted on your show he endorsed her i think you see a coming together for a candidate who is a strong person i know i ran against her for president i saw how strong and fierce she is on that debate stage but more than that she brings the receipts shes been a leader on the world stage and she also again has worked on all of these policies and efforts that have brought us to fuller employment in a much better place than where we were coming out of the trump administration finally i cannot wait to see this scene where shes taking on donald trump who said that he was proud to have overturned roe v wade he just said that in a video and then shes the one that had crossexamined the very justices that made that decision to overturn roe v wade she will be able to make that case stronger than practically anyone i just spent part of last week in milwaukee at the republican national convention covering the activities there it was a strong show of unity what will the democratic convention look like coming out of this crisis if you will we always like to make news for you lester come on so the first thing youre going to see is kind of a speed dating situation for the vice presidential candidate because theres just not the time that we have had in the past however kamala harris knows these leaders some of the leading candidates and i know shes going to pick someone that she can trust thats a great leader and can govern and then someone who is actually will augment her skills we will stay tuned for that then you are going to have a convention that i predict will be unified there will have to be a process to get through this if stlr others running because as i said we are a big tent party but i promise a positive unified and yes ex siepgt next few weeks could this be a moment that falls in the category be careful what you wish for for all those people who did call for the president to step aside is there still some difficult days ahead here things that stand out to you potentially you know i just think there is people are focused on the bitterness and what this person did and what they wrote and what they called we dont have time for that im sure there will be books written im sure there will be movies made about this last month but the point is that we have to go together unified and put all that behind us there is simply not time to dwell on the past all right senator good to see you thanks so much for taking time it was great to be on thank you all right today president bidens challenger donald trump reacted to the news calling biden the worst president in history its a pivotal week for donald trump leading into the leading in the polls after surviving the assassination attempt last week and securing his partys nomination at the republican national convention but todays announcement throws the campaign into a level of chaos vaughn hillyard reports on that reporter for months the campaign of former president donald trump has prepared for a rematch with joe biden but now its focus point will shift in a social media post today trump writing we are forced to spend time and money on fighting crooked joe biden he polls badly after having a terrible debate and quits the race now we have to start all over again a move he was already preparing for at his campaign rally last night in michigan so who would you like to most run against if you are us if we want to win ready kamala harris crowd boos reporter taken before biden left the race recent national polling has showed harris current positioning not that different from biden in a hypothetical head to head matchup against trump but the republican nominee already taking shots this weekend at the current vice president who could become his direct opponent i call her laughing kamala did you ever watch her laugh shes crazy you knew you can tell a lot by a laugh no shes crazy shes nuts reporter trump meanwhile will hold a campaign rally on wednesday in battleground north carolina where a possible democratic running mate hails from current democratic governor roy cooper rnc chairman michael whatley said on saturday quote they have more than a messenger problem they have a message problem because kamala harris gavin newsom gretchen whitmer no matter who else is on this ticket is going to adopt those same platforms and those same policies and they are out of step with the american people the trump campaign currently has its eyes on seven key states though the dynamics could change with the new democratic nominee and the former president could still face a sentencing in midseptember after being found guilty by a jury in lower manhattan his legal team is preparing briefings for a judge challenging the verdict and vaughn hillyard has been covering the trump campaign he joins me now i know its really early but what do we know about the potential for a debate between mr trump and the vice president the reality was that there were two already scheduled presidential debates on the books between donald trump and the biden campaign and the second debate of course was going to be taking place this september on abc but donald trump on a social media post just a few minutes ago suddenly opening up the door and questioning whether he wants to stick to that game plan of course with joe biden no longer on the ticket and the question mark being whose presidential campaign is it actually going to be there are some open question marks he though in that social media post indicated that he would like fox news to be the one that hosts the debate we have reached out to multiple senior campaign advisers for clarification on the way that he has exactly viewing this politically and whether it would be advantageous to go on the debate stage or not its not clear at this time i was with the former president in republican nominees campaign yesterday in grand rapids michigan for that rally and was talking to a senior campaign official who told me they were preparing for all potential circumstances while for months now ever since donald trump first announced this third presidential bid they have had their eyes on a joe biden rematch and with just three months left they knew there could potentially be a jolt in this race on the democratic side and a change that they had been looking at internal polling and of course had been studying not only kamala harris but also other candidates who could potentially lead the top of the ticket of course it was an open question mark then who would be that vice presidential running mate to that democratic nominee who would be taking on jd vance because he already has campaign events planned this week in ohio and virginia vaughan thank you when we come back with our special coverage we will hear directly from the trump campaign as the former president prepares to face off against a new democratic nominee welcome back to our nbc news special report on president bidens historic decision to withdraw from the campaign the republican presidential nominee former president trump talking to his social media platform truth social or taking to that platform to criticize president biden calling him the worst president in the history of our nation let me bring in trump campaign senior advisor jason miller thanks for taking the time lester good evening i want to ask you actually pick up a conversation we were having before the break about a debate there is a debate that was on the books for september will it be transferable as it were well theres definitely going to be another debate or i guess in this case a first debate against whoever the democrats end up choosing but im not sure that the democrats are completely locked in on kamala harris yet we see where former president obama is still yet to endorse her seems to be a lot of confusion and chaos on the democratic side which is a big contrast to where the republicans are as you noted earlier with the united front in milwaukee this week but one thing lester stands out to me less than one month ago literally three and a half weeks ago democrats were decrying the use of these socalled cheap fake videos of joe biden shuffling along and within a month donald trump has knocked joe biden out of the presidential race with all of this chaos today and this shift over to kamala harris democrats cannot name one single state where theyre now in better position to win with kamala harris than they were with joe biden well i know theres been a lot of polling thats been referenced but im wondering how relevant that polling is its a new race if the vice president gets into it people will see it through different eyes of course there is the issue of the double haters weve watched develop over the last several months does that take that off the table and give voters a chance someone other than in this case president trump a really good question because these are things weve prepared for weve polled weve done the research we have the ads cut were completely ready to go this campaign is ready for anything that the democrats throw at us and the thing that really stands out from the harrisbiden administration is that kamala harris owns all of the failures of the past three and a half years whether it be the record setting illegal immigration she was the border czar for example the sky high inflation thats really crushing families all around our entire country but when you look at the core issue of competence that is the one thing that voters raise as a concern about kamala harris they do not think that she is ready to step into that leadership position that was interesting you just said you guys have prepared for this i mean how prepared are you theres things that move very quickly how prepared are you to run a campaign that now pivots toward vice president harris yeah another great question because were ready for again whether its kamala harris or anyone else they go and try to put in because where this race changes is as i said harris owns all of the failures of the last three and a half years theres also a new front thats going to be opened up here to give you a little bit of insight kamala harris had a long liberal record radical record in california well before she even became vice president you look at her efforts to dee criminalize illegal immigration her calls to abolish ice she wants to get rid of plastic straws for goodness sake whereas joe biden was renting some of the territory on the extreme left kamala harris owns t lester where the bottom falls out for democrats where they have real trouble is in pennsylvania michigan wisconsin working class voters union workers see cha as a threat to their very existence particularly in the auto industry she has also carried the administrations message about reproductive rights something we didnt hear much had in the republican convention does that campaigning the campaign up it will be up for the democrats for what they care about but kamala harris will be put on the spot for her radical and ex treenl positions in the debate joe biden couldnt answer what he thought a reasonable restriction would be for late term abortions there are a whole host of issues where kamala harris now has to answer aunt of those that i think she has to answer is if joe biden is not competent enough to run for reelection as president how can we say that hes competent enough to stay in the white house lester you masterfully ran the commander in chief series election after election and you sat down with joe biden just a week ago you know that putin xi the iranians all of our adversaries around the world are looking at the us right now licking their chops saying that we have joe biden in the white house and thats a dangerous thing i want to know does kamala harris think that joe biden is still component enough to be president jason miller thank you for coming on capitol hill correspondent ali vitali is from me weve heard from west virginia senator joe manchin is considering a white house run lester this would be the first potential challenge for vice president harris who has the backing of many in her party in these intervening hours since her boss president biden said he was no longer running for reelection manchin is at this point considering a bid but he also would have to change his party registration back in may he changed from being a registered democrat to a registered independent in order to mount this bid he would have to change his party affiliation back but of course he spent several weeks and months on a listening tour of the united states ultimately he did not end up running for president then many of his advisers say that that could be the same decision he falls to now but of course its too early to tell and we are just weeks from the democratic convention as we noted a moment ago how are democrats on the hill rallying support for her race or another candidate ahead of that harris is really the only name we have heard at this point lester thats with good reason especially as you go into this convention and yes technically the democratic convention is at the end of august but what the dnc is planning on doing as early as the first week of august so two weeks from now theyre doing a virtual nominating convention where they will nominate their nominee virtually at that point harris has to earn the majority of delegates if she doesnt then it shifts to a very chaotic potentially very messy open convention thats where someone like if manchin decides to put his hat in the ring he will have to do some work behind the sequence to get delegates on board for him all of that could lend to a perfectly chaotic process for democrats one that senator klobuchar was talking to you about in the last few minutes trying to put a happier spin on t but this would be a chaotic moment for democrats after a tumultuous series of weeks here in washington thats why right now were seeing so much effort behind vice president harris not just from elected democrats but also from the bidenharris campaign itself trying to give her the most advantage she can get chaotic i think thats a word we may be hearing a lot of in the weeks to come i want to bring in congressman lloyd doggett the first sitting member of congress to call on the president to step aside thank you lester you have not unlike many of your colleagues have not endorsed vice president harris do you intend to or someone else well lester from the very moment almost three weeks ago that i called on president biden to step aside i called for a fair open democratic process to select a replacement now i think vice president harris would be an excellent nominee she is the probable nominee she has all the advantages but i want this process to be open it doesnt have to be decided within a matter of minutes or hours of president bidens decision we need to engage the entire country in this that will make our nominee stronger if we have an open process some may call this chaotic i call it democratic with a small d and i think thats what people want i was curious if its the same as craziness im sorry crazy is not the word im looking for but messiness im sorry messy does open mean i will get this question out eventually does open mean messy it does and it means contentious but as long as its respectful disagreement so much the better as i said i think vice president harris is the probable candidate the likely one and many of my colleagues and groups have been stampeding this afternoon to join her i think that a number of the people that might have contested the nomination have already endorsed her so i think its headed that way but lets keep the process open enough that anyone who thinks they can make a strong case that they are the best candidate to prevent donald trump and his gang from taking over our government and maybe never giving it back that they have a chance also if you have that process and vice president harris is selected she will be all the stronger for it the virtual process i must say i dont believe is a good way to do this we need this to be open not through some virtual advance process as the dnc had originally proposed so what does that look like when we get to the convention then it looks like some of the conventions of old where uds multiple candidates competing or in vice president harris case it could well be her strong efforts eliminate most of the competition prior to that time but it is a process where america sees that were different than the republicans that were offering a candidate for a new generation that donald trump will be the old guy in this that if its vice president harris shes a prosecutor who prosecutors crime donald trump committed crime do you have a desire do you plan to reach out to president biden anything you would want to share with him i would say that i greatly admire his courage did he what donald trump could never do and that is to put country over his ego his legacy will be he did everything he could including sacrificing his future in order to save our country for someone who wants to move us in a authoritarian direction i admire him and appreciate his accomplishments and the sacrifice that he has made do you think about the fact that you were wrong if this does not help defeat donald trump what that means to you the party going forward well certainly thats always a consideration but i looked at the numbers hoping that after a year on your newscast and others that we saw the president behind in this and then in this debate that instead of a surge we got a setback that the numbers in one battleground state after another showed us going the wrong way based on those numbers i think we have a stronger nominee without president biden on the ballot and im glad he finally reached the same conclusion lloyd doggett congressman thank you for being with us president bidens announcement will have a massive impact on the election but it also will mark this term as the final political chapter in a storied career reporter voters have been talking about joe bidens age for decades at first questioning if he was too young so help you god i do congratulations senator thank you reporter at just years old joe biden was sworn in as a senator from delaware one of the youngest in us history he did it at the hospital bedside of his two sons who had sur viechd the car crash that killed his wife and monthold daughter amy just weeks after the election i make this one promise that if in six plonts or so there is a conflict between my being a good father and being a good senator i will contact governor elect as i had earlier and tell him that we can always get another senator but they cant get another father reporter at times he wanted to quit but fellow senators urged him to stay the course i want to thank you all really it means a lot to me i appreciate it and i hope that i can be a good senator for you all reporter representing the state of delaware for years he first set his sights on the presidency when he was in his s making an unsuccessful bid for the oval office in im angry with myself reporter followed by another attempt in before joining senator barack obamas ticket and ascending to the vice presidency i leave here today to begin my service to our nations first african american president reporter tragedy rocked the biden family again in when brain cancer took the life of a then vice presidents oldest son beau a year later speculation around whether or not the then vp would enter the presidential race once again ultimately stepping aside as hillary clinton became the democratic nominee historic unprecedented moment reporter in joe biden fueled by then president trumps comments about the racist rally in charlottesville decided to run for president once again during the democratic primaries he hinted at being a oneterm president look i view myself as a bridge not as anything else reporter for biden the third time was the charm at years old the man who came to washington as one of the youngest senators became its oldest president at this hour my friends democracy has prevailed reporter but his age put a magnifying glass on every stumble through the years in april biden announced he was running for a second term behind the scenes many democrats were concerned about his age and his poll numbers one of them congressman deen phillips even mounted an unsuccessful primary challenge the american public agreed polls early this year found fewer and fewer democrats confident in his mental capacity to serve as commander in chief the biden campaign hoping to change the narrative looked to the example of ronald reagan who erased concerns about his age in a debate with one iconic line i will not make age an issue of this campaign i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience reporter the biden camp agreeing to a june debate the earliest in modern history but for the president the night was a disaster displaying a raspy voice and at times struggling to come up with coherent answers look if we finally beat medicare reporter the presidents performance setting off alarms on the democratic establishment even his vp admitting it wasnt his best night it was a slow start but a strong finish reporter in the days after biden attempted to right the ship hosting nato leaders in washington and sitting for major network interviews it was a bad episode did you ever watch the debate afterwards i dont think i did no reporter but it wasnt enough as dozens of house and senate democrats began calling for him to drop out the growing drum beat finally too loud to ignore its up to the president to decide if he is going to run were all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short reporter the presidents more than half a century run in washington dc now coming to a close but not the way he wanted to give us more context on this unprecedented moment in american politics i want to bring in presidential historian douglas brinkley and nbc news presidential historian michael bescloss whats history tell us about this moment and where it may end up tells us not many presidents like to give up power george washington established a tradition in the job wasnt term limited in those days he could have served as president for the rest of his life and would have been elected he was trying to establish a precedent by leaving the presidency the president should give out a power when it is the right time to do so two recent examples quickly truman end of march he said he would not run again for the presidency after losing the new hampshire primary lyndon johnson after almost losing the new hampshire primary said he wouldnt seek the nomination of his party for another term but i now now i talked to his wife lady bird who told me what he really had in mind was that he would make peace in vietnam and the democratic convention would draft him for another term whatever he would answer yes or no obviously that never happened doug let me turn to you what do you think is the closest comparable moment to what were going through now and how it may inform us how this plays out you know michael did all the tape of lyndon johnson great books and to remind us what everybody is saying march of to a degree lyndon johnson did a minute talk and told the nation shocked people like some are shocked today that im not running for reelection the nomination was his for the taking but he had other reasons he said im focusing on vietnam i havent heard president biden say i have to focus on gaza and israel or ukraine he might when he gives his speech but you know lyndon johnson looks good in history for stepping down and he was great in the public opinion approval for a couple weeks but then the horrible events unspooled the assassination of martin luther king jr and bobby kennedy who had challenged him and in chicago at the convention things went haywire with mayor daley inaudible being arrested for protesting everybody this year has been feeling kind of eerie about like lyndon johnson joe biden will be remembered for his great domestic legislation his extraordinary accomplishments done in a difficult time he did it in a bipartisan way and was due to his great knowledge of how the senate and capitol hill works how it got done lyndon johnson has an extraordinary record of civil rights voting rights thats whats bringing my bell lbj michael we know that vice president harris right now is getting notable endorsements from democrats this is still a fractured democratic party for sure how have presidents in the past been able to unite their parties when theyve been in disarray well if it was an outgoing president like truman or johnson in both cases interestingly enough they did not make an endorsement so the fact that joe biden has said i want my successor to be kamala harris not only is that something that we have not seen in those cases of history but it also suggests that he must be pretty strong feel pretty strongly that she would make a very good president and but its a complicated relationship is it not it always is and vice presidents usually wind up looking a lot different when they are candidates and presidents from the way they did as vice president george hw bush is seen as a quite commanding president especially in foreign policy but during his eight years as the understudy of ronald reagan jimmy carter said the problem with bush is that he looks sort of goofy in moments like these crises like this what are the keys for leaders to cut through the noise and communicate effectively it is basically a matter of saying now he this is the way i see this moment all right michael bescloss mr brinkley thank you for joining us this will be in the hands of voters and antonia hilton has reaction from across the country what are you hearing reporter well voters have been shocked and emotions have been all over the place tonight lester ranging from relief in some cases gratitude to the president and some fear all the uncertainty take a look tonight voters nationwide react to go that historic announcement about president biden ending his reelection bid shocking surprising but at the same time like i think theres been a lot of talk about you know worry about his age and if hes competent and able to run reporter some voters stunned others saw it coming there was no way he was going to after his debate against trump i mean it was it was pretty sad reporter and some say the president should have dropped out sooner if it was going to happen it should have happened a lot earlier because like it will be very hard for like democrats to win if like with the current situation because its so close to the election reporter with president biden and a growing number of congressional democrats now rallying behind vice president kamala harris to become the new democratic nominee some voters happy about the change i do think im more excited to vote for kamala harris than joe biden i think she had a really great voice representing minorities shes been a strong advocate for womens rights r reproductive rights justiceoctiv ipoeder wn she samed ve esid foroe den nd pporter now reporter but some voters of color have a message to the democratic party pass over harris at your own risk what do you think black voters will do if the party passes over kamala harris for someone else is revolt a good word reporter a brandnew race for vote towers decide with days to go until the election the one thing that all the democratic voters that i have spoken to today lester seem to agree on is that the party needs to unify show some kind of camaraderie in the weeks as we head towards the dnc lester is biden dropping out and harris stepping up changing anyones minds reporter whats interesting is surveys show she is on par and slightly ahead of biden in matchups with trump even in critical swing states i spent a lot of time today with very young voters even new voters and some of them were skeptical of biden even uncertain about voting in the past and they say theyre very energized now they appreciate a younger candidate for energy they say they will get behind her this fall if shes the nominee i was watching with great from the conversations you were having with folks and there is kind of a snare testify that in the summertime during an election year people are not tuned in going about their business enjoying the summer what i heard there is people who are tuned in who understand the stakes and understand these candidates reporter i saw the same you know chris january sing asked me earlier were you the person to break the news to lots of people on the street in new york about what happened with president biden today i did not break news to anyone everyone got push alerts to their phone watching on twitter reacting in realtime tuning into our program and this is the youngest voters it is the oldest voters and everyone was bracing for this moment i think as weve seen the news drip out these last several weeks voters were primed for this and their emotions were all over the place one of the things i really heard especially from the older voters was a lot of gratitude for the president in some cases they spoke directly to him through our camera trying to say thank you for all that youve done in recent decades this is of course a democratic city so there is a lot more of that in new york than many other parts of the country but they were almost ready for no moment and now that is why i think theres so much of this pressure from those democratic voters that signal really i think to all of the members of the party right now who are watching and waiting to see where the chips fall they want there to be a sort of effort to unite clarity and they want to see that kind of unity and support we just saw at the rnc for republicans at the dnc soon antonia hilton thank you very much we want to go to ali vitali youre watching the talley if you will of people who are offering their endorsement to vice president harris what have you learned these endorsementing to keep coming in and theres many notable ones including from people inside the administration as well as other people who could have been thought of as potential challengers to the vice president now that she is in all effects the person that most democrats are looking at as the next likely nominee of course we are looking at people like transportation secretary pete buttigieg and others on the hill who are saying that harris is the person that should continue carrying the mantle of course all of this comes against the backdrop of as we were talking about the potential for other people to try to throw their name in the ring here i imagine in my conversations on capitol hill that while there might be some kind of an appetite for an open convention or a more open process there are more names now than i have ever heard in my history of covering harris wanting her to be the nominee wanting her to be the standard bearer and looking at this moment where roe v wade and abortion access have come to the fore ali vitali thank you our special coverage of president bidens historic announcement continues and how its already shaking up the campaign thats next reporting good evening from new york if you are just joining us after weeks of chaos and uncertainty in the democratic party joe biden the th president of the united states announced to the country he will end his campaign for reelection for a second term and immediately endorsed vice president kamala harris to take his place at the top of the ticket harris saying she is honored to have the presidents endorsement and her intention is to earn and win this nomination her words hinting at the process the party will have to go through to choose mr bidens successor the presidents announcing on social media falling growing calls by democratic lawmakers to step aside slip of poll numbers loss of donor support and also mr bidens repeated statements as recently as yesterday that he intended to go on with his campaign and win todays decision completely upends a presidential campaign already in turmoil after mr bidens debate performance less than one month ago former president trump was quick to react to mr bidens decision to end his campaign were covering it all on this consequential day in american history senior white house correspondent kelly odonnell now has late details reporter a sharp turn for history as president biden announced at pm there would be no last campaign for him i believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term in a separate statement the president embraced his vice president i want to offer my full support and endorsement for kamala to be the nominee for our party this year a move that attempts to blunt any effort to open the nomination process before the august convention the president had praised harris in a press conference that was intended in part to settle doubt about his candidacy look i wouldnt have picked vice president trump to be vice president because i think shes not qualified to be president lets start there reporter the vice president offered thanks to the bidens and made her intentions clear i will do everything in my power to unite the democratic party and unite our nation to defeat donald trump reaction tonight from former president barack obama who called joe biden a patriot of the highest order describing the decision as a testament to joe bidens love of country praise from bill and hillary clinton for his extraordinary career of service while highlighting their worry about the threat posed by a second trump term after a half century of public life his political brand was forged by being underestimated i know like many americans know when you get knocked down you get back up reporter the president had tried to save his shot at a second term i wouldnt be running again if i didnt believe with all my heart and soul i can do this job reporter but that did not quiet the pressure after that june debate performance look if we finally beat medicare reporter an extraordinary rupture followed a chorus of rejection that grew louder for weeks the president is not capable of delivering the message in an effective way when your strategy isnt working you cant double down you have to change your strategy joining me now kelly what an extraordinary day we have walked through what more are we learning about the presidents decision reporter well we understand he was huddled with his closest advisers and some members of his family at his home at the beach in delaware and the decision evolved over this weekend it was what they referred to as close hold meaning only the closest people were aware he was about to make this decision before he alerted his campaign and a limited number of senior officials and then the public what comes next the president of course is still dealing with covid as he gets better from that and he continues to take paxlovid we will expect to learn more when he will address the nation publicly that is expected some time this week and we also know that he and the vice president had multiple conversations today lester do we know if there was a p tipping point that led the president to make a final call reporter a combination of things based on our reporting where the president was basically looking at what are the chances we know the number of voices within the democratic party who had come out publicly to tell him they wanted him to step ase he had looked at his own situation of donors and inc chas in the support he was feeling from that group as a big part of it as you know from your conversation with him recently he had said million americans voted for him during the primary process and he wanted to listen to that he had referenced the lord almighty and his own wellbeing a medical issue could be things that could interfere with his quest to seek a second term ultimately he foundational polling was presented to him over the weekend that looked at how kamala harris would do against donald trump also looking at his own chances and the weight of all those combination of factors finally got the president to a place reluctantly and in a human way and disappointed way getting to this decision and timing incredibly important with the republicans just coming off of their convention where they showed unity democrats had been fractured over his debate performance and his age and now hes making a decision that can chart the course for his party its not set yet as you know there will definitely be some concerns but he has made his choice and well see more from him this week lester kelly thank you for your continued reporting at at white house im joined by meet the press moderator kristen welker how confident are the sources youre talking within the democratic party that kamala harris can clinch this nomination lester theyre confident and hopeful i just spoke with a top democratic lawmaker who said there is a new energy that has been infused into this race which has been totally upended donors are coming back and asking this person said where can they donate how quickly can they send their money it takes one big factor off the table lester remember that headtohead polling the fact that a majority of americans didnt want to see this matchup this rematch between biden and trump well now there is no rematch between biden and trump vice president kamala harris is to some extent the new face in this race now she has served as vice president but ive been talking to sources who say this is really a chance for hadder to reintroduce herself to the mesh people supporters believe shes found her voice from reproductive rights as well as voting rights for example so they are feeling energized one democrat said they are breathing a sigh of relief theres now someone to prosecute the case against former president trump i think youre going to hear that word prosecute a lot lester remember kamala harris is a former prosecutor she hails from the great state of california now i think she is going to lead in part with that part of her background that shes prosecuting the case against former president trump she just sent out her first fundraising email she writes in the coming days as i hit the campaign trail to meet americans and lay out the choice in front of voters in the fall i cannot imagine two more starkly different visions for where we want our country to go we can choose the dark path of project with less freedom and more division or we can choose to pull together and do the work for the people so in order to clinch this nomination im told theres going to be a virtual roll call the goal will be for her to get the nomination there if not if she falls short then you are going to see a lot of chaos but some democrats think it would be okay to have an open primary process they say the bottom line is lester there is new energy thats now been infused into this race it seems like its going to be a delicate dance she has to start raising that money as you suggested she has already put out an appeal but the same time she is probably waiting for the president to make his remarks publicly understand with his covid diagnosis his voice may not be up to it but it feels this could be a very awkward window were watching youre right about that lester think about it this entire period has been awkward to some extent for the vice president and the president we know as kelly just laid out he was looking at polling not just his own but polling for the vice president as well he wanted to see how she matches up against former president trump we know shes quietly been looking at some potential people she might want to pick as a running mate looking at a lot of those governors who hail from battleground states josh shapiro from pennsylvania senator mark kelly of arizona gretchen whitmer of michigan and of course another name that gets a lot of buzz governor gavin newsom from california tough to see two people running from california look just to give you a sense there are a lot of names right now and a lot of different moving parts that need to fall into place in order for democrats to head into chicago unified behind a nominee and a running mate lester thats the goal i am told will they be able to accomplish that that remains to be seen you and i were in milwaukee together lester and we continued night after night to talk about the unity that we witnessed within the republican party how stark that unity was as compared to the unity behind former president trump i think that added urgency to democrats to make this decision in short order because they know look theyre about four months out from election day and they have to get going if they want to take on trump kristen welker thank you for vice president kamala harriss entoersment by president biden and her potential path to the presidency represent the latest chapter in a political journey that began years ago in california hallie jackson be has more reporter the spotlight turning to kamala harris one of president bidens most vocal backers since that debate widely panned as disastrous it was a slow start theres no question about that but i thought it was a strong finish we are looking at a president in joe biden who has done historic work reporter now the presidents endorsement of harris puts her in a poll position to take the top of the ticket harris in a statement today saying in part i am honored to have the presidents endorsement and my intention is to win this nomination adding we have days until election day together we will fight and together we will win in recent days some of the presidents key allies have signaled if he were to step aside it is harris who should get democrats support this should not do anything to work around miss harris reporter congressman jim clyburn publicly backing harris with other democrats following suit the exception the partys top leaders in the house and senate stopping short of an endorsement but praising the president for his service whether its harris at the top of the ticket or not other democrats have been speculated to be in the mix perhaps as a running mate including california governor gavin newsom president biden doesnt run why shouldnt we consider you a likely candidate i think the vice president is naturally the one lined up reporter pennsylvanias shapiro gretchen whitmer and transportation secretary pete buttigieg harris ran for the white house three years later after i love my country and i feel a sense of responsibility to stand up and fight for the best of who we are reporter after being sleblgted as president bidens running mate she was tapped by the white house to lead the administrations root causes of the immigration crisis coming under fire for the white houses handling of the border and pressed by lester on the topic in weve been to the border you havent been to the border and i havent been to europe i mean i dont understand the point youre making im not discounting the importance of the border reporter harris has taken on abortion access slamming the gop for reproductive rights how dare they tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her own body how dare they reporter now a pivotal political moment for harris and the nation hallie jackson joins me now as well as chuck todd chief political analyst hallie let me start with you how critical for the democrats are these next to hours pretty critical i think its fair to say especially what youve seen even over the course of the last six to eight hours it has been somewhat remarkable the speed by which some of those names we mentioned in that piece you just watched those names of people who could potentially challenge kamala harris for the top of the ticket or become her running mate have come out and endorsed her were talking for example gavin newsom josh shapiro roy cooper has done the same an indication that the democratic party is moving quickly to try to solidify behind kamala harris to a degree to show that level of unity that you and kristen were talking about earlier as you look at notable endorsements for kamala harris including from such big names in the party as the clintons as congressman clyburn who is critical in getting president bidens campaign back in up and running and helping him win the nomination back then so for democrats theres a real question of how do they get unity quickly thats somewhat tempered i just had a conversation the idea they dont want this to look as though the process is moving so quickly that its leaving voters out i think there is a sense they want to make sure there is a process that includes the will of the voters that this does not appear its simply levers being pulled by top officials in the party here there is a significant i think nod to that as well i think the question is going to be what does the roll call look like i know chuck will get into the weeds with you on the delegate selection but what does the next four weeks tomorrow is the start of the democratic convention what does chicago look like lester chuck i was speaking to jason miller of the trump campaign its clear theyre going after the areas in which kamala harris was leading the administrations efforts including the border will they are they looking at a one size fits all attack plan or will they be a little off their game i think theyll be a little thrown off because you have an endorsement of someone who isnt afraid to say the word sometimes they were grumbling about president biden on this issue the language has changed on him from when from a majority of the time he was in office but i really think theyre going to go hard at border and try to define her as she was the person that pulled joe biden to the left theyll start saying harris was the one pulling him to the left thats why the combination of that and the border issue i think mark kelly and im hearing from more people close to her look shes got i think she ought to use this process to interview a wide range of people for the running mate position ive heard mark milleys name as well as admiral mcraven she ought to draw it out its a way for the country to get to know her sucks up a bit more oxygen mark kelly would probably be the running mate the trump campaign would fear the most because he would be there to neutralize on the border he was very critical constantly of both president biden and vice president harris on the border he had to coming from the state he comes from and then you have the intangible factors this is a family touched by political violence its one of those it reminds people that this is a bipartisan issue were trying to deal with is this an animating moment when you step back an animating moment for a party that just spent the last several days watching republicans in what at times felt like a love fest frankly i think its what increased the pressure on president biden to do what he did i think when you saw this is a very unified republican party the most unified arguably since george w bush in and this is there was a lack of energy there was a lack of enthusiasm weve been seeing it all year i think one of the unintended consequences of all of this is we had been heading to a very low turnout election the country had told us they didnt really want to see it the presidential debate which of course sparked all of this lester the lowest rated first presidential general election debate we ever had people were tuned into it people thought they already knew these guys all of a sudden theres a massive plot twist i think youll see more people engaged and its an opportunity for both former president trump and vice president harris because i think theres an extra group of voters who had sort of given up on the system they were giving them two unpopular candidates and they might take a listen hallie we have not seen the president come out he is still apparently suffering the effects of covid how important is that moment where we see him presumably with vice president harris in the rose garden or some other location yeah wherever it may be presuming hes appearing with the vice president its an important moment for the country its an important moment for democrats and also an important moment for history remember how extraordinary this is here this is a generational thing we havent seen anything like this that is to say there is anything like this when president biden addresses the nation whenever that may be at some point this week he will be essentially laying that down for the history books youre already hearing praise from democrats who are touting president biden as what hes doing as the ultimate act of selflessness youre hearing that from his family and key allies i imagine the president will strike that tone to a degree of course what do you do to pass the ball or pass the baton to his vice president to kamala harris does she appear alongside him does he give her that fullthroated endorsement with the back drop of course the important back drop of the white house of the oval office or rose garden or east room or wherever this may end up happening i think so many people will be watching that watching his tone his demeanor while he is with drawing from the ticket he is not leaving the white house he will continue of course to stay in that position of the presidency until the end of his term so there is still for lack of a better phrase here theres still business to be done theres still work to be done over the course of the next several months aside from the political campaign hallie thank you very much im joined by presidential historian jon meacham who has helped write key speeches for president biden have you spoken to the president today or at any point leading up to his decision i spoke to him today after the decision i learned about it with the rest of the world and i think what we should do as you have been doing is realize as hallie was just saying the magnitude of this yes theres the politics and yes were naturally going to be looking at what happens the day after and the day after tomorrow but what president biden did was a remarkable act of both patriotism and personal courage its very rare for anyone in any sphere of life to sacrifice something under whatever circumstances much less at the highest levels the pinnacle of temporal power he expected fate he likes to say hes a great respecter of fate and understand like president lincoln that president sentiment is everything with it you can do everything and without it you cant do anything this is a recognition of a of his duty i think to the country you said you spoke to him today i dont expect you to give full details of a private conversation but can you give us a sense of what his head space was like was he as combative and defiant as he was in the days leading up to this youre right i dont want to discuss a conversation i think the letter captures where he is remember president biden ive always felt this is rather like an upside down iceberg you see most of it and sometimes its perhaps for all of us theres some part we dont see but he has been doing this a very long time he looked at reality he made his decision and i think its exemplaar i dont mean to be sentimental or congratulatory as an historic matter very few people do this in an era where so many privilege power over principle where a lot of us would rather take than give i think its a moment for the country to consider that the president has given us a lesson that our own wishes our own immediate desires should not always be controlling he had apparently indicated to others that he didnt think him coming off the ticket would be the magic bullet that many thought he really thought he could win do you suspect theres a part of him that still thinks he could win i dont know i will say as my friends in tennessee the only cure for politics is embalming fluid so i cant really imagine that there are not that theres not something lets just be honest in his psychology of course hes been doing this for years and so political creatures are political creatures thats whats so amazing about the decision he made hes a politician who made a principled decision and id love to say that politicians always do that its been said of john f kennedys book profiles in courage theres a reason its short theres not a ton of examples in there you may have heard last monday that i sat down with the president for an interview one of the questions i asked him who does he rely on for counsel during crises like this he said he relies on himself did that surprise you you know him in ways i dont that was an interesting moment in your interview not really in terms of surprise think about it doing this a long time counted out again and again and again remember joe bidens life is one of remarkable victory years old youngest senator and then tragedy strikes his life unfolds with the expectation that hell be a very young president and the campaign implodes goes back to the senate he barrels down he almost resigned by the way the senate before he took the job he was going to go back to wilmington raise hunter and beau after the death of his wife and daughter his sister valerie was very much involved and that was going to be the story he wasnt going to go and was encouraged to do so not least by the incumbent senators at the time he likes to say it probably saved his life and so his and then he sorted counted out he has health issues in that era and loses in becomes vice president no expectation of that and in we thought the story was over right his son beau has died he has decided not to run for president in and that seemed to be the end of the story and then charlottesville happened and the unfolding still relevant threat was a compelling reason for him to step into the breach thats what he did for american democracy and for his vision of what the country should be remarkably successful legislative president i think im a biographer of george herbert walker bush i think president bidens handling of nato and ukraine ranks with some of our finest foreign policy moments ever you dont get much credit politically is what people like me do you dont get much credit for keeping bad things from happening politics doesnt reward that history has to reward that and so its a difficult thing sometimes to translate that kind of success into immediate political benefit thats just a perennial problem before i let you go as we noted you have written key parts of speeches for the president before will the speech he will ultimately give when hes healthy enough to go before the cameras will that be his toughest i cant see how it wouldnt be i will say this though and i think this might be important for all of us to bear in mind this is not the worst day of joe bidens life by a long long shot he has experienced more tragedy he has prevailed he has endured and he has served and i think the country should take a moment and reflect on that all right jon meacham thank you for coming on with us tonight appreciate it lets bring in nbc news capitol hill correspondent ryan nobles if you can bring us up to speed on the latest endorsements that have come in for vice president harris we just got a significant one in the last few minutes lester holt that is representative alexandria acasio cortez of new york a progressive figure among the group of democrats that was insistent that joe biden stay in the race one thing weve been tracking is whether or not progressive democrats would get behind kamala harris campaign she has now given kamala harris her fullthroated endorsement she joins a growing list of democrats that are rallying around kamala harris as the nominee of the democratic party they include gavin newsom the governor of california someone who might be considered as a candidate himself gavin newsom may be considered as kamala harriss running mate if it gets to that point we also saw endorsements from bill and hillary clinton congress map clyburn of south carolina whos a powerful member of the black caucus the governor of colorado has also endorsed josh shapiro the governor of pennsylvania considered a rising star in the democratic party someone we should watch as a potential running mate for kamala harris if shes able to win the nomination you also saw congressman adam schiff of california whos likely to become the next senator from california and closely aligned with nancy pelosi as well while weve seen a lot of democrats come forward and express support for kamala harris say she should be the nominee there are still am who believe this should be an open contest there should be the opportunity for other democrats to throw their hat in the ring as well some describing it as not wanting to be a coronation well have to watch this process play itself out as we head into the convention coming up next month thank you im joined by seth moulton of massachusetts he was one of the first to call on mr biden to end his campaign for reelection thank you for being with us you were among the first to make this call you have endorsed vice president harris are you feeling better about the future of your party right now absolutely this is a great day its a great day for our country its a great day for our party and its a great day for president biden i think this will burnish his legacy he will go down in history as someone who not only wielded great power but had the courage to give it up to pass on the torch to the next generation and hell be remembered fondly for this moment in addition to his decades of legislative accomplishments both in the white house and the senate but do you miss an opportunity if the party does not embrace the idea of an open vote to let others throw their hat in the ring if they wish im not opposed to an open vote at all ive proudly endorsed vice president harris i think shes ready to go shes been training being in the white house for four years she can tap right into all the biden campaign resources that hes accumulated this amazing infrastructure across the country of course theres not that much time shes going to show americans she has an incredible vision for the future of our country in contrast to donald trumps dark vision of taking us backwards having said that my endorsement for her doesnt mean there shouldnt be an open process i think the democratic party has shown here that unlike the republican party we are willing to respond to americans concerns three out of five americans say they didnt want trump or biden to be the nominees one party has said we hear you america were making a change can you do a campaign can a campaign be done that quickly given youre right theres a lot of cash potentially available but in terms of covering the territory finding a running mate what does that look like in many ways thats why the vice president is so well positioned to take the reins here and run with them and she has a lot of that infrastructure she has that experience of being in the white house yes there is time lester because the contrast is so great this is not running against someone like mitt romney this is running against donald trump his very dark vision for the country the project things taking rights away from women bringing us back to the s i mean this is not a vision that most americans want to embrace so i think theres plenty of time for the vice president or whoer the nominee is to show that massive contrast with trump ultimately win the election congressman thank you for taking time to be with us its good to talk to you good to be with you lester well talk to congressman james clyburn who played a big part in getting president biden elected about whats next for the future of the democratic party thats after this welcome back to our coverage president bidens win in the democratic primary hinged largely on the support of one man south carolina congressman jim clyburn he helped secure the nomination for president biden when he ran four years ago and the congressman is good enough to join us this evening thank you for being with us sir thank you for having me have you spoken to the president today yes i have can you give me a sense of your kvrgts and where his head space is tonight well i think its in his letter the president called me early yesterday before even he went to the public with his announcement when i asked him a few questions he read me read to me from the letter and its the best time he would send in a second statement expressing his endorsement for kamala harris he knew for a long time of where i stood with this i always told him that he had my full support and i was not going to change my mind unless he changed his and so he called me earlier today and told me he had changed his mind and was not going to run congressman are you disappointed i dont mean disappointed necessarily in vice president harris but are you disappointed that it has come to this well you know joe biden is a longtime friend of mine we developed this friendship over a period of time he being from delaware we have similar backgrounds growing up and we often talked about that and brown v board of education the court decision that changed the direction of this country the brown was five cases from in the district of columbia one of those states was in south carolina one much those states was delaware thats how we met discussing brown and what led to brown and the similarities between the states of delaware and south carolina and he used to spend most of his time here in south carolina so i grot to know him well i think hes one of the best public servants we ever produced in this country so yes im disappointed that his career has come to this kind of an end but i just think its coming a little soon but its the kind of career that anybody would be proud to have years do you think the party is staged is in a position to win now based on what has occurred oh i think so yes its all about the future and when we get beyond labor day were going to go through this process we dont go to convention until the th of august well come out of there four five days later and then everybody will take their breaks for the holiday after labor day we are going to take this campaign to the american people drawing a contrast between the vision that the democrats have for the future of this great country and that which we see on the other side of the aisle project is a document that is a blueprint for what the republican party would like to see the future of this country be that is a future without the safety nets thats made this country as great as it is but for social security coming out of the great depression in the s where would this country be when we have people committing their total lives to making this a great country then they find themselves in their golden years not able to fend for themselves they want to get rid of social security at least this document says raise the retirement age from to who retires earlier working men and women when it comes to a life span its a little different than if youre working all your life in an air conditioned office congressman these guys on the other side have no sensitivity for the working men and women and we are going to be able to draw the comparison in the campaign and win this election we noted you endorsed kamala harris the vice president to get the nomination is she being served well or is the democratic party being served well if there is not an open process if theres the hint or suggestion this is more of a coronation the process is open its open ever since the spring of the year we put in the process by which anybody who wants to go get into this race and its open you get signatures right now get signatures and you can have your name placed into the nomination and then you politic among the delegates like everybody else with i said that from the very beginning when i was first talking about should we have a mini primary i said you dont need a mini primary our rules committee put in a process which is akin to having a mini primary what difference would you have if you have to run outside of this process we have rules and when you saw changes to the rules thats when you get in trouble with people the rules are there theyre open theyre transparent and you can see them thats what all do follow the rules finally can you talk to me reflect if you will on the potential history that could be made here a woman of color ascending to the presidency well this country has always been about seeking perfection you cannot have a more perfect union and a mission from the very beginning that we are not a perfect nation but we are always in pursuit of perfection this is just another step in that direction this country has been around for a long time compared to a lot of the european countries not a long time but a pretty long time we have been in existence since and we have never had a woman to hold this office that is unlike the european countries where we grew out of so we will be making history if we were to be successful and whats wrong with that that is what this country is all about pursuing perfection this will be another step in that direction i do believe we are going to do that come november congressman clyburn always a pleasure to speak with you thank you for being with us tonight thank you very much for having me with president biden out of the race now were taking a look at what the polls show in a headtohead matchup between vice president kamala harris and former president trump nbc news national political correspondent steve kornacki joins me now to kind of walk us through it all lester that is the strategic question for democrats they were concerned about joe bidens ultimate ability to win this election if they do end up with kamala harris as their presidential candidate now does it change the basic political realities they were worried about look at it this way this is the average of all of the national polls connected since that debate at the end of june that started all this you see the average biden trailing trump by two points nationally very significant not just that biden was behind but if you went back four years to there really was no point in the entire campaign when biden trailed trump in the national average that made that even more significant since that debate these polls have started to ask well what about kamala harris as the democratic nominee the polls that have tested both of them heres the average for harris versus trump not much different harris does do a point better than biden goes to in the average trump stays at at least at the beginning if democrats do go with harris they would be taking a candidate trailing by two on average replacing with a candidate who trails by one on average the question is the introduction of kamala harris as a presidential candidate the democratic convention the new attention on her would that help those numbers would that improve them conversely would that hurt those numbers potentially if the rollout doesnt go that well thats the starting point on headtohead we also look at the basic imable of each candidate when we look at the question favorable or unfavorable view the average for joe biden has been very bad favorable unfavorable now kamala harris where does she clock in here a little bit a little bit better but not much to on the favorable side and the unfavorable comes down to donald trump who she would like to run against now you see where he stands these numbers are a bit better than they have been favorable unfavorable whether its kamala harris or if it happens to be anybody else whoever emerges as the democratic candidate the basic challenge theyre facing is this here is the road to electoral votes you see the six core swing states right here that are expected to decide the presidency you see harris would have to win a number of those states here the other challenge for her and something that drove biden from this race is democrats were starting to get indications outside of these battleground states of unexpected trouble in places like virginia new hampshire maine in the popular vote in maine they give electoral votes by congressional district there even potentially in a state like minnesota so for harris or whoever the democratic nominee becomes the two challengers shore up states like that that democrats werent expecting to have to sweat over and then get to work in those battleground states again all those battleground states in were joe biden states lester steve kornacki thank you our special coverage our look at bidens more than half a century in public service and what this decision means for the next chapt we are back with our special coverage of president biden ending his campaign for reelection lets bring in senior legal correspondent laura jarrett what happens to bidens campaign war chest the assumption it goes to harris but its not that official because donors made contributions to them sort of as partners there could be an argument i think by her that that was their intent weve already seen republicans coming out tonight saying they might want to challenge this saying shes not necessarily guaranteed to the money since she wasnt at the top of the ticket so we should watch for lawsuits could the lawsuits trying to get them to return the money yes back to the dnc or the donors and the donors could redonate to harris she has already filed the necessary paperwork and a progressive donation platform said it raised million already within the first five hours of her being announced lester democrats already mobilizing around her all right laura thank you lets bring in former us senator and nbc news claire mccaskill claire former senator kamala harris officially of course running for president could we see any democrats challenge her well you know as jim clyburn said theyre welcome to kamala harris was chosen by joe biden to be there in case he ever needed to step aside as president and she was on the ballot and gained the votes of million democrats in the primary process so youre seeing today i think lester in some ways almost a surprising coalescence to people who arent watching this carefully by the democratic party around kamala harris the leaders have held off wanting to make sure nobody thought this was being forced down anyones throats but anybody can step up and try to challenge at the convention the delegates have been released but i have a feeling that our convention the democratic partys convention is going to be very united behind kamala harris mark how does this historic shake up change donald trumps calculations i dont think it changes it that much lester kamala harris owns the same horrible policies that made joe biden the most unpopular president in years whether its on energy inflation the southern border even foreign relations i dont see a policy change i dont see kamala harris suddenly coming out and saying drill baby drill or lets do something about the border those are big issues on the minds of the american people so i think the campaign will stay the same and the name on the bumper sticker were running against is the only thing that changes i was at the republican convention last week covering the activities there watching the unity there thinking what happens if democrats you know are able to get to the place they can have some unity and excitement they seem to be from what were seeing here tonight beginning to have that should that be a worry for the republican party well usually both parties come out of their conventions fairly unified i fully expect that after their convention they will be behind whomever their nominee is and then its a race to the finish line i think when you look at the electoral college map when you look at the polling right now its all in favor of donald trump and i dont think just changing out to kamala harris or anyone else is going to provide that big of a bump because remember the final margin in was in the national vote it was only votes in three states in the electoral college so theyre way behind where they need to be right now and claire the vice president is now officially a candidate for the presidency her actions and movements in this next couple of days how critical are they are there some trap as long the way she should be aware of this is going to be a difficult process its a sprint rather than a marathon i think the american people really dont love long campaigns anyway ive got to tell you on policies lester remember all the democratic senators in the battleground states are winning in the polls the policies are not the problem and i think with this now a youthful candidate compared to a very old candidate a prosecutor versus someone who has been prosecuted i like the contrast the fact that she has so quickly emerged though and received all these endorsements is there going to be a window here in other words are folks going to have to declare very very quickly where they are on this well if theres going to be a credible challenge to her i think it would have to emerge in the next hours obviously if somebody was really going to challenge her at the convention they have a lot of work to do the fact youre seeing all the candidates that were talked about as potential presidential candidates almost all of them have already endorsed her i really dont think there is going to be anyone credible thats going to emerge now its a matter of her getting organized her getting her team together and her making sure she stays focused on and that is the american people and what they want for the future as opposed to retribution grievance and revenge mark very quickly at the end of the day s this going to change the dynamic in a big way in your view no it will give a new shot of energy to the democrats temporarily but i think its going to come down to the policies in the end and i think thats where the trouble lies for kamala harris or whomever takes the nomination thank you both for being with us finally he has been a fixture in american politics for more than half a century president bidens historic decision to end his campaign for reelection is what may be the final chapter in a stoert of a political giant tonight president bidens decision to drop his bid for reelection a stunning and abrupt end to a five decade long political career the president stepping aside under immense pressure from fellow democrats who feared he could not repeat his performance of four years ago when he narrowly defeated former president trump to help me god he had waited longer than any other commander in chief to achieve his lifelong ambition elected to the senate at age in weeks later a tragic car accident my wife and three children were christmas shopping tractortrailer broadsided them and killed my wife and killed my daughter he led the controversial confirmation hearings of clarence thomas featuring sexual harassment allegations from anita hill is this what you anticipated this no not at all and as senator he helped pass the landmark violence against women act in thencandidate barack obama tapped him to be his running mate later vice president biden famously caught on a hot mic celebrating the passage of the affordable care act this is a big bleep deal he pushed president obama to support samesex marriage by showing his support first i am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men women marrying women are entitled to the same exact rights after his son beau died of brain cancer joe biden said he didnt think about running for president again in until he saw donald trump enter the race were in a battle for the soul of this nation that january he told me he had the experience to unite the country as the next president of the united states is going to inherit a divided country the question is who is best prepared at this moment to be able to deal with both of those crises that seems like a bold statement from any politician in this environment to suggest you can heal the depths of division in this country we have to lester if we dont were in deep trouble later that year we spoke at a town hall after his first debate with then president trump im used to bullies i used to stutter when i was a kid i learned how to fight it democrats celebrated his win over mr trump and as president he had success overseeing the end of a pandemic and passing an historic bipartisan infrastructure law okay here we go yeah but he also struggled with low approval ratings a record number of migrants crossing the border and soaring inflation something i pressed him about you said inflation was going to be temporary i think a lot of americans are thinking what your definition of temporary is well youre being a wise guy with me a little bit and there would be much more conversation for now that concludes nbc news special reporting well continue on our

denver doesnt count dying as a negative outcome of homelessness initiative,the revelation comes as the mayor of denvers office also isnt answering questions about how much the house initiative,we learned something shocking about denvers homelessness initiative today not the cost no mayors office still cant explain that to us or to city council but as city council question where all the money is going thats when we learned that denver doesnt count someone dying to be a bad outcome of the homelessness initiative heres mark salinger all right great uh so the agenda that we have today we are going to be getting a briefing and we have an action item we came to denver city council in search of answers what we found were more questions from everyone what is the monthly cost on average for the hotel site is million needed was it needed for the first house goal so we are looking at actuals of million in we just need to see that this feels really incomplete to me um and then its a simple question really or at least we think so how much is the mayors house homelessness initiative costing we thought wed find out at this presentation titled house financials we didnt our actual expenses in came in much lower than we had anticipated only million were spent in million is the only real number the mayors office can give for how much money has been spent so far but we know more than million has already been approved by city council so wheres all the money going we arent the only ones asking help me understand and not be so shocked that you only spent million the story that next has been telling you about for days now has the attention of other cameras today we also learned the vast majority of people exiting house shelters are leaving to be homeless again go to jail or even d do we have an idea of why we are seeing that of the people who are exiting are exiting into a negative outcome so just want to start with talking about outcomes we and our partners dont count deceased as a negative outcome there are many reasons why people im not sure im comfortable with that while the city doesnt count death as a negative outcome lets say more positive outcomes seem hard to come by of the roughly people who moved into hotels or micro communities after living on the streets the citys dashboard says only have left with leases of their own for permanent housing how are we going to improve our outcome rate because you know were spending a significant amount of dollars tax dollars um we have to be able to say to our taxpayers that we are using those dollars wisely and i i want to be very theres been at least two shootings seven deaths and around calls to the former doubletree hotel in central park thats now being used as a shelter today we learned that shelter is operating with about staff there are about open positions right now safety has always been a concern there but we had no idea kyle that theyre operating at such short staff explain this to me again how somebody can end up dead in denvers homeless shelter and thats not a negative outcome so i wanna make sure that i get this right so were gonna read it the primary reason that the city says they dont count dying as a negative outcome is because they say someone is dying inside which is better than dying frozen outside some of these people were killed right like they were killed in the shelter that is the quote primary reason good lord all right mark thanks,0.0

internal negative news buscom c,the employees in front of you can be the toughest audience for you to deliver negative news it can be painful devastating for,slow opening music internal negative news oh this is the toughestone probably of all telling the boss something went wrong i did it oh my gosh okay confronting an employeeabout poor performance especially if they work daily with you on a regular basis weve got a problem here announcing decliningprofits lost contracts lawsuits public relations controversies changes in policies none of these are fun youre arent going to feelgood that day in the process decide whether the negative information is worth mentioning sometimes it depends leave trivial noncriminal mistakes and onetime bad behaviors alone but report fraudulent travel claims because a lot of peoplemay do the same practice consistent hostile behavioror failing projects if multitude of people are out there sometimes you must reportit as you go through use an indirect strategy if you know that the receiveris going to be upset when it comes to groups or individuals as you go through gather all the informationbefore you make your decision prepare and rehearse think about the impact out there and practice as to howyoure going to go out saying that sometimes youneed to write a script as you go through i recommend that if youhavent done it before explain the past present and future and then consider taking a colleague now by the way on the counting issue multiple times ivehad people in my office and their job is to sit there and be quiet and take notesabout whats going on and the employee sayswhy is that person here theyre just here so we take notes ive had people come into my office ive had the employee anda union rep in my office we came to a meeting of theminds how we would handle it and then ive had bothof those people go out and say something different they lie sometimes that happens in real life so make certain youhave an insurance policy the insurance policymay be a silent observer who take notes of what happens you have a witness in the process so consider taking a colleague think about timing sometimes if you havesomething thats ongoing sometimes theres days you dont do it and sometimes there are days that you do it just depends what works out right and so think about thetiming and the wait and then be patient with a reaction if you deliver bad news people get upset okay so sometimes youneed to sit down there and just relax and dontoverreact back to them as theyre reacting toyou as you go through this is an article from gustavo razzetti he talks about different aspects of it about the fear of change so when the brains face uncertainty it creates certainty sometimes we prefer to stay in our comfort zone sometimes when you stepoutside of your comfort zone youre terrified because youdont know what that means you know what the directionyoure going to go but of a sudden they haveall these things percolate in the back of your head sometimes they put a brandnew empty desk in the office what does that mean oh theres a new desk are they getting rid of somebody is that somebody me theyre bringing somebody else in what about my duties will i be you make things up if you dont know sometimes theres a fear of failure sometimes you sit downno one wants to fail so if i do this new thingi may fail in the process your fears can get you stuckand help you grow though okay so fear of losing our position sometimes we provide answers but sometimes its the matter of if you find the answer for somebody else your value to theorganization is diminished and youre worried about youbecoming diminished over time we fear change because wererelegated to a secondary role were not in the drivers seat somebody else could occupythe seat that we held two months before fear of change could be fearof inadequacy as you go down we all feel at some pointor the other this way either because were too perfectionist or because we compare ourselves to others the grass is always greener but sometimes the grass is actually brown but you cant see it on theother side of the fence facing the unknown questionsabout our convictions are we up to the challenge and that sometimes im already worked i dont want to have any more work you make this change over here my life will be miserable sometimes youre chainedbecause of that as well so think about those five things in the aspect of why peopleare fearful of change as you go through a lot of times low morale results whenthey learn bad news through the grapevine so be open about it explain the organizationsside honestly and properly as you go through smart organizations usuallycommunicate the news openly and with bad newsdelivered to individuals management may want todeliver the news personally in my opinion thats alwaysthe best way of doing it you dont want to sit downand blindside your employees be upfront with them and sometimes deal with the employees then send it out on a regular basis always use a buffer as you open into it give the reasons behind it and then the bad news buffer reasons bad news close buffer reasons bad news close buffer reasons bad newsclose in the process so closing thoughts a negative announcement can be delivered in a caring fashion sit down there and deal with the issue and dont damage the person involved treat people with dignity and respect it goes a long way towardsearning the respect of others in the workplace as you go through so the five types of fear they extend past this classroom they extend into reallife on a regular basis even tough measures can be discussed without condemnation orjudgment of the person ive gone through and ive worked with at least five people that are addicted to alcoholin some way shape or form of the five three of them really dontreally care about me yes or no one of them adores me to this end and one of them hates meforever in the process but each time ive dealt with them i had to deal with the issueof the work performance not them or their personal issue in the process as you go through deal with the issue that concerns work and everything else will sit down and straighten itself out in the process as you go through tell them before thegrapevine tells them as well as you go through on bad news with that take care slow closing music,0.0

how do we find hope and resilience joining me now is the perfect person to answer that question eddie glove hes the former president of the american academy of religion current chair of the department of african american studies at princeton university and he hosts the podcast history is us eddie in the face of everything that i just reeled off what is our hope lifeline us im delighted to be with you but its us its always been us part of understanding the history of this country is to understand the extraordinary capacities of ordinary people that the miraculous happens in the everyday doings and sufferings of folk who are not heros but who can do her roaric thingsthingheroic things right now were relitigating the revolutions of the mid th century theres an attack on voting rights thats an attack on the black freedom struggle theres an attack on womens rights the dont say gay laws in florida thats an attack on the gay liberation movement those folks on the street in the mid th century who risked everything to hold america to its promise in some ways to force the country to imagine itself differently we are their inher tantitance inheritance we inherit what theyve done we have to have faith in ourselves in this moment thats so dark that we can get to the other side of the storm our hope has to be us thats my thats the only truth we can hold on to right now you mentioned recently that the fabric of the country has shredded i believe as i think you do as well from what i hear that our country was made from a metal much stronger than the hatred and division thats plaguing so many of our institutions you mentioned the idea that theres this repetition of history im not going to do the saying justice theres an idea that we are doomed if were repeating the failures that were doomed and were not going to be able to move forward with progress if were still fighting the same fights we did centuries ago what can we be doing then in our own communities perhaps in our own backyards to make us feel like were doing some good for the world i think we have to grow up what that means is that we have to be honest about who we are we like to tell ourselves the story that america is the redeemer nation that we are an example of democracy thats not true i think part of what we have to do is confront the ugliness of who we are and what weve done even as we understand how whats possible in this grand franl jil fragile experiment theres a powerful phrase that says america changes all the time without ever changing at all william faulkners phrase the past is not dead the past is not even past so part of what it involves is telling the truth about who we are understanding that the country as it is these contradictions the inequality the social discord is a result of unresolved problems that have haunted the nation since its beginnings to confront that fact and imagine america as it should be close to the ground so i think part of the work we have to do is tell ourselves the truth that inequality in terms of the wealth gap the after chooe achievement gap the criminal justice system the education system we can go down the line these are reflections of policy choices that we made deliberate policy choices if were going to imagine ourselves differently we have to be just as deliberate in dismantling it as we were in creating it that seems to be what we need to do in our communities close to the ground theres a wonderful phrase that brian stevenson uses he says truth and reckononciliat are sequential first you have to tell the truth in order for there to be reconciliation and reconciliation lays the groundwork for repair thats what we need to do it seems to me we have the gift of your voice your thoughts as you teach and as you appear on the network you also have this new podcast i would be remiss in not mentioning it history is us what was the mission behind that podcast and why did you include the particular voices that you did thank you so much for asking that i was struck by january th i was particularly struck not only because the confederate flag was flying in the capitol the peoples house but senator ted cruz on the floor of the senate invoked the presidential election of as a framework for responding to the controversy around the election of the presidential election of was one of the most corrupt moments in us political history it ushered the compromise ushered in the compromise of that compromise eventually gave us the electoral count act all of that it also signaled the end of radical reconstruction it is the kind of symbolic end of radical reconstruction and the beginning of the racial dark ages of this country a moment thats defined by extraordinary political violence a moment in which the nation turns its back on the possibility of us being a multi racial democracy i wanted to tell a story i wanted to go back from january th to radical reconstruction tell a story about how that moment failed move to the mid th century tell the moments about what we did and how that moment failed in order to give us a sense of where we are in our current moment the storms always seem to come i think a good sense of history will help us i think as we try to imagine our way through the current storm that were experiencing now thats why i did the podcast over six episodes theres a reason why i wanted to have you on today its for me personally its a reflection of many of us its been a struggle its been a struggle for so long i hope we have the strength to embrace the honesty about who we are how we found ourselves here but to kind of you know jump off of what you just said theres storms but in between those storms theres light and there is good and there is positivity and we can weather those storms if we do it together i think if we are honest about who we are well be able to get there thank you again for your time,0.0

the and were back in the presence of a true legend golf superstar tiger woods the numbers certainly speak for themselves ranked world number one pga tour victories so far majors so far including green jackets and perhaps those jackets got him thinking because tigers newest title performance and apparel company hes the owner of it sunday red tiger good to see you man we have so much history yeah we do we have been playing golf together grew up years in southern california both of our fathers meant a tremendous amount to our lives in our golf development when we grew up golf wasnt cool yet no no if you played golf you were definitely not a cool kid girls would be like whats that i get it what are your earliest memories of just your childhood in so cal playing golf i grew up on public courses any time we got an scga tournament on a country club it was like oh my god i get to go to a country club and play golf so my relationship with golf is public golf and then eventually got into some of the i couldnt believe they cut the greens almost every day at a country club im used to coming on monday only and watching it just kind of grow through that entire week but no it was it was good the fact that we had so many junior golf tournaments as you know during the summer that we were able to play competitive golf most of the cool kids were surfing and doing the california stuff some great memories playing with you scottie scheffler nelly kor da were seeing some real special out of the last events they have won what do you see when you see scottie playing in particular for scottie his iconic foot movement is is belies what the club is actually doing through the golf ball how good it is how stable it is how solid he hits it stand back and hit the ball flight there is something different about his it is so consistent it works in both ways both ways it is just a matter of if he putts you know decent you know hes going to win if he putts great he blows away fields if he has a putting week he contends he is just that good a ball striker i see some of the young guys even when theyre playing with you competitively they seem to want to get in your ear other than technique and swing what would surprise us about what some of the guys ask you some of the stuff is can i be said other things are golf related and being how did i do it how did i do it for so long or even why did i do it why did i make changes to my game some of them are just trying to get better just like i was saw you and charlie your son for those that dont know hes fantastic hes trying to qualify for a few events tell me about that relationship on the course i have a teenager that doesnt want to hear anything out of my mouth about his golf swing okay do you coach are you dad he will listen to you about broadcasting right yeah thats the same thing he listens to me about golf but anything else outside of that because i dont know anything else even then there is a little pushback in golf which is totally cool hes years old it is what happens what teenagers go through they are trying to find their own place in the world i get it charlie on the range with you he had a club he was holding in front of you like this it looked like the two of you are working together on a swing we are it is just like being at home when were practicing at home im trying to keep the club tight to my body im trying to keep my arm path tight to my body and not let it run on basically getting my hips to move i have struggled with my hips moving and especially since my accident my right leg doesnt work that well so i have a hard time with that i tend to slide when i slide i hit these blocks and get that out of my system he puts the club there i saw sam there on the bag too that was at pnc yeah that was different she doesnt want to play golf no how come she has a negative connotation to the game because at that time you know hey growing up when she was growing up golf took daddy away from her i had to pack and i had to leave and id be gone for weeks and there is a negative connotation to it so we develop our own relationship our own rapport outside of golf that we do things meanwhile my son and i do everything golf related it is just very different you said at the beginning the idea was to play a tournament at a month im happy to does that time line still are you readjusting i have the next three months i have three majors and hopefully it will work out how do you feel physically sore what do you do cold plunge every playday religiously for those watching the today show we have sunday

buckle up for brutally negative general election guy benson,fox news contributors guy benson and james freeman react to the super tuesday election results and weigh in on what to,thanks bill on standby there in south carolina thank you dana and james freeman and guy benson are here now guy can we get your take from last night as you wake up this morning to the news that nikki haley has said all right enough is enough well im not really surprised because she had telegraphed in previous election speeches that she wasnt going anywhere in iowa and new hampshire and beyond saying were going to go to this place next were spending money here and were going to keep fighting there was none of that rhetoric ahead of last night really and certainly that silence that bill just talked about i think spoke volumes and now we have this expected result look she fought hard she represented a lot of voters not nearly enough but a lot of them and she put up a valiant effort she won a couple of primaries some thought she would win zero hats off to her now this is going to become a very long and in some ways excruciating general election and last night my biggest takeaway dana was watching the speech from president trump it was exclusively a general election speech his main messages the country was better off you were better off when i was president across these various metrics and issue sets and a lot of voters not even just his base agree with that on the other side joe biden no speech no event a prewritten statement they hit send basically around pm eastern time when the candidate might have been asleep by that point just saying donald trump is unacceptable we got to save democracy these are the themes were going to hear for the next eight months bill ok guy thank you for that james the people in the republican party spoke pretty loudly they want trump to be the nominee as you said hes kind of pivoted to the general election campaign and unfortunately the statement from joe biden was largely an attack on donald trump and i think this is a moment people have been talking about what donald trump needs to hear from voters i think joe biden would do himself and the country a world of good by now saying lets call off the law fare against president trump well let voters decide he should tell his attorney general merrick garland enough of these cases some of which im obviously guilty of as well it would i think be a wonderful moment to heal the country and also good for biden this is not a prediction bill do you think thats possible part of the reason that were here today implausibly perhaps with donald trump as the nominee again is people look at him and they see flaws but they say the abuses of his opponents are worse and i think all of these court cases target him has a lot it do with him cruising to barring a weird event the nomination in a few weeks dana one of the things that biden said in his statement was that are we really going to go back to the days where were in chaos because of donald trump i actually think voters are trying to signal to the pollsters and all of us that they feel like its chaos now like they dont feel secure they dont feel steady and there were some warning signs for president biden even in places like texas where the democrats have been trying to make certain gains over the years with hispanic voters what do the democrats take away from last night well i think thats such an important point because yes a lot of american voters associate chaos with trump thats part of his personality it was certainly one of the words that characterized his four years as president but you look around look at the border look at the middle east look at ukraine look at peoples pocketbooks and inflation look at crime in some of our major cities chaos very much reigns in a lot of ways under president biden so i think just saying the other side are chaos agents im not sure thats going to really fly in that same statement that biden and his team put out they were talking about some of their achievements and accomplishments theyll give lip service to that most voters arent buying it as weve seen in a lot of the polling theyre deeply dissatisfied with the incumbents performance make no mistake the next eight months will be the biden campaign saying the other guy is totally unacceptable and the trump campaign basically making the mirror argument so its going to be a brutally negative campaign and yeah the democrats should be nervous about some elements of their base that appear to be unhappy or maybe not terribly excited about joe biden and in some cases maybe peeling off back to trump as we saw in that new york times poll this week bill ralph norman is a republican from south carolina he was i think the only elected official in the entire state that did not get behind donald trump everybody else did on this whole nikki haley point a lot of people think the nerves right now are raw this stuff can heal easily and norman made that point that you know shes going to fall in line maybe the best example is just how rancorous it got with hillary clinton and barack obama they seemed to do ok in the end right she became a cabinet member coming up here minutes from now what would you expect from nikki haley well i guess im not expecting it but im hoping that if she wants to have a future in the republican party if she wants to influence the party this year and ultimately be a presidential candidate in a future year i think she should endorse donald trump maybe that doesnt happen today maybe it happens later if shes ruling out a third party run which she seems to be doing i think to your point there is an argument as she has talked about reasonably the need for unity and reaching out to different voters who dont necessarily love donald trump i think she might set an example as well because you know there was a message to her as well last night we can talk about the sort of phrase in the coalition for trump but the message was pretty clear to her in a lot of states that they prefer trump this time dana theres throughout the campaign i thought she had a real clarity of purpose and she was one of the first to bring up that this election really is about going against kamala harris and it was something i think that a lot of people picked up on and maybe youll hear a little bit more of that from her today but clarity of purpose from the campaign up until today when shes going to suspend bill gentlemen th,0.0
why does negative news sells more than the positive news aditi shrivastava tbcy,s e aditi shrivastava founding lead of elevate and the captable introduction about aditi shrivastava,welcome to another episode of the brand called you a vodcast and podcast show that brings you leadership lessons knowledge experience and wisdom from thousands of successful individuals from around the world im your host ashutosh garg and today im delighted to welcome a senior journalist from india aditi shrivastava aditi welcome to the show thank you thank you so much very excited to be here thank you aditi is the founding lead of elevate and the cap table shes worked with reuters the economic times and stellaris venture partners so before we get into what youre doing now you say speed makes a good story velocity makes an outcome please explain this is with an example or maybe an anecdote got it so this is actually something that you know i have learned from shane parrish like ive read a lot of his work on mental models and this was something that i sort of took home and largely because as a journalist i see this all the time that you know we are reading a lot of stuff which you know is so much about speed and its so much about you know what next growth at all costs all of that and when you step back and you see how some of the biggest companies or the most defensible brands were made they have been made you know on velocity and not speed so ill step back a little bit right like people often mistake speed and velocity so i would say velocity is not equivalent to speed right velocity is speed vector and how fast someone can get something somewhere so its possible that you move two steps forward and then if you move two steps back then the speed but theres zero velocity so like in my personal life ive seen that so much like i go on crash diets for example right that you know lose weight in days what does that really mean you know you lose kilos you gain them back in the next you know month or so its speed but its not an outcome right now i take that a little forward to you know business like i cover ecommerce so ive seen how an amazon or flipkart has grown right so to understand this so for example an amazon will make you know fulfillment centers they will make their own delivery fleet they will make processes these are all things that compound over the years and you know what you get to see as a consumer at the end of the day is that your shipment gets delivered next day or in four hours etc etc that is because speed has come with velocity right like its come with vector and its moving towards a certain direction and then you will also see a lot of the new companies right they come and you know they move fast they break things they burn a lot of money they get to the headlines i fall for it we all fall for it that you know how is this possible and then a year later you will see that you know companies are downsizing you know unit economics are not sustainable so it keeps sort of getting you back to that thing that you know its not the same thing and what makes a billion dollar outcome is a very different capability than what it is to you know move fast day things and both sort of for me it is literally about practicing that in daily life and remembering that and being conscious of that you know as i meet people and as i learn that how do i make differences in you know the way i think or my behavior or my habits in such a way that it has velocity and its not just about speed i think thats where i get it from its actually from shane parrish and his mental models book but this was something that really stuck with me because i think this is something that again is about velocityfascinating so lets talk a little bit about the cap table right tell me a little bit about this venture so we are basically a bunch of journalists who work with mainstream media and we decided that the startup ecosystem the india tech ecosystem is so vibrant at this point and then a lot of people are interested in understanding a little bit more in depth about what is happening in the indian ecosystemhow are some of the top companies being built out who are the people on the top how india is evolving into like you know startup tech hub and we thought that there was a gap where there was a lot of potential for meaningful long form insights on the market and we were very lucky that at the same point where you know we thought this way you know shradha from your story she gave us the opportunity to say guys why dont we just build this and you know she started her journey years back and her journey was all about you know telling stories that matter because at that point that was what mattered to tell entrepreneurial stories and today we were at that point where we said that you know along with that we also need to do a little additional reporting and a little you know we need to move the narrative forward from this telling stories to being like a optimistic critic of sorts i think thats how cap table was founded and the ethos remains the same that journalists are madly in love with the idea of india startup tech ecosystem being one of the largest in the world and how do we cover it in the most holistic manner and yeah i think thats what drives us amazing so you know over the years journalism has changed quite dramatically right and i remember you know im much much older but i remember you know when i was a year old in the late s early s you know there would be a few superstar journalists and we would read what they said and they would give their opinion and we accepted it today the entire you know news has become democratized and therefore i can form my own opinion i would love to get your perspective on how has journalism changed over the years so i love the fact that you know people and other journalists thats what i want i want to be the writer who gives you all the information and gives you all the context and i want to leave it on you to form your opinion and you know make those long threads on twitter to say you know hey this is what i hear and this is what i make out of it so i think the number of platforms to express your opinion have dramatically increased at the end of the day you know at least when i say and i started with reuters right and reuters was like completely by the book you you know one word here there which could sort of sway you know in a particular direction was measured you know very carefully so i come from the school of thought that you know i need to do all my research and present the facts as they are and let the readers decide and let them talk about it and let them have their own voice so im very happy about so youll see me very very rarely will you see me having a very strong opinion on something and that also comes from being a startup and a tech reporter because its data centric you i mean every three years you will be proven wrong so if you say yes that you wrote three years back yeah chances are its already been disrupted so you already know that you know you cant do it all like you have to sort of evolve with the time so i think i love where this is going i think it gives a lot of empowerment to people to express themselves which is great but i think at the same time people are seeking the right data points to make their opinion and i feel that as a journalist my job is to give them all the right data points all the right context and then tell them that hey go for it you tell me what you think it could be either way you know your comment of let people form their opinion is like a breath of fresh air in current world of journalism wherever was trying to say this is how you must think you better look at it well thats fantastic my other question to you is that the mode in which news is being now disseminated has changed dramatically to personal devices and there are so many other formats im still you know from the dinosaur age of reading my two newspapers every morning what is a small personal device is doing to news now thats a hard one even for me i think its evolving so i think it changes from you know it changes every years and i think just five years back i would use an app to you know just see you know what the latest headlines are and then i started following and then i sort of got a little bit more specialized that hey you know im more interested in certain kinds of things that i want to track and these are the people that i want to track so let me go wherever they are and whatever platform they are on and hear them out so for some that may be twitter for the others it may be a newsletter for some it may just be like they may be mainstream writers and you know i really respect their opinion and i really respect their reporting about a certain thing and i you know and im actually all over the place as well and i love my newspaper in the morning as wellso i think whats happening is that the number of platforms itself are increasing and people are constantly making a choice of following you know youre narrowing down what works best for them so its hard to i mean sometimes i consume news on instagram and its like i would never have thought that you know ill be reading a forbes graphic on instagram but you know i see there and i feel that this is an interesting way for me to you know consume news in a soft manner so for me and i think that this applies to everyone in a sense that you decide you know how you want to spend your time and you know do it in the most efficient way i think everyone is trying to make different tools for that i never thought podcasts would work for me for example but there are sometimes i get up in the morning and im listening to shane parrish or im listening to the morning brew so so its just that the number of outlets have increased and it gives people the flexibility of deciding how they want to do it and i think ill leave it at that i think thats a great response my next question to you aditi is that you have broken several scoops you know and theyve all done very very well from whatever little i was reading my question to you is that why does negative news sell and positive news seems to get ignored its an interesting one so i have a personal view on that i think that negative news sells because its somewhere people are looking for a little bit of not everybody gets to the media right so the people who get the media there is some sort of an envy that sort of comes in the way that you know this guy made it and you know ive been doing something for xyz number of years im the one behind the scenes causing an impact and xyz and very few people make it to the screen or to the limelight in that matter so i think theres a part of us and its largely behavioral science that would say that you know i want to see all sides of that story i dont want to get carried away because like in life we know that theres always a balance and if you dont see the other side of the balance and you get more and more curious that you know it cant be like this it has to be something different you know im missing out on something or they dont know it they get even a little bit of an outlet and any reader gets a little bit of an outlet to see that what could that other side possibly be theyre curious to understand that and its a sense of a balancing act that they see that hey right you know this company was doing xyz but that was just one part of the story now theyre cutting costs so i was right it was not sustainable so its sort of like a self validation in a way as well so i think its largely behavioral science of how we all justabsolutely you know in fact i was hearing someone speak the other day and said they said you know why do saasbahu serials do so well and the response was that because every human being says that oh if its happening on the screen and if it happens in my house then everything is okay right right youre absolutely right about the behavior part well said so lets move to elevate tell me about what youre doing in elevate so elevate for me is is largely and not just me for me and shradha both right its a mission so weve been part of countless number of talks you know ive done a lot of stuff to you know understand what is the best way to you know help somebody out in times of need and as a journalist sometimes i think that the best you can do is open your network up to people and get them access to exactly what they need for what they want at whatever point in time because you are not the best at everything the best capability today is to connect people to the right person to give the right advice at the right time and that is such a lacking thing in our ecosystem access so i started with it to say that you know one i hate the fact that there are very few women in leadership roles today and its true for startups is true across the board but where can we help we can help with startups we also know that you know women are ambitious and you know they want to get ahead so what is the best possible way to you know help them accelerate their journey to leadership and for everybody is different right for me it may not be so much for me it may be a little bit more on you know how do i think more critically for somebody else it may be you know how do i build my brand a third person it may be that hey im not even enjoying my job i want to do something completely different but how do i find somebody who encourages me to think out of the box and say that you know it is possible for you to become a product manager today from being a data analyst yesterday and i think for elevate what we did was we called in a lot of applications we shortlisted out of those we shortlist just based on you know our capability of you know where we think that we can add value so we narrowed it down to mid level management and on path to a leadership role and we said let me connect you to you know the best leaders in the country men women who will help you get there or who will help you think about you know the right ways to get there and thats what the program is like its a close community its women talking to each other and you know sharing their learnings its them talking to emerging leaders and you know getting perspective from them and it is about them being mapped to one leader and that one leader essentially helps them figure that biggest gap that they think that they have in their skill set and help them move forward so i think thats how it was sort of done and it was you know our first cohort and we were very our aim with it was very very tight that you know even if out of these women if or if are able to you know derive value from it and you know help themselves move forward in the right direction then you know its a job well done like its amazing to you know even see that outcome comewell said so again for my viewers and listeners id love to get your perspective on what are some of the kinds of challenges some of these women leaders face as a part of your first cohort so i think a lot of them were in a state of flux during the pandemic that you know is their career moving in the right direction i saw a lot of them being very apprehensive about you know asking for what they deserve for example or even thinking about the right mental models that if i want to go from a to b what is the right way to go about it what is the right way to think about it im sure there are men who face the same issues for me it was more that how do i get you know some of these women to solve for that you know capability a lot of them were also thinking about you know how do i build a brand for myself like they will see a lot of for example a lot of men do a lot of twitter threads right youll see a very few women do that and very few women investors so there was a woman investor who essentially said that you know im intimidated and i go back to twitter and i see that someone you know half of her experience is actually you know doing that today and shes intimidated to do it because she feels that what will people think about me so a lot of these barriers are there and for example somebody wants to start up so they want you know different kinds of advice so a lot of these different answers and i think each woman had her own different viewpoint on what she wanted from the particular cohort and our job was to just connect them to the right people to you know help them figure out so for example we did one with kunal shah and you know largely people were asking questions around you know how do you evaluate companies how do you evaluate founders and the people who were selected for this select townhall were women who wanted to start up so it gave them access to somebodys point of view or somebody who actually does a lot of very active investments his point of view on what he looks for when hes starting up and some of those answers may not be something that you would see in the media because you know you tend to say all the right things but when you know that there is no media you know there is no hand of a media outlet out there right so you think about it differently and you give very candid advice right so i think that was it i also saw a lot of them interested in a lot of new tech like you know they wanted to understand what are nf ts what is crypto how is it changing the world so it depended on you know the stage at which they were in their career and what they wanted the most going forward but i think it was spread across the board very interesting and is this some kind of structured program that youre planning to have for a lot of women or is it a one off thing that you started and youre still experimenting so the first cohort was largely experimentation we wanted to see how we can do this in a more scalable manner i actually came from the school of thought that this cannot be done in a scalable manner because if you want to understand how to impact somebody at a very deep level you need to get the entire background away and one size does not fit all so thats where i came from slowly we realized that there are some problems that can actually be clubbed together and one person may be able to answer some of these questions for five different domains so for example if youre talking about brand building we got somebody from sequoia to you know be able to you know help with a mental model to how to build your brand and your pr presence so by the end of it i think i realized that a lot of it can be clubbed as town halls and can be clubbed as you know closed door meetings but i think i stillgenuinely believe that you know and by the way none of these women had mentors ever in their life like for them the mentors were at best their bosses and you know theyre not going to teach you the right framework for life theyre going to teach you how to do your job better absolutely absolutely so i think well do this again but it will be in a different way and this time we want to do it in a more scalable way and you know im just so glad that these women gave their time to us to help us even understand you know where to take this forwardi agree i agree aditi ive got time for one more question and this is for the many many viewers and listeners who will listen to and view our conversation what would you say are three lessons you would want our viewers and listeners to take away from your journalistic journey oh thats a tough one i think the biggest lesson that at least i take away from myself every single day as a journalist is to back myself okay and you know i just keep telling myself that you know be confident and back yourself thats personally something that drives me forward and the second thing at least that you know again im just giving all lessons that i have learnt i mean do what youre good at and youre confident about that to be a second at something else for example i was in a venture fund and i was like you know im maybe not the best person to be writing a cheque because i dont have that skill set and what i enjoy is writing and i enjoy journalism and i think people call me crazy when i said you know i want to leave you know cushy job of being a venture capital fund to coming back to journalists which is like so much of a grind but i was like this is what im good at this is what i enjoy and you know thats what my life is supposed to be about what i really inspire to do and motivated to do that so yeah i think those are the two that drive me every dayno these are fantastic absolutely fantastic so aditi based on your advice of backing yourself and do what youre good at thank you so much for speaking to me thank you for talking to me about the cap table and your amazing journey as a journalist and thank you for talking to me about elevate and all the great work youre doing to provide mentorship to a lot

internal negative news buscom c,the employees in front of you can be the toughest audience for yo to deliver negative news it can be painful devastating for them,upbeat music lets dive into internal negative news it happens tell the boss that something went wrong i dont know about youits happened to me you sit down there andyou kind of say well and then you normally you own it one time i had a situation i had something go wrong literally we had this snow emergency and i was the official district snowman and i sat down there was communication with my snow crews and everything else at three oclock at fouroclock and five oclock i sat down and i got reportsfrom my crews saying oh were in good shape well open on time with no problem and so boom lo and behold the whole county shuts down and i just told the superintendentof schools we can open and the whole county youcouldnt get to the school but the parking lots were fine i walked in the office with my tail between my legs and i said boss im sorry this wont happen again and his response itwas the best one ever all right david ill depend on you all of a sudden he knew who i was it never happened again so instead of relying on mycrews next time it snowed i was out there in my car seeing how the roads were atfour oclock in the morning to make a decision by am so id never happened again that was a learningexperience cause sometimes people good people getso caught up in their tasks they cant see the big picture and thats why they hire you thats why you are the supervisor cause youre supposed to be in charge i felt that day youmake the mistake one time and youre entitled to a onetime error so thats the only mistakeive made in my entire career well maybe one or two others confronting an employeeabout poor performance thats bad news announcing declining profits lost contracts harmful losses all those are really difficult deliver them in person i prefer facetoface in a meeting or whatever type of setting you can but make certain they can see you that youre agitated and all the nonverbalcommunication that you can give because keep in mind that up to of communication happens in the nonverbal setting if they dont fullyunderstand the message so it makes certain youhave the opportunity whatever even onlineis better than an email so decide whether the negative information is worth mentioning as you go through leavetrivial noncriminal mistakes and onetime bad behaviors alone but report fraudulent travel claims do all those in the process deliver bad news in person ona regular basis facetoface use an indirect strategy if you know the newswill upset the receiver back up using the active voice even though the active voice is the voice of business sometimes delivering bad news in person you wanna back off because theyre gonnaabsorb it pretty personally especially when youretalking to them facetoface so use that methodology and a process make certain you hadgathered all the information because you may get questions about it prepare and rehearse you really need to prepare and rehearse dont go in and wing it because a lot of peoplethat wing it get shut down so it makes certain youprepare and rehearse sometimes even have apractice audience out there to sit down there andthrow you curve balls youre prepared that you may not hearthose questions happening they may actually be something else but at least your mind is already moving for the possibilitythat things may go wrong when youre talking to an audience explain the past the present and what you think is gonnahappen out of that bad news consider taking a colleague with you just to sit down andprotect your back okay even though you may notbe in any physical threat sometimes that moralsupport of somebody with you in the process is a good thing think about timing sometimes you want to sit down and present it at a certain time of day or during the certainmeeting or after a meeting so it doesnt become themain subject of the meeting be patient with the reaction if theres gonna be bad news youre gonna have a big revenue drop you wanna sit down andanticipate a reaction and sometimes people aregoing to sit down there and want to just vent and you may be thesubject of their venting sometimes you end up beinga verbal punching bag or some way they get angrybecause of the fact that they may lose their job you cant blame them forhaving an emotion response dont take abuse but sometimes they needto sit down and talk and talk through things why do people sit down and have change well heres five reasons that are left over hereby gustavo razzetti okay he says really thefear of the uncertain i got a quote here from david mcraney when the brain is facing uncertainty it creates certainty you may sit down and have anexperiment in your office sit down and go through and have a desk a brand new desk broughtin and just put there and see what kind of stories happen ive done that not intentionally i put a brand new desk in we expected to hire somebody the person never gotapproved or anything else so the desk sat there people started makingup all kinds of stories whoa is that persongonna be internal auditor are theyre gonna do this they made up an entirefabrication of gossip based upon a desk being placed there and they were shocked when i took it away what happened we knew an auditor was coming huh an auditor for what so sometimes people make things up if you dont tell them they make it up part of your job as a leader is to make certain theyknow whats going on and dont fear the uncertain fear of failure nobody wants to fail we all wanna sit down and have success society reveals that experience is the name thatwe give to our mistakes sometimes you sit downand you make a mistake and instead of sittingon getting on somebody you may sit down and say you know what i appreciate you going out over here we have a problem so were going to solve the problem but that said you did go outand do something innovative it didnt work this time were gonna make this thing work fear of losing our position over time everybody hasa certain pecking order so to speak in the processthat ive earned this position over here in olson a new person comes in theres a big change they lose they have to have a wider span of control all of a sudden theyre fearfulof losing their position sometimes they may have expert power in the process and they lose expert power because the computer takesover some of their functions or somebody else thefunctions are transferred theyll lose your position and we fear change because were relegated to a different role theyre not in a drivers seat if youre gonna sit down and move them and change your position make certain thats done with dignity and respect in the process fear of inadequacy if you hesitate youremost probably fail make certain that sometimeswere a perfectionist or we compare ourselves to other the grass is always greener so when you fear changetheres also this company fear of inadequacy that you or the person that youre sending out changing their positionor whatever they may be at an adequate for thejob or fear of extra work they have a pace they have a rhythm boom boom you go through life and its a normal thing every single day and all of a sudden one daythe whole world got changed because the water cooler got moved or you had your cheese moved from this side over tothis side over here the experience of livingrequires a lot of hard work but also a lot of changea lot of frustration to process its part of beinghuman especially in this age and this generation as they go through when you announce bad news to employees youll have low morale youll have managers explainthe minimum organization style the story honestly and properly youll haveorganizations in crisis usually communicate the news openly one time i had a job andthat was a short term job i was supposed to comein as an hr consultant and i had to sit down and talk to people theyre considering creating a union but we had a severe economic thing so they hired me on a temporary basis i went in talk to people and my job was to sit there and meeting after meeting aftermeeting to have people that to hear frustrationsthey sit down and say this is what administrationmanagement wants over here okay and then i wouldtake their messages back to management and we wouldhave dialogue and the employees they were justified in their concerns because good communication didnt happen i was a communicationconsultant to assist them sometimes you need to sit down and back off from your official positionand go listen to people its a big thing its a big step when bad news is delivered you want to make certainyou deliver it personally weve talked about that but too often its easier to send it by email cause you dont haveanybody looking at you glaring at you or angry with you theyre angry at your computer except youre on theother side of that email sometimes you have differentchannels personal channels sometimes we have a meetingto talk about this over here or they missed the meeting mixed up with thosethat missed the meeting they have the communication you may have to sit down anddo a video and sent it out or you may have to sitdown and text or email buffer start with a neutral orpositive message statement about the transition give the reasons and then announce the badnews and then have a closing it sure sounds like a memo sandwich positive negative positive oh yeah weve talked about that make certain you do thatespecially here on bad news to employees as a group a couple of closing thoughts a negative announcement can be delivered in a caring fashion its not always easy because youre going tohave a reaction because for every action theresan equal opposite reaction and sometimes when its delivered people take it emotionally and the other whole matrixthat theyve set up in life has totally changed always treat people withindignity and respect it goes a long ways earning the respect from others keep in mind the five types of fears that goes past this setting it goes into real life this is real message becausethis is about real people and thats how we think and how we act even tough messages can be discussed without condemnation and tell them before the grapevine does be that authority figure with that take care,0.0

satisfied patientsare very reluctant when it comes to writing reviews about you online and at the same timethe angry and dissatisfied patients are very vocal about you online so now that we know what are the four causesbehind angry patients reviews infection lets understand one by one what can be thecure for all these causes so talking about cause no that is when there sa person who s doing it deliberately because of personal content or theres a competitorwho s trying to soil your reputation then in that case you are stuck in a verytricky situation this is because you cannot go very directabout it and you cannot simply go and respond to their reviews saying that this is a fakereview because obviously you have to provide a proof an evidence to your audiences to yourprospective patients that this is actually a fake review so how would you do that so a very smart way of dealing with thissituation would be that you can go to each of those reviews coming from the fake sourcesone by one and you can you know ask that could you please give me the details aboutwhich incident you are talking or which location you are talking about or which provider areyou talking about or could you please provide us some details of the timings when you visitedour medical practice so that we can offer to resolve your issues so if those are fake reviews then obviouslythey won t have the details to provide and probably they ll be intimidated and they llremove their reviews on their own so this is how you can deal with the situationbut then if they re going over the top to soil your reputation and they are postinga lot of negative reviews about you on social media and on these sites you know medical directories and they realso trolling you on social media so in that case its always advisable to file a caseof cyber defamation apart from this you ll also have to gofor a press release to let your prospects know that all these negative reviews thatare floating about you online are fake and they could be misguiding so now coming to dealing with cause no whichis that there s actually a problem area in your clinic or hospital that needs to befixed so in that case you have to go through eachand every review that s coming from your patients and you have to identify if thereare some common issues or some common problem areas that every patient is pointing out so if that is the case then definitely there ssomething that needs your attention and needs to be fixed so in this case also it is very importantto respond to each and every review and to let them know that you are working on improvingon those problem areas so coming to the third cause which is thatthere has actually been a mishap while performing a medical procedure then that is a very trickysituation and you need to take care of it very carefully so because we are talking about a clinic ora hospital and we are dealing with a locality here so any such news would spread like aforest fire and everybody in the locality would be soapprehensive about your clinic or medical facility that they would never want to visityour location and obviously there would be other you know online news magazines thatwould be talking about you negatively and the news will obviously be all over the placeeven when it comes to google searches so in this case what you need to do is youneed to prepare case studies and you have to post them online and in these case studiesyou have to explain that how did you take care of the situation in order to make itbetter and how did you compensate for it and how did you make sure that this or any suchincident is not going to repeat in future so these case studies are going to help yougain the confidence of the prospects back and even of the existing patients obviously the second thing that you would need to dois online reputation repair and that would be done by fetching more and more positivereviews about you so once you ve created these case studiesand you ve posted them online and you ve regained the confidence of your prospectsand you have patients walking into your clinic so the very focus should be on getting thehappy and satisfied patients like more and more happy and satisfied patients to reviewyou online because obviously you cannot be deleting those negative reviews about youyou cannot be deleting those negative news that s floating online about you so sure what you can do is you can just pushthem down in the searches and you can get the positive reviews and the positive articlesappear right on the top so this is how you deal with the situationif you are bitten by cause no now coming to the most important and mostprevalent cause which is that your happy and satisfied patient base is very reluctant aboutposting reviews online so this happens because obviously the negativepatients are very vocal online and the happy and satisfied one s have been treated wellso they don t really care they don t really want to go online and write anything so if this is the situation then your prospectsare getting to see an incomplete picture of how actually your services are because they reonly going to see the perspective of your dissatisfied patients and the perspective of your satisfied patientstotally goes missing from your online reviews so in that case there s a need to promptyour happy and satisfied patients to review you and that prompting has to be done with a trickjust so that they don t feel annoyed about being bugged with these survey being donefrom our side so there s a solution that we provide atrepugen for this particular situation in order to know how repugen can help you deal withthe situation you can schedule for a live demo so once you get your happy patients to reviewyou online you

positive patients reviewingyou online you can give the real picture of your patient satisfaction level to the prospectswho are looking for you online going by the stats for maximum healthcareunits and also for the providers the patient satisfaction level in reality is very verydifferent from the patient satisfaction level that is reflected online the sheer reason behind this is that the happyand

steam gamers sued for negative comments the know game news,you guys thought key activation reviews not counting towards a games score on steam was bad try getting sued for leaving,welcome to the know im ashley jenkins and im jon risinger thinking about leaving bad comments on steam about a game you hateall the time yeah well you better watch out because one developer is tired of your shit and theyre fighting back truly the hero we deserve this developer isnt just fighting back across the internet with angry comments however notheyre taking the battle to court and have just filed a lawsuit against gamers on steam over negative comments made about their company yeah so you gotta watch out about those comments now apparently this is of course a total headscratcher although once you learn the identity of the developer in question it should not be too shocking the suehappy game company is none other than digital homicide yes thats the same duo that caused a stir by suing game critic jim sterling im sorry jimfuckingsterling son earlier this year for saying bad things about their games the new lawsuit against gamers was reported on by youtuber sidalpha who got wind of the lawsuit from a comment someone left on one of his videos he was also kind enough to provide the actual documents via google drive so people like us could laugh at the hilaritywhich weve been doing all morning this is stupid filed in a district court of arizona the latest lawsuit filed by digital homicide cofounders the romine brothers is a personal injury lawsuit titled romine vs unknown party thats the internet the internet is the unknown party its asking for million in damages according to website mmo fallout who has been following the saga of digital homicides scorched earth antics for the last year or so best part of the lawsuit is that since the romines dont know the names of any of the defendants they list out their steam names in official court documents so were not going to go over all the names listed but burgerxtremes gotta be on therepretty much theres something really delightful about the fact that all these documents are calling out individuals like demonsword michoo jones jdudehaeisback toon vlux karl pilkington you name it its just like all the fact names that the internet can come up with how many names involving vape i wanna know i gotta know how many vape names are in a court document right now hopefully not a lot for some reason romine didnt feel like listing out anything past the first dozen names adding jane john does through whatyeah they just listed them out as like numbers jane and john does through so theres like a jane doe they couldnt even be bothered listing out all the people theyre suing laughing thats stupiddo the work bro youre gonna do this lawsuit list em all out no i think that was very thorough they counted them the attached documents include a number of derogatory comments from the named steam users no kiddingit seems the big sticking point that digital homicide is concerned about in particular so concerned about theyre taking it to court is the accusation from multiple users that they are simply reskinning the same couple of games and then rereleasing them were not going to comment on whether or not thats what theyre actually doing but a quick glancewell do we want be jane doe like im okay with being petty but a quick glance at their game library shows that they do release a lot of games rather close together with many appearing quite similar they released three separate games in the month of april thats three in one month for instance and two of them are d space shooters just one of them is styled like space invaders and one is a sidescroller so its like they took the game and rotated it at degreesjust yeah they also got a bunch of their games pegged by steams greenlight program for doing essentially the same thing a few months ago in total games that they were doing got hit with an incompatible tag by steam of them were released on the same day laughing that seems a little excessive reskinning the same games is any developers prerogative but the thing that posters named in the lawsuit are accusing digital homicide of goes a little bit further some of these new games come with steam trading cards which is enough for some collectors out there to make cheap purchases so they can keep the cards or sell them on steams marketplace i mean i get it cards are kinda fun but who buys a game just for the cards idiotsany developer who created steam cards gets a cut of the transactions whenever the cards are sold in addition to the purchase of the game obviously so these commenters are basically accusing digital homicide of not only spamming steam with multiple cheap games to make a quick buck but also an attempt to make money by getting as many steam cards available as possible in the market and getting those in the marketplace where theyre sold and theyre worth pennies guys pennies sounds like a weirdass business modelyeah yeahyeah a weirdass thing for commenters to care about and a weirdass thing for a developer to bring to light by suing somebody you dont need to bring this to light be hushhush about itjust please leave this one under the rug keep your shame to yourself and if youre worried that the romines totally justified lawsuit is going to slip through the cracks on a petty legal technicality like not knowing the names of their defendants well the romines have already thought of that one because they have also officially subpoenaed valve to try to get the idendidies dentities of the hundred or so users and their identities as welltheir identities as well yeahso many so many things getting valve involved in a lawsuit against gamers when youve already had some shady business practices uhm yeah thats probably going to work out really well for you bro keep at itthe last thing that they probably need is valve taking a closer look at themyeah this whole thing is next level batshit bonkers but again its not too surprising if youre familiar with digital homicide from their previous works like the time they sued youtube critic jim sterling for more than million in damages that was a good time as well just in terms of the headscratching how is thishow do we live in this world headscratching its entertaining yeah people say mean things happens bro that lawsuit was filed by the romines back in march alleging that sterling committed assault libel and slander against their company most of that was due to a series of videos traded between sterling and digital homicide assault wow yes they got assaulted verbally assaultedow that hurts sterling lampooned one of their games slaughtering grounds which prompted digital homicide to do a review of his review yeah that makes sense and then he did a review of their review of his review and then they dmcaed his video look even the tldr of this whole saga is just is that nothing makes sense nothing makes sense on the jim sterling front not much has happened since they first filed their lawsuit against him because these things well i mean its the courts they tend to take a lot of time hes filed a motion to dismiss theyve replied to his motion to dismiss and the cycle of crazy continues did they film a video reviewing his dismissal and then he did a review of their review of ha yes its all in the court documentsits all vlogging their entire court case will be vlogging okay so weve seen game devs going after bad comments before but in the past thats only been when those bad comments come with a platform like a giant youtube audience right and its not even unprecedented for game developers to go after players either but usually its because the gamers created some kind of hack or tool that is ruining the games multiplayer like weve seen with paragon and league of legends just in the last few months for instance but going after fans in court for making bad comments about your studio and your games thats actually unprecedented and probably not something that is going to keep their games on steam for very long especially now that valve is going to be dragged into the process since the subpoena has been approved valve does have to respond to it in at least some official capacity in all likelihood theyll challenge it and they might even ask for their legal fees to be covered because they can probably get away with that because this is crazy valves got to have good lawyersi mean im not a lawyer but id say that this is crazy yeah as for whether or not the suit will go anywhere we doubt it will be able to without the actual identities of these gamers and even then just like sue a random person be like you you im suing you whats your name its like suing a ghost and even then it seems like more of a scaretactic to silence criticism in general on steam at some point you got to wonder if these guys will ever learn their lesson and simply let these kinds of things go or maybe just make good games i kind of hope they dont because every time they pop up its just like a little gift of weird kind of makes you feel good theres people that are stupider than you in the world well it makes everything else feel so normal by comparison yeahby now theyve probably hurt their own business a whole lot more with these kind of tactics than any one bad comment could have caused on its own but sadly there is a lesson that some smaller developers seem to have a hard time learning besides why spend time fixing your video games when you can make millions from ridiculous lawsuits i mean you have to win the lawsuits to make the millions yeah they might be the first people to do something stupid and then suing people for money instead of actually doing real work oh wait notheyre nope thereve been people doing that forever so what do you guys think of digital homicides latest legal antics this time against the gamers themselves not just jim sterling but a hundred of themlet us know in the comments for future updates on insane developers going after steam users like this video and why not just subscribe to the knowbecause we cover that stuff all the time i feel like i almost feel like we need to do an official handoff now like jim sterling its all you you have the floor jimis there any way to make eddie off screen call them digital suicide yeeaaahhoh go with that one eddie digital suicide thats good thats good eddie should have been in the script laughteryou literally write this thing,0.0
is todays news media a positive or negative influence on the world,maria armoudian journalist and author of kill the messenger the medias role in the fate of the world joins us to talk about,david pakman maria armoudian is with us shes a journalist educator and also theauthor of kill the messenger the medias role in the fate of the world and its a fascinating book and i hadit was great to meet you in kansas city maria at the grassroots radio conference maria armoudian yes david and really a lot of important questionsaddressed in the book asked and addressed in your book and at the conference and before we get into dissecting the variouspieces of where the media landscape has gone over the last years do you think thatnews media has on the whole gone in a positive direction for the fate of the world as youput it in your book or has it been a detractor something actually holding back progress armoudian well you know its tough to sayits just one or the other because its such a mixed bag particularly with the internet so one of the things that goes on with theinternet is that its allowed ordinary people and citizen journalists and people with reallyimportant commitment to have access without being filtered through traditional gatekeepers and weve seen a lot of very positive developmentswith that international ngos human rights organizationsenvironmental organizations you see them being able to connect up and connect withpeople directly but at the same time were seeing that thatsalso true of people that dont have such positive interests and intent so for example we see extremist groups thatare taking their messages and disseminating them also through the internet and throughblogs and often they are very inaccurate types ofinformation they are hateful messages what i call blame sayings where they will blamea particular group for sociopolitical problems that that group did not create all by themselves david i mean i think one of the biggestequalizers for my side has been the internet and social media i mean particularly forour show we saw that when we were just kind of a syndicatedradioonly show on about radio stations versus now that we have you know a strongweb presence were doing video were on free speech tv because of connections madethrough the internet all of these things really have been a resultof connections that we would not have been able to make if it depended on being in newyork or la and seeing the people that decide about who gets on directtv for example at the same time i think that the line hasbeen blurred between like you said grassroots and astroturf in many cases because itsvery easy for corporations with resources to use some of these more grassroots meanslike social media for example or the internet and hide what is actually a basic corporateagenda that can be hard to discern can it not armoudian absolutely im going to give you a couple of examplesone which is an astroturf example theres a video that has been placed ontothe internet and then disseminated to a lot of libraries called greening the earth this is very specifically astroturf kind ofor is it astro i always get these mixed up but this is the idea is that they are fabricatinginformation about climate change and able to just post it up on the internet claimingthat you know warming is good for the earth carbon more carbon dioxide is good for plant life and they make a psuedoscientific argumentabout it but its completely wrong and no scientist would ever buy that but peoplewho dont have a science background would buy that now at the same time thats on the kindof corporate level that you were talking about but there are other really more direct damagingthings too so for example we saw in norway anders breivikwhen he picked up the gun and went and shot up all the people in the labor party at theyouth camp well he was getting all of his messages also from the internet david sure we saw that also with byron williamsand the glenn beck situation where he said you know i got the idea that the tides foundationwas bad from watching glenn beck to go back to the carbon dioxide examplei actually recently at a talk radio conference i dont know how it happened but one of thesponsors of the conference was actually a group that was i dont know that it was the one you mentionedbut it was they basically in exchange for sponsorship they were allowed to haveone of their socalled experts do a presentation about how great carbon dioxide is and i actually do think that most of the peoplein that room knew that it was a corporate ruse i dont know that people in that room werereally falling for it but the idea that these socalled experts the expert and that rolein media is something that is kind of a can of worms on its own and what exactly is anexpert who are we going to for expertise in manyon many media outlets armoudian right absolutely we saw in the issue of climate which isthe last case study that i did in kill the messenger that there are so many outletsthat were putting real climate research scientists against people who were not research scientistswho may have been either on the payroll of fossil fuel companies or working for thinktanks that were sponsored by a lot of fossil fuel industries and making it seem to theiraudience that they were you know equals that they were peers when there was no sucha relationship like that but thats a little that is something thathas developed over the last you know probably years whereas historically i think wehave seen a little bit more time devoted a little bit more factchecking in the traditionaljournalism world part of that i think is just that the hournews cycle has not really allowed for journalists to be as thorough as they want to be and there are a lot of other factors toobut thats definitely problematic id like to go back if we can for a secondabout something you mentioned about how the internet has helped your show and has alsohelped a lot of these oppressed people all over the world with cell phone cameras andwith other means to be able to photograph and take evidence and communicate with peoplethroughout the international community about what they are facing burma we saw that for example with i dontknow if you saw the film called burma vj these democracy activists were just givensmalltechnology cameras that they could videotape how the government was oppressing democraticefforts then in iran during the green movement wesaw a similar activity where people were able to document what was going on and then justupload it by internet by satellite david well its interesting you mentionthe iran example because i have that in my notes and the reason i wanted to bring upthat example is that thats an interesting situation to me because it was a positiveinfluence access to some of this technology internetwas clearly positive but also it led to punishment and mistreatment of those caughtusing some of these technologies so where how do we synthesize that in other words clearly the aggregate wasa positive in the aggregate this was a positive however it led to new reasons why peoplecould be oppressed and further singled out and punished too armoudian right were actually seeing some of that also nowin egypt because after the egyptian revolution now protesters are getting punished by thenew government and especially when theyre trying to communicate in this way you know this is i think these are things that are going totake some time for scholars to sort of parse out what exactly is occurring but the otherpiece is that media like you and other you know media that are on broadcast and cableand these kinds of networks really need to kind of get in there and support the abilityfor people to get real information thats the only way and historically if you look back far enoughand i go all the way back in this book to like as much as i could to show howit was traditional media that helped to transform situation after situation whether they werehuman rights abusive situations in south africa democratization there taiwan mexico senegalchile chile kind of was both sides helped bring peace agreements in northern irelandand burundi in burundi it was radio that helped peoplecome together and stop killing each other in northern ireland it was print radio andtelevision before we ever had this ability and this access to this kind of information so i think today its going to be inaudible i think al jazeera in the middle east hasbeen very useful in helping to disseminate narratives that are helping middle easternersto think through these things themselves david they absolutely are and that actuallythats a whole other conversation well have to have about al jazeera because i dontsee it as all positive i see some concerns with al jazeera and i wish we had more time i want to have you back and actually addresswhat can real media reform activists do to really create a more positive independentmedia situation in the future but it will have to wait maria armoudian the book is kill the messengerthe medias role in the fate of the world thanks so much

how to deal with negative reviews tips amp tricks news dish by metro,welcome to dish support if you are working in a gastronomy business you are on the right channel with us did your restaurant,hi im jordan and today ill show you how to best deal with negative reviews how to deal with negative reviews it might sound strange but a negative review can actually mean something good for your business lets put ourselves in the shoes of a customer who is reading reviews wouldnt you be a bit skeptical if there were only five star applications consistently perfect online reviews seem too good to be true and one wonders how many of these reviews are actually real this helps to take the whole thing a little more positively but of course you have to take care of it now to leave a good impression despite the negative rating to show that you care about customer feedback you can write a thoughtful and honest response that makes you and your company more approachable this not only helps you to improve your position visàvis the customer who wrote the negative review but also to convince potential new customers of you if they stumble upon a sympathetic answer from you but how do you deal with negative reviews in detail avoiding the problems works in very few cases and in this case certainly not the rating will definitely not go away from this its getting worse because the longer a negative review remains unanswered the higher the chance that a potential customer is pissed off by this review conversely you shouldnt act too hastily and respond with the anger or annoyance that you feel from the evaluation because you dont want to make it worse or make it work for potential customers in such a way that you want to mess with your customers there are easy steps you can follow if you received a negative review step take a short break and keep your fingers off your laptop or cell phone this helps to distance oneself from the situation step after you have calmed down and are ready to look at the evaluation objectively clarify the following questions when did the customer contact your business which employee did the guest interact with is the complaint actually in an area where you can improve your business step once youve made sure that the negative review really came from a dissatisfied customer you can start replying if this is not the case you should take care to report this falsely created rating to the platform the various platforms such as google tripadvisor or yelp have different approaches to this deal with them and report the wrong review in principle you can follow four simple steps when composing a response to a negative comment step write a personal answer address the customer by name in most cases you will find at least the first name in the review in this way you prevent you from appearing numb and show that you are actually dealing with the assessment step say thank you thank you even if it is difficult for you the customer will perceive you as someone who is open to feedback and criticism here are a few formulations how you can phrase your thank you thank you for bringing this to our attention thanks for letting us know thank you for giving us an honest review of your experience step apologize and offer a solution in most cases you are not to blame for what the customer experienced but most people dont trust companies that are too ignorant and proud to admit their mistakes therefore i have a couple of phrases to say sorry even if it is not your own fault im sorry that you feel im sorry you had this experience at insert company name here im sorry that you werent satisfied with but dont forget to come up with a solution to the problem after you apologize be it an explanation of a wrong communication that led to it or a replacement for a wrongly executed order try to offer a solution that the customer the negative review can accept step offer to clarify the problem offline to emphasize even more that not some automated program is responding to the rating offer to discuss the problem further offline in order to find a satisfactory solution you can formulate it as follows for example you are welcome to contact me personally by email or phone if you would like to discuss this problem in detail just make sure that you also include your name ie at least your first name and initials your title and your contact information always keep the goal of the matter in mind make sure the customer feels heard about their review show the public that you care about customer feedback help solve a problem that a customer had while interacting with your store finally i have one more rule that you should definitely follow when it comes to negative reviews from your customers never ask a customer to remove their negative review asking a customer to do so is rarely received positively and tends to lead to further negative reviews remember that a few negative reviews dont mean doom just make sure to respond quickly and professionally again what is appropriate is to ask customers to leave a review when they are satisfied this way you collect more and more positive reviews and the negatives get less and less attention these were our tips and tricks this week would you like to stay up to date on topics in your industry visit our blog at dishcoblog we look forward to your feedback on our video be it a

angry rant wtf at the loot crates in battlefront,angryjoe rants on the extremely awful loot crates and multiplayer progression in the star wars battlefront beta and worries,angry joe i have been playing the star wars battlefront uh beta here and testing out the various things thats in the game the two big things that i was looking for in this beta as opposed to having played the alpha is how are how is this new loot system going to work and how is progression going to work now that i have it in my house and not at an event first i want to start with how much i enjoy the gameplay this is fantastic it is so much fun i really like the strike i really like the galactic battles and shit the space combat is awesome now im not in atmospheric i cant drive worth shit but in space over time ive learned to to control and i feel the controls have improved it feels like you know a new developer took in fact i think a new developer took it over i think its like criterion that did the space combat and dice that did you know the ground combat so i can say and be happy to report that once you get used to it its incredibly fun you you feel like a badass because theres lots of bots in there and this is part of the reason why the original battlefront was fun you just tear through bots and then you run it to players and it becomes this oneonone thing and its just great i love space battles however there are two big things in the game right now that are really worrying me for its release in november and i wouldnt be doing my job if i didnt try to inform you guys that number one are these fucking loot crates what has essentially happened here it you know when they said that all dlc is gonna be free and theres no more season pass and youre gonna get free maps and were not gonna split the player base and you know and i was like oh my god i fucking gonna place my preorder for the first time i might actually preorder something but there was a catch the catch is what youre staring at right here the lootcrate system and im telling you guys this lootcrate system is exactly the type of system that you would find in a freetoplay game that you would pay zero dollars for i dont know the exact price theyre gonna charge for each one of these crates when it comes out but i have a sneaking suspicion is gonna be a or if they think their shit is that awesome and im telling you the shit that you get from the crates is awful its boring its shitty its as if they tried to copy overwatch and did it lazily boba fett death from above boba fett takes less damage when using his rocket barrage so maybe it literally is rng and you just have to go jacob it it is ive got golds at level one angry joe okay well and thats thats gonna be the addictive element the gambling element for people uh so all of these are meaningless until you get gold and somebody with more money than you will have gold alright we were a team if you have more money oj laughter if you dont then youre gonna die eight zero that we you get the mvp select victory pose rage intensifies nein nein nein nein what you roll is what you get okay and that sucks because youre gonna want to keep getting crates and youre gonna want to roll over and over until you get the golds all the way up here until you get the the best fucking star cards until then all the star cards are garbage and what is going to entice you to do that is buying fucking star cards and heres how you play normally crafting parts sometimes youre gonna get twenty i think you can even get ten but its not always guaranteed that youre gonna get the twenty however this is the only way to progress in the game jacob so in that rant yesterday too i had played like five and a half hours and in five and a half hours i got a hundred and ten scrap it wasnt even like it was id have to play six times more to get a scrap gun so i would have had to play for thirty hours to get a single gun angry joe okay its not like whereas call of duty you have guns or whatever and as you play you unlock guns and you play more and you unlock more guns here you play more to unlock currency and the currency does nothing towards on progressing and unlocking anything your progression means jack shit and thats another problem that im gonna show you here in a bit it doesnt matter whether you get one kill or fifty kills you get the same amount of credits there is no incentive to do better or worse than the leader of the game or the shittiest person in the game youre gonna get about the same credits that is fucked up del wow guys other joe they all got first second and third angry joe alright this is going to be funny right tell me many credits did you all earn this match del angry joe i got laughter i literally did nothing and del did everything and he got del i was times better than the secondhighest person on our team del uh how many credits did you get angry joe oh my god it show me kills two fucking kills other joe watch out del all right i got how many credits did you get though angry joe i got how many did you get del other joe how many kills did you get with the officer del angry joe i got two kills i got boi boy thats how its done ive got more kills than dale right now but you know what it doesnt matter cause hes gonna get the same points as me del i was afk what gun fire grunts angry joe how did that happen del i did it other joe check what you got hurry angry joe but by then strikebomb other joe god dale cant you get or angry joe yeah but i stopped i lost my groove del angry joe i got which means i beat you nah i got how much damage did you do del angry joe that is wrong that is sh awful awful and then what do you get you get credits what are these credits do they buy loot boxes ok for free you buy loot boxes or you can spend what or to buy loot boxes so progression is now loot boxes the progression in battlefront ll a game is now a copy of a mobile freetoplay game where you will had paid zero dollars uses the exact same tactics using the exact same thing however only really fucking poorly and ill show you some more examples of what you get from these cards that posture though laughs sarcastically admit it that these are some sick epic poses joe but you cannot deny itother joe should just have one lying on the floor angry joe i cant wait to see the people defending this fucking dog man did you see that sick epic pose i just got other joe which one did you get oh thats a good one hey angry joe oh i got the same one you got other joe thats a good one laughs angry joe but hey wait its a sick epic pose its great posture other joe oh yeahangry joe did you have to get a tempurpedic other joe my is kinda slouched angry joe you got the slouched variation joe thats fucking ultra rare man can we trade other joe sweet yes angry joe ok lets trade del trading is scrap angry joe oh fuck del yeah sorry other joe shit overlapping speech del oh by the way that trading thing was a joke chat angry joe upgrading the your star cards del but you can only upgrade star cards with scrap but youre also getting rng on your scrap rolls so pretty much everything is just gonna be rng for you youre not actually gonna ever be able to really pick what you want its just if you get lucky it makes me sick to talk about this angry joe it makes me sick too wow wow anyways back to this so since credits do nothing for you than buy loot boxes how do you actually get guns you have to get crafting material okay well how much do you actually need to fucking unlock shit well lets go look at that lets go to our collection lets say i like heavy heavy is your best class right well here in the beta theres only two weapons i hope to god thats not the could you imagine if there was only two guns in the final game for each class im going to assume that that is not true and there are way more weapons in the game lets say uh there are so many weapons in the star wars universe and so dont give me that fucking crap so theres gonna be more than two if there isnt rage grunts anyway you start off with the first gun which is peculiar that theres no attachments for it so that leads me to believe that the beta is different from the final game because the second gun you get attachments see all these attachments why dontwhy doesnt the first gun have attachments right because thats more progression that you can do okay so lets assume that this is the way you do it right and well lets go to a class where i dont have the secondary weapon were gonna go to assault okay dont have this one how much does it get to cost to get the second weapon one of two weapons crafting material and remember the only way to get the crafting material is randomly in loot crates so of course some people are just gonna buy until they get all the fucking guns in the game and do whatever the hell they want with all the best star cards because its gonna take them forever to craft that and then each one of these fucking uh attachments cost ingamecurrency so its so uh were thinking per class crafting materials per class and thats only if theres two weapons right now bear with me on this okay were gonna pull up our fucking calculator lets lets just say that theres three guns per class in the final version that you unlock you start with one and you unlock three so three times four classes youve got fucking guns to unlock in the final version which would be oh my god anyway so times credits for each of those guns youre youre looking at crafting material to basically get all the guns in the game three guns per class thats how much you have to have and the only way to get that is to go through those loot crates right so those loot crates youre gonna get to crafting materials if you get anything so lets just average it out to you get crafting materials per every time you get one of those loot crates okay and itll take you crate box openings to get that so this is blowing my mind i dont know if this is gonna be in the final game i i am this is why im warning you now because i am shocked at this and this is only guns in the game right its gonna take you so long to do that times because based upon how ive been playing and how dels been playing it doesnt matter if youre good or bad its gonna take you the same amount of time to do because as weve seen you get the same amount of credits whether youre good or bad and its taking him like five hours to earn one or two fucking crates five hours times thats how many hours its gonna take to unlock all the guns in the game that cant be right i have no idea whats going on you guys do the math for me in the fucking comments because im looking at this shit and im s and im even giving the game the benefit of the doubt and what im seeing here is completely fucked for the loot crates okay not only is it a unbearable grind but it is theres not enough guns and it takes you forever and the stuff that you get from the crates suck but its not oh its not like overwatch where overwatch does the same thing but theres actually i dont know theres theres shit there that you actually care about different skins but theres no fucking customization in this game because fucking probably lucasarts doesnt want people to fuck with or customise this at all so basically what im trying to tell you in summary is the loot crate system is disgusting it has me worried is this the tradeoff that were gonna have in the future if this game does this and it goes over well are all of our games gonna now use the freetoplay model and then just charge us because this is the lowest effort ive ever seen put into a loot crate system and expect people to buy it and really youre gonna have to buy it because its paytowin cos theres gonna be a clear advantage to some of these cards i mean its theres theres no way around it youre gonna have a clear advantage especially like you know lets look at the fucking death from above is probably the best fucking example damage reduction when youre flying with the fucking jet pack damage reduction youre gonna want this one so what are you gonna do when you get this shitty one youre gonna upgrade for and then youre gonna upgrade for then youre gonna upgrade for then youre gonna upgrade for its because you cant fucking get it in the fucking crate normally after five hours hours hours hours hours hours youre gonna get frustrated trying to roll the death from above fucking cards so youre gonna pay fucking money to fuckin guarantee that youre gonna get it youre gonna pay fucking up to fucking times trying to get the fucking death from above card because the fucking guy has it and he kills you every fucking time with and every time he has it he gets to be boba fett for the entire match and when youre boba fett and you only have reduction you cant hold on to boba fett you die immediately when you have him because you dont have damage reduction its paytowin paytowin in our multiplayer game its no no no im so fucking worried about it so so i they dont really change stuff from betas ive not known one ea game that changed their stuff radically from the beta to launch betas these days you know theyre not betas you know so so what i think here is were headed towards an asteroid in and you they theyve done it theyve combined a really good game with a really shitty paytowin loot box system that is the next step in our battle against overbearing microtransactions and the theyre about to win because its just gonna slide right under the fact that its good game and nobodys gonna talk about it and were gonna lose the battle in and all of our triple a games are gonna be like this going forward its dangerous shadow of war putting that shit in forza putting that shit in the loot crate now star wars battlefront putting that shit in weve seen battle crate packs in battlefield and call of duty its were losing i dont know what to do about it i dont know what to do this sucks

angry rant the instagram scam nobody talks about,i wanted to help give back to aviation by doing a give away this week but some people who do nothing but take from our aviation,do something in aviation take the photosand videos yourself post it and stop stealing from everybody my guess isyoure too lazy to go do that youre participating in a scam on instagram andyou probably dont even know it and you know its something ive known for awhile but something happened last week that pushed me over the edge now if ihad seconds in an elevator with mark zuckerberg i could explain to him whyhis companys losing millions of dollars because of these parasites but i haveintended opportunity yet this game applies to anybody it can be an aviationflight attendants cabin crew applies to cars applies the models applies toreally any niche topic but specifically since i know aviation im gonna betalking about that now if you dont know who i am my name is kelsey i fly a and my channel for gear is all about aviation first im gonna explain to youhow the scam works and then and what i explain to you why you should care andwhat you can do about it heres several large instagram pages now what you mightnotice is they have a lot of followers but you also notice a majority thatcontent isnt even theirs without getting deep and how instagram works ifsomeone is posting two or three photos or videos every day and youre likingthose photos instagram is seeing that and saying wow this must be very coolcontent so im gonna share this instagram page to other people who likethis topic and thats how these instagram pages grow so quickly so thatmay be how you found my instagram page you may have liked it on their aviationpicture and then instagram said oh well if you like that you may like this andthen you find mine so take that basic concept and put it on steroids andthats basically what these scammers are doing during my two weeks of flyingaround the world im able to usually grab enough photos or videos to be ableto post two or maybe three times a week throughout the month including on mydays off when im not flying however these parasites that are sittingat home every day all theyre doing is stealing without asking for permissioncontent from me other crew members pilots flight attendants and whoeverthey want stealing it without permission and then sharing it and then creditingit and thinking that thats an acceptable way to give credit to thepeople thats not how it works and because theyre able to share two orthree times a day instagram is more likely to recommend that page becausetheyre saying oh wow this person is putting out a lot of content it doesntreally realize that its all stolen information noware some pages out there that will ask for permission before we sharing andobviously that is a totally different scenario or if you have a page wherepeople are sending you stuff asking you to share it thats another differentscenario but thats not whats happening and a lot of the cases which i showedyou earlier and im not even talking about the people who have stolen myphotos and tried to use my image to grow an instagram account let me tell youusing my photos dez is not going to get you anywhere on instagram trust meso step one of the scam is steal a bunch of crew members photos flight crew andcabin crew steal it all put it all together and start pushing out contenttwo to three times a day now that thats done you go to step two of the scam nowthese scammers have hundreds of thousands of followers everything thatthey push out onto their instagram get to push to you and youre more likely tosee it so now that they have that channel what they do is try to sell youstupid bracelets or lamps or tshirts that you have no interest in buying orif theyre big enough theyll sell that account change the name and give it tosomebody else so they can sell you a different service or product in thatniche heres a great example a flight attendant ginny recorded this videohowever on her instagram it got three thousand views but the flight schoolthat stole this video got a hundred and twenty thousand views now they didntbuild this account up by stealing photos they built it because they bought itfrom another account that was stealing photos which im gonna get to in asecond did they credit her yeah they did but these lazy bitches who were stealingtheir video are propelling their instagram growth a lot faster because ofthe size and the volume of their account which again they bought if they hadntstolen her video then theres more likely have a chance for other people tosee it and share it and had grow her personal instagram page which isobviously what most people are trying to do in this flight school didnt evenmake this account they bought it from another account that was stealing videosand pictures from other flight crew members and cabin crew members i meanhow lazy can you be youre a flight school take photos and videos of yourflight school the services that you deliver instead of stealing from flightcrew and cabin crew and posting the photos up to grow your instagram profilewith just crediting them would i be able to send my friends to your flight schooland then on their license i just credit your flight school for you teaching themhow to fly no that wouldnt be how it worked now i realize thats kind of anextreme example but its the same concept youre not asking for permissionto take theyre content youre just taking itand then sharing it and hopefully the pricing the way you treat your studentsis in the same way of taking as much as you can and giving as little as you cannow heres why you should care but sides affected these cockroaches theyrestealing other peoples information and making money off of other peoples hardwork theres something that really pushed me over the edge last week acouple weeks ago i was speaking to a friend of mine hes an airline pilot andtheres a lot of airline pilots that are sitting at home right now they cantwork because kovat is in full blast and i was talking with him and i had theidea of making a video to give away a couple thousand dollars to guys to makea flight sim video because of kovan i cant go home and i thought this wouldbe a cool way if people send in a video and ill pick some winners ill let youall vote for it now that ive actually recorded that video and its done i wasgonna post it on sunday but because of everything thats going on had been soirritated about this that i just couldnt post that right away imposting this video first i posted that video on my youtube for about three daysand got hundreds of emails from people showing me video clips of them playing aflight sim then i put it on my instagram and i reached out to a lot of instagrampages and i said hey listen theres a lot of pilots that arent working rightnow were trying to do something to give back to the aviation community can youplease share this story that im trying to do to promote people to do stuff athome with aviation so that way they can stay at home and maybe make some moneywhen i reached out to all these pages that loved aviationthe response was either they read it or ignored it or they wanted money from mein order to promote me giving money away now there were several instagram pagesthat shared that story which was very cool and i talked about it in the videothat will come out next week however there were a lot more that ignored itbecause theyre more busy about what they can take from you than giving backto the aviation community now this isnt about my selfrighteousness becauseanybody who knows me and knows my past and those that ive made mistakes in thepast ive broken the law ive done things that are illegal so its notabout that what its about is that youre stealing from our aviationcommunity and then youre trying to either sell back accounts or sellproducts to them after youve stolen from them and you dont want to giveanything back the idea of taking content from flight crew and cabin crew takingthat content for free without permission and then trying to sell something backto them is ridiculous to me you see if youre a new pilot or your new flight atit and you want to promote your instagramand you reached out to these companies that are taking all of your content forfree and posting out the videos of aviation but not you but theyre takingthat information and not really trying to push and grow aviation they just wantto take take take when you reach out to them and say hey listen im makingvideos or im doing a tutorial on how flight attendants can get their job orwhatever it is when you reach out to them to promote that you know what theysay oh yeah i can promote that but i want or i want so wait a secondyoure going to take my content without my permission and then when i want topromote something about aviation youre going to charge me to promote it nodont be the china of instagram you see back when before things blew up withkovat italy donated a bunch of masks to china but then when italy had theirproblem china wanted to sell those masks the exact same masks that italy donatedto them they wanted to sell them back to italy and i already hear some of yousaying oh well you take these hollywood versus reality youre taking these othermeme videos these are other things that people created yeah thats true i dotake them but im using that information to give value im explaining somethingim sharing some insight to what its like to be a crew member or somethingalong those lines these guys are not doing that theyre taking your videotheyre taking a picture and theyre posting it and theyre sharing that andthen theyre trying to sell you a tshirt or bracelet or show you ashoutout to promote something that youre doing to grow aviation or helpsomebody in aviation you see the whole thing behind my account everything thatim usually trying to do is give value im always trying to give value ineverything that i do i may be making jokes i may be tellingfunny stories and most of my videos but im always trying to give value theseparasites are doing nothing except leeching off of aviation so what can youdo about it well one you can do exactly what i do which is if you see a reallycool photo on one of these pages go to the person who made the content and golike and comment on their page unfollowed these scummy people who areout stealing content and of course if youre bored you can go ahead and markit as copyright theft on instagram and maybe their page will get taken down thenext thing you can do is never buy anything from one of these instagrampages that love aviation and theyre just out stealing content and theyreselling you tshirts or key rings now its one thing if theres a contentcreator that you like and hes made a tshirt or shes making a shirt or ahat or something like that and you want to support their channel thats totallydifferent thats not what these people are doing theyre stealing the contentand then selling stuff back to you and to all of you instagram pages are outthere stealing content if you really love this aviation niche so much whydont you go to flight school go become a flight attendant go become a mechanicdo something in aviation take the photos and videos yourself post it and stopstealing from everybody my guess is youre too lazy to go do that i hopeinstagram shuts down your page and youre stuck with a bunch of youroverpriced tshirts go contribute something to society instead of being aparasite in their niche if you love it so muchgo do something in it until then you can eat a bag,0.0

angry rant reasons why season amp,thank you for watching and sorry for the reupload netflix doesnt know what fair use is just found out there will be a th season,walking season three thirty reasons why we tell stories about things like substance abuse bullying sexual assault violence and suicide enjoy the show enjoy the conversation and take care of each other i just came back from watching the third season of reasons why ad are very very annoyed considering im not a fan at all of the show you might ask why did you and watch the second season and not to mention the third season well i hate watched it and to be honest i wasnt really actively watching it it was more background noise while i was working on my tall faces so yeah i didnt waste my time doing nothing and im more productive and faster when i have slightly entertaining background noise while im painting so there is a lot that i didnt like about the show starting from a misrepresentation of mental health trauma romanticization of depression suicide and glorification of school shootings yes im going to talk about each season and for people who didnt watch the show get comfortable get a snack as im gonna briefly and clearly tell you all the reasons why i had a committed suicide so lets start with a title reasons why reasons why i committed suicide reasons youre not realistically speaking theres always only one reason which is mental illness so its already a title it makes you think that if you have been bullied or abused it is justified to take your own life it gives young impressionable teenagers who maybe even have endured much worse abuse okay just end it all its almost saying yeah these are universal reasons for perfectly okay teen school having shown mental health problems to commit suicide so from the beginning its already black top source the book is bad trust me at least a show could have titled it better for example the german title for the show is bad girls dont lie which honestly fits this teen drama story way more but anyways justin foley is on her first tape he was her first crush first kiss and hannah blames justin for starting rumors that she is a so what happened was they were just kissing on a playground but justin later bragged to his friends that more had happened in the park you know im pretty sure that almost every woman has been called a in her life at some point not saying that this is okay but blaming such trivial namecalling to suicide is almost ridiculous alex standoff he released a heart or not list giving haneda titled best ass in the freshman class and hannah did not like that yeah thats pretty much it he said she had the best ass and i was like yep thats a legitimate reason to kill myself alex gets a whole tape just for a dad seriously he use that that im gonna copy strike this guy just for that word gonna copy strike him jessica davis head up names jessica for believing the rumors about her and jessica accused hannah for trying to steal alex from jessica so to give a little backstory under relationship all three used to be friends with each other alex and jessica used to date but then they broke up and jessica basically got frustrated with everything and blamed hannah for trying to steal her friend alex i dont know its typical teenage trauma not at all or reason to freakin blame and guilt trip time for her own suicide tyler down so hes an introvert kind of awkward kind of creepy and he took these stalkerish pictures of hannah through her bedroom window hannah dan asked for kourtneys help to find out who was taken to pictures they formed a friendly friendship but somehow kourtney and hannah ended up kissing in her bedroom and tyler took another photo of that and spent a picture over the school courtney crimson so in the book shes basically a fakeass girl who lied about finding sex toys in hannahs bedroom and in a show they kissed in hannahs bedroom but in school courtney acted as if nothing happened and she even tried to avoid hannah after these pictures got leaked marcus cole so he had a date with hannah he tried to make some moves on her but she rejected him he was salty yeah thats pretty much it i had probably at least encounters like just zach dempsey okay so this was actually a really interesting character and i dont understand why he deserved to have a tape do you be honest no one on hannas list deserve to have a tape but him and clay especially like if you watch the show you can see that hes genuinely a good person and although his friends are a bunch of douche bags he doesnt condone any assault or bullying he doesnt even actively partake in it so after marcus tries to use hanna sexual sorry for her and tries to comfort her but she ignores him and you know thats okay she probably just shin by his toxic friends whatever the next day zak still feels sorry for her and confesses to her that he wished he had gotten matched with hanna for the valentine survey and what does hanna do she not only doesnt believe him she yells at him sex friends tease him for trying to talk to hanna but it is implied that his intentions were pure and humanly liked hanna after being humiliated by hanna sac got revenge on her by stealing and throwing away all of hannas notes in a brown paper bag program so basically there was always a set of facts at the back of the room where students could leave compliments for each other and sach had been removing those notes kind of childish what he did to her but its like he was being nice to hanna he tried to comfort her try to lowkey tell her that he doesnt believe in those stupid rumors and on top of that he actually did like her but the whole time hanna was being an to him and yes section have removed those notes but its like girl hanna did she really sing that she got suicidal because she couldnt read any compliments anymore imagine being dead selfentitled i feel like she would also get depressed if someone deleted the compliments on her latest instagram selfie ryan shaver so he was briefly friends with hanna when the two attended a poetry class and after regaining her trust ryan stole and anonymously published one of hannahs poems and a new school paper despite the anonymous submission hanna was humiliated when her poem received criticism no one in class didnt even know that it was from hanna so it doesnt even freaking and if you watch the show you can see that its not even like they were seeing that poetry is garbage they just chuckle at it make fun of a few lines and thats it unless i forget that ryan stole and anonymously published it because he thought it was amazing and he wanted more people to read it his intentions were good of course he should not have published it without her consent but girl he loved your poetry and he just wanted more people to love it cheri homeland cheri takes hannah home from a party she crashed her car into a stop sign and chose not to meet the party this event eventually led to a death of a classmate justin foley i dont know why he was on the th day began because that story ultimately had nothing to do with hannah so basically hannah blames him for allowing bryce to rape jessica and its absolutely horrible what happened to jessica but its really that really has nothing to do with hannah thats jessica sand justins business not yours why is this a personal reason to kill yourself just say you wanted to spill some tea and go clay johnson although she says he does not deserve to be on the list she still put him there okay so just gets kind of confusing an irritating so let me calm down for a bit so they kissed it was mutual they obviously had very strong feelings for each other but then after the kiss she gets flashbacks and screams at clays saying she wants to be alone clays like what is everything okay she screams again go away he goes away but then in the recording she says why did you leave me i wanted you to stay and comfort me cannot out i bet you walked out the door like i told you to whyd you have to leave it was the worst thing oh bryce walker at the first party hannah attends bryce rapes unconscious jessica then a few days later had a wanders outside in the middle of the night sees a party going on at bryces place keep in mind that at that time she knows that bryce is a rapist okay so when bryce sees hannah he invites her into a hot tub okay pause pause every sane a normal girl would be like no thanks and go home not only is he a rapist but throughout the show it is shown that he is a bully called hannah a was mean to hannahs friends she knows all that about him so what does she do she joins the rapist in the hot tub i dont understand his character at all so the next thing what happens is really awful bryce rapes her when she does not actively resist him and its actually pretty traumatizing to watch because they actually showed a really realistic rape scene because the way she freezes up and doesnt resist him is how most sexual molestation is play out so now a lot of people on the internet share the opinion that bryce was the only one who deserve to be on the tapes dosed bryce deserve to get a tape to be under reasons to kill yourself list i really want you guys to think about it because i think blaming someone for their own suicide is delusional its never other peoples fault in the end its always mental health problems that makes people consider and attempt suicide you have to be mentally kind of wonky to even think about hurting yourself do you think its okay to tell millions of people that it is justified to end your own life if someone rapes you mr reporter is a school counselor and hannah claims that he failed to help anna when she seek out help but he did try to help he asked questions he offered to call the cops the parents he reassured her that he will do everything to protect her in the process but he needs to know what even happens he needs to know what happened he needs to know the name hanna doesnt even tell him who or if he even raped her she doesnt answer any questions clearly shes extremely vague and when mr porter asks did something even happen she gets triggered and just sleeps and like clay he tries to stop her asks her if she wants to discuss it further if theres something else that she wants to talk about he calls her a name while shes heading out and then of course hes like okay she doesnt want me to bother her anymore im gonna respect it ive stopped and what does hanna do she walked out of his office and she hoped hed come after her hes not coming some of you cared none of you cared enough and this pisses me off because she almost seems happy that this happened she prepares her suicide like its nothing and oh by the way before she commits suicide she records all these tapes and not one time while recording she thinks maybe im overreacting me to discourage victim blaming is not the best way to send my intended message nope not at all some of the people on the tapes barely did anything wrong sure they were not angels but listing them as a reason for suicide rap by the way the means that came out of that are so funny inaccurate lets talk about the suicide scene so in the book she takes a bunch of pills and her mom finds her dead body and in the show she slits her wrists while being in a fully filled bathtub they really tried to make it extra girls and shocking and they show everything how she slits her wrists slowly how she waits till she bleeds out and im really baffled why they chose it to do it that way cos realistically if you slit your wrists it all works to percent of the time and if it is successful at all it takes almost to hours for you to bleed out and die so i think since committing suicide is easier and way more successful when we just overdose on sleeping pills to writers probably choose to show to suicide in that way so if any copycats tried at home at least it wont be successful statistically speaking i dont know either way they should have just cut it out i would be ok if it was just a shallow teen drama background noise entertainment you know like riverdale but the show takes itself so serious with all these trigger warnings talks and interviews how important it is for students to watch this show so youre doing a service to parents to help them with their kids understanding this dont you think yeah yeah reason why you should watch reasons why there are a ton of good messages a bunch of beautiful amazing actors the writings brilliant the crew behind its awesome i mean the main goal and i think overall is just to start conversational i mean because these conversations people need to talk about this start a conversation you need to start a conversation etc but then they go and oversimplify it a serious subject matter also these teenagers dont act like teenagers at all the dialogue is awful and so obviously written by a year old who doesnt know anything about how young people talk dude you have a can and ask are all my scars were inside your boy clays in some hey clay and he should change his name to tyler my fellow asked last colleague and extreme outcast its like the last person in the world left that doesnt know what is patronesses muggles right characters are not likable or charismatic hennis an entitled selfrighteous vengeful girl with a heavy victim mentality jessica is just annoying and frustrating to watch tony takes himself way too serious the whole onedimensional jock group act like cliche high school bullies clay constantly looks like hes in pain and he only has angsty or pretentious stuff to say and overall the acting is just way too overdramatic season so there was absolutely no reason for netflix to make another season hannah story was told the book ends here i freaking hate capitalism so in the second season dur started revolves around hannah baker card case against the school parents decided to sue the school for negligence again testimonials from each student that appear on the tapes we get more flashbacks to the past and additional stories that make no sense i proudly sark and hannah had a relationship hannah hung out with fries multiple times alex tried to kill himself didnt succeed although he used a whole gun to shoot himself in the head and this is really frustrating because alex has not shown any sense of mental health problem suppression anything in the first season so its so out of character that he did something like that to himself it just seems like the showrunners just wanted more characters struggling with problems and disabilities to make the show more entertaining and its so funny how the first season received huge backlash from viewers so they put a bunch of trigger warnings and cuts to their episodes and they keep using those poor actors for his trigger warnings saying how they wanna start a conversation or to raise awareness yeah yeah youre totally not capitalizing off of triggering subject matter at all if they really wanted to raise awareness at least it would have done some kind of research on how to accurately depict these serious major themes on tv but im repeating myself another annoying character is fries throughout the whole season he denies doing anything to hanna continuous being dis really onedimensional evil villain like i cant even take him serious cuz its so black and white and one of his jock friends tries to silence the other schoolmates with scare tactics to keep their mouth shut for the trial its so stupid at the end bryce gets arrested cuz jessica confesses to the police and you would think hey thats actually satisfying ending the rapist gets his punishment everyone else gets their closure but no they try to tackle yet another touchy topic tyler has been constantly bullied by the jocks especially monty in season one and two and later also free but eventually he does find friends in season two he dates his crush but she eventually leaves him and so do his friends which makes him feel lonely and depressed he tries to get better by entering a program to control his anger after he finishes it he seems to be i guess cured i would say he comes back happy and seemingly healthy but then unfortunately he not only gets beat up in the boys bathroom by monty and his friends he also gets scraped by a broom handle i understand the intent of showing this explicit scene but the way the creators decided to show it is still way too far and too graphic it feels like im watching a snuff film a final destination see its its so traumatizing and like you you can show how horrible rape is without actually having to portray a rape scene a few shortcuts and then maybe a lingering shot on the bloody broom handle would have been much more impactful and tasteful than dismas so anyway after he gets abused he decides to gear up and shoot up the school but he stopped by clay the hero what a hero what i think is really frustrating instead to show once again failed to give tireless character a history of being mentally ill it wasnt established at all yes they show us that his introverted shy kind of awkward but who isnt to be honest i can tell you that at every high school there are at least of the students who are exactly like tyler im like tyler so the show is kind of telling its audience that its rational for someone who was abused to become this school shooter it conveys this weird faulty message of bullying makes people drive themselves to either suicide or violence which is not hundred percent true yes it might fuel it but a root problem is always mental illness which they never ever showed or if they showed it it was probably so bad and incorrect that i didnt catch it at all so unfortunately a lot of people enjoy the second season and of course the show runners want to capitalize on the fact that people like show and they mate yet another unnecessary season so the show which was once about suicide is not a teeny murder mystery show i dont know what happened either so to give you a short summary it basically revolves around frances death someone killed him and clay and this new girl and are trying to find out who it was questioning everyone in school so i found the first two seasons much more easier to binge watch but this season felt so slow the episodes tracked on way too long and i hate it how clay and annie always quickly jumped on conclusions on who killed bryce they were always accusing random characters for killing him episode after episode it almost felt comical at one point an even accuses clay for killing bryce cuz of jealousy like dont flatter yourself first of all and second of all who are you claim im telling you right now bro if bryce would have went to long beach jordan kerr would have been dead in season one oh god who are you boys talking about bryce tyler who are you and why are you and me and my mans business clay who is this im new here i know everything thats everyone okay they keep teasing and teasing and thirteen hours later we finally get an answer on who killed bryce and a reveal its very disappointing more on that later a nice new character who narrates the whole story she shares her experiences with meeting certain characters and she forms this force relationship with clay and also lives in frances house you know the more i think about it it more it feels like a selfinsert fanfiction a lot of people hate the character connieyc saying she was an annoying unnecessary character didnt fit the story at all she never met her own business was always in the corner watching and judging as the personal questions young young janna and for me i dont know i actually started watching the season in english as always but something about arnies british accent and the way she talked made me feel really irritated so i switched to german tops and it was much more bearable to listen to her narration so i dont know i didnt find her that annoying but i do understand the frustration some viewers have with this character because she really she really feels like a wattpad white ant character i hate you so much she sleeps with bryce even after she learns what he did to her friend jessica and i dont know she she kind of feels like a rave apologist and you know what i really dont like this character i must admit what do you think that is i think youre lonely i think you dont know you can trust i think youve hurt people but if i were you i wouldnt believe everything you hear i agree why see i hundred percent support free speech even if it can be a bit harsh on the internet but away some people were showing their dislike for this character is just awful instead of saying the character ani is bad or telling to show writers that i should have done a better job with his character these haters seek out the actors twitter instagram and attack and bully her from ruining reasons why its gone even so bad that the actor grace had to delete all of her twitter pictures even her whole instagram account and then went private everywhere a similar thing happened to justin prentiss actor who played brice he also had to endure a lot of internet bullying calling him a rapist just for playing a role you guys still know that hes acting you are following this actor for something he didnt do brice is awful so a lot of social media responses you know rapists your rapist regardless really of what picture i pose and go check out reasons why so you can also hate me on social media tim is not monty the show related a bad job conveying her message against bullying bryces character change is so jarring because in season and hes so onedimensional evil even after hannahs death the multiple confrontation with his schoolmates him being called rapist etc he still denied every allegation and just continued being a flat evil character with no emotional depth and then all of a sudden in season hes like yeah man i up im trying to change im gonna go back to school and try to apologize to everyone im doing yoga with my mom and im gonna act like a real victim cos world is just being so unfair to me sorry but i have zero cuz i dont believe him first of all his character had no emotional growth throughout all the seasons and now because you know hes gonna die at the writers try to make me sympathize with him no no for everything that happened after what happened was that you raped me while i was unconscious and then wide about its everybody just im not that person anymore i believe and his stuff makes also no sense all the bad guys deserve to die apparently the killer which is alex by the way yes shocking no motive at all like i dont understand his motive and i hate i absolutely hate how to narrow to annies like you see everyone had a good reason to kill bryce no what kind of sick message are you trying to convey again thirteen reasons why all rapists deserve to die and a killer the freakin killer gets off without any charges im sorry no no one deserves to die first of all all what brides deserved is a long jail time a lot of consulting and monitoring not an awful unnecessary death like this and not to mention how no one had a good reason to kill him in this season but it could make sense what the was alexs motive so before i talk about monty can we acknowledge how he is supposed to be a seventy year old but is played by an actor who is literally thirty two these guys are almost thirty as well and the rest of the cast are a bunch of adults in their late s and im gonna be honest and say they all look very old like ken high school movies and tv shows finally get actual sixteen year olds to play as students because i can kind of see oldest face im your oldest screaming uh so anyway monty was actually one of the most interesting characters in this season he showed us that his father is quite violent towards his son he is very homophobic too and seems to also have an alcohol problem and later in a flashback to a party it is revealed that monty is gay and hes extremely conflicted about it he has selfhatred he projects his own deeprooted insecurities onto others and i was very intrigued to see how his character is going to develop during this season but they just took the easy route and just killed him off at the ends just like brice all this building up to nothing twelve hours of trying to redeem prices character and then you just kill him what a disappointing ending man so they are protecting the real killer because he is a good person and he set up monte to be a murderer cuz he is bad on one hand to show tries to show us with brice that things are not always so black and white but then they end the show in a black and white way it just seems like the riders just got tired at the end and off dont try to make your evil characters complex when youre just gonna throw them away in the end cant believe that the most uninteresting bland character that had no reason to do anything killed bryce so we learned that all bad people died in early horrible death and all the good people who get up you see to get a chance to better themselves or to get to give to others with their sick revenge suicide before i end this round i want to talk about some scenes in episodes which surprisingly i really liked so even though im still confused by tylers character and his motivations i do like to way the writers depicted the healing part and that they showed that everyone has their own healing pace i like that he finally talked about what happened and that clay tried to actually get him professional help rather than just trying to help him on his own as per usual i love this scene i think it was very powerful really motivating and inspiring and its just so satisfying to see tyler opening up and to watch how hes finally getting better is actually really nice and i like the way that they showed that hes not alone and there are also other male victims like him yeah not a bad scene to be honest its very encouraging very moving i also like to episodes with tony the plot about his family getting deported i think they showed pretty accurately how families get torn apart this way and also the revelation that this was a reason why hes always so mysterious and doesnt talk much about his family situation like his character it all makes sense now so yeah i thought this was very good too and yeah thats about it all in all four out of ten i would recommend watching it let me know in the comments below if you agree or disagree with me and yeah i will see you guys next week

keith olbermann slammed for latest angry rant against republicans,fox friends cohost brian kilmeade joined the faulkner focus to discuss the fbis response to the twitter files and keith,we are going to get brian kilmeades take on the big story of the day the fbi finally responding following this latest batch of twitter files writing them off as the work of quote conspiracy theorists the bureau insisting that its actions were nothing out of the ordinary and that they reimbursed twitter for standard legal requests critics say the reported three and a half million dollars spent was used to suppress information including the new york post reporting on hunter bidens laptop the fbi says it did not provide twitter quote any specific instruction or details regarding the hunter biden laptop story now some quick to the point uh uh its a little wiggle room here in that statement it was not a blanket denial of conversations with twitter about hunter the fbi says quote it is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the american public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency kellyanne conway says americans should be worried to have our chief law enforcement officers up to fbi agents in one report a routinely saying to twitter you have to look at this tweet you have to look at that persons postings while were in an election season this is frightening to me as an american citizen to think that this is going on under the guise of some official operation theyre sitting on the scales of a free speech theyre sitting on the scales of justice as promised we have brian kilmeade cohost of fox and friends and host of one nation with brian kilmeade live with us from his radio studio uh brian thank you so much for joining me merry christmas im excited to get a chance to chat with you about this you work all day long morning noon almost noon night right and now were sharing networks sharing audiences molly always great to see you great to see you in new york i was i was waiting for the fbi pushback but i thought it would be more professional i thought it would be like one would think you know and somewhat limited but its a its an aggressive pushback and naming people that have a problem with their action as conspiracy theorists that sounds like something i would see on msnbc or on cnn with every single hosts yeah i i think thats what well thats why i was shocked at i thought it was going to be an exfbi agent blasted back but i didnt know it was the actual fbi but let me just say from what you just said on the intro uh this is how its counteracted not only did i think the fbi was over his keys was ice done that they were doing this matt taibi feels the same way who was able to disseminate and publish all this stuff michael schellenberg the same way and also the other guy named joel roth who theyre talking about was he the one who said if he didnt feel as though the fbi was breathing down his neck telling him what to do and getting his uh antenna up for wouldbe hunter biden what listen to what he said under oath they learned in the meetings that there were rumors of a hack and leak operation that would involve hunter biden excuse me that is joel roth the vice president of twitter and meanwhile theyre saying the fbi is saying were gaslighting with the conspiracy theorist by lifting listening to a liberal executive at twitter who was being directly interacting with the fbi so they said that he was directly he understood that this hunterbind thing was coming down the line and elvis chan is somebody who feels hes been on uh um unjustly called out but elvis chan i have news for you roth says that you you guys brought up the hunter biden laptop so when it came out they were ready for something that looked exactly like you were war gaming with them in the tabletop exercises at the aspen institute with the new york times washington post uh and all these other outlets and ill bring something else into play uh not only is the hunter under hunter buying laptop a player in twitter mark zuckerberg told the same thing to joe rogan we were told by the fbi that something exactly like this was coming down the line so dont put if the fbi is mad at us its because its been exposed these are fair questions about free speech on you know these platforms that americans are participating in and you certainly you know dont need to act like people are nuts because theyre asking the questions you know something else i want to talk to you about former msnbc anchor keith olberman had this advice that he brought up for house democrats urging them to fight back against republicans when they officially take back the house in january and he means fight take a listen i wish the democrats would play that game to ten percent of the the levels that the republicans do until the democrats stop rolling over for this and saying well were not going to dirty our hands when they go high we go low so when they go low we get baseball bats that should be the next you know big lets get obama out there saying when they go low we get baseball bats i think that would solve this completely yeah i dont know how to vote it his uh following is uh but im hoping that no one actually goes out and grabs baseball bats maxine waters will be proud um go after them wherever they go in their stores wherever they follow follow them and guess what that was happening with sarah huckabee sanders and all the other uh you know all the other players during the trump year or wherever they want so what is going to be happening now is people are going to come out of the woodwork and feel as though they got to go and try to marginalize uh try to marginalize the republican majority in the house theyre going to be big players once they pick kevin mccarthy a speaker and i hope indeed they do but molly i just got to warn you about pretending that keith obermans relevant the only thing consistent with keith olberman is the word former because everywhere he gets hired he gets fired so hes former espn former msnbc and he leaves angry and he sits in his apartment and he tweets things that are totally inappropriate so i just warn you against making keith obermann relevant but i do think that if the the five people that follow him that theyre going to grab bats he should be personally responsible and why watch over men when you can watch brian kilmeade now later today into the evening thank you so much brian we appreciate you joining us thank you go get him molly thanks so much for having me appreciate it hey everyone im emily compagno catch me and my cohost harris faulkner and kaylee mcineny on outnumbered every weekday at pm eastern or sets your dvr also dont

superman reboot disaster angry rant,help me here does it make any sense to make a multiverse superman before finishing the arc of the iconic superman where is,so in what world a company decides to work with the multiverse character prior to even setting up properly the original character oh well welcome to the warner brothers a mess because unfortunately theres no one like kevin feige inside that company that has vision so guys we are getting black superman now am i against the black superman storyline of course not i think on its own it would have been a great thing its just like the miles morales i loved spiderman spider versus spiderman into the spiderverse with miles morales i think hes a really great character but would people want to see that prior to seeing the iconic one first we only have one superman film with harry cavill man of steel and thats it and then we see him in other films but we dont have that trilogy yet you guys go ahead and give wonder woman another film after the the latest mess but but not a superman when harry cavill i mean why are we watching a multiverse character prior to even fixing the original one what is going on in warner brothers you know i just find this extremely annoying uh and of course jj abram is involved uh and im glad that hes not involved with the original iconic superman theres not a lot of uh news exactly what is happening in the story line the only thing that is saying the news is broke and its everywhere is that jj abram is producing and the writer is some uh this guy over here his name is ta nahini coates hes a heavily political guy uh he hes a journalist so hes the one thats going to be writing the black superman storyline the black superman is called calvin alice i know nothing about calvin ellis uh but i did some research and hes basically the multiverse superman he is not the original hes not replacing clark kent is thats not what is happening here and like i said i will say it again because people like to take everything that other people say out of context and not even watch the entire video and already like any angry comments and i just want to say im not against the storyline i think this would have been a great thing just like miles morales however dont you think you should have focused on the main superman first i mean this is extremely annoying im sorry that im coming off as a rent because i am mad i dont know how many times i said this but i really wish they werent the ones in charge of superman batman and wonder woman i mean we did have some really good films like the joker we did have great trilogy with batman but they cant get superman right you know how are you gonna make a movie about uh the multiverse superman calvin alice im not interested in that because you didnt even give me the trilogy of the original guy yet are you serious this is extremely irritating no thats not how youre supposed to ah thats that is just i think to to go with another trend because thats what hollywood does remember in the whole meet when the whole me too came out what we had a lot of ghostbusters a lot of uh charlie angel all these films that are just pushed pushing an agenda and theyre not really focused on the real issue that people why people started the metoo movement its a bunch of fake people in hollywood that just want to uh make money out of uh on the other peoples pain lets put it that way because thats the truth they are not really caring about representation and all of that they just want to uh monetize the what is trending right now which was the black lives movement thats why were getting this uh before even having the original superman uh trilogy i mean whats the reason that they dont focus on the original superman first oh yes because they think the guy is boring maybe hes not relatable people dont find him relatable i am just so done with this im just just so irritated i just hate this you know uh because of course i think in warner brothers the problem their problem is exactly this is because their head is all over the place theres not one person dictating what should we do first and now we are working with our multiverse when we dont even have the original iconic one fixed yet how does this make any sense i mean we heard about rumors of henry calvin coming back but only for cameos there is nothing planned for a movie shouldnt we have the iconic superman first and then we work without multiverse i mean am i saying something wrong here im open for suggestions just leave your comments down below and now tell me what you think and obviously this will be a heavily politicized film because thats what is trending nowadays uh and like i said i think this would have been a great thing on its own if we had the trilogy first you know you first need to focus on the original main character we only have men of steel where is men of steel too like i does that make any sense to anybody else or its only me uh lets have a look what the hollywood reporter is saying here jj abrams is producing the feature which according to sources is being set up as black superman storyline so still not confirmed but a lot of places are talking about this im pretty sure its confirmed acclaimed novelist nessie coates has been hired to pen the script for a feature reboot of superman because thats all we need produced by jj abrams uh i heard that jj evans were going to do the justice dark justice league dark and i was like thats fine just dont touch superman wonder woman batman which is mainly the the minor characters anyways and i just dont i dont want jj amaz anywhere near superman because you know its enough of what hes done with star wars and he didnt even know what to do with luke skywalker so he put him to the side and then ron johnson came and destroyed the character and now uh here he comes for dc next this is so irritating to be inviting to the dc extended universe dc film bad robot is an honor so coach is really happy and then hes and then he continues i look forward to uh meaningfully adding the legacy of american most iconic mythic hero oh perhaps michael b jordan will be cast i think hell be the best option i think hes a great actor i think he was great in black panther and he hes fit enough to play a version of superman and like i said and i would say it again im not really against this i think this would have been great if it was not just being used uh for a tick list again thats im sure im sure because if theyre not if we dont even have the original superman storyline yet we dont even have another movie and now theyre gonna do the multiverse these people they dont care about the fans they dont care about you they dont care about superman at all this is a character that has been around for what years he was the grandfather of superman heroes pretty much the first one you know the most iconic one and they dont even give us the trilogy and theyre working with the multiverse character because thats their priority right now this is what i have an issue with you know and usually i dont really make angry rents um but sometimes stuff like this just gets on your nerve because uh i just find that this hypocrisy inside hollywood is just extremely infuriating you know because this is only being made because of the trend that we have right now its not really because they care thats what is even more annoying you know and not only that i just dont know what kind of relation this superman will have with harry cavill now let me just read you a little bit of calvin ellis calvin alis kryptonian name kalel also known as superman is a kryptonia president of the united states on a different earth in the multiverse on his earth he became superman in addition to being the president its likely hes uh native to uh vargo island due to his reference to the word battle i dont know if im pronouncing that right he operates from the white house where brainiac serves as his personal computer and even covers for him while he is on duty as superman uh final crisis so like i said uh warner brothers is now more concerned with dealing with a multiverse but we dont even know what is actually happening with the original iconic superman uh how amazing you know uh another way to im pretty sure this movie sounds like its going to be very political especially because the writer is someone that talks a lot about cultural issues and uh i mean i dont feel that this will be anything like the miles morales spiderman into into the spiderverse because that movie was incredible it not only made so much money it just deserved a lot of praise what a great film uh i fell in love with miles morales through that film and i think this would have been this the same thing if it was done well and not only that if it was done after we finished the trilogy of superman first uh but im sure that they are doing something with the flashpoint perhaps thats where everything is going to be linked but thats the news guys i just hope that uh soon enough they figure out what is happening with the main iconic superman because you have to do something with the main character right i mean youre doing something with wonder woman uh aquaman already has a movie and flash has a movie but we we dont know anything about superman yet i just would like to know whats happening there but anyways thats the news uh sorry for the rant drop your comments down below id love to hear your thoughts on all of this uh and if you enjoyed this video dont forget to hit that thumbs up subscribe for more and see you

calling out wannabe entrepreneurs angry rant,its time to call out the fake entrepreneurs watch this video and find out about real entrepreneurship get your free,yo whats up max tornow here welcome back to the channel in this video i wanna callout wanna be entrepreneurs all these people outthere that are you know all the people that write on instagram entrepreneur ceo of investor cause they bought some bitcoin at youre gonna think im an beep people think that either way already go check out the comments who cares but anyways what i wanna talk about i wanna talk about real entrepreneurship versus fake entrepreneurship and how theyre so many fakes out there and a lot of things thatpeople are doing wrong so if you like the idea of you know being an entrepreneur becomingself employed yourself maybe you are self employedto a degree already if you like the idea ofbeing a type of person who has a legit online business that can actually sustain them during the crisis sustainthem for many years so you be can free travel the world drive around do whatever you want then pay attention that videos for you and its important to understand they understand the difference between real entrepreneurship andfake entrepreneurship have you ever wondered whether there is more to lifethan a boring dead end nine to five job have you ever dreamed about breaking free and traveling the world making good money and just enjoying life no more office dress codeno morning commute no boss this channel is for you so heres to your freedom so theres certain levelsof wannabe entrepreneurs and i wanna kinda diveon all of these together so first level of wanna be entrepreneurs are the people that are building a brand and really working on themselves and thusly thinkingthey are entrepreneurs but they are actuallymaking literally zero money and we gotta hop over to some bump here this is crazy imma call you out if you dont make money yourenot an entrepreneur okay i dont care if you have a brand and youre building your littletiktok and your instagram i dont care if you have a podcast where you and your broke friends are talking about cool stuffand youre building a brand and i dont care ifyoure gonna youre gonna have a brand deal soonwith some other whack fake entrepreneurs so youcan sell their shirts if youre not making moneyyoure not an entrepreneur boom full stop thats it okay and that links us to whatmost people actually do when it comes to entrepreneurship and why theyre doing it most people wanna be an entrepreneur so theyre cool right so they are respected so they look like an interesting person so they can i dont know overcompensate that nobody in school like them or thought they were cool if youre in it for those reasons youre gonna have a bad time okay because you cant pay bills on being cool you cant pay bills on being liked you cant afford avacation or a nice car on people respecting you you cant and i wish it was like thatbut it isnt like that and on a side note im literally driving i dont even know where im driving we just said hey lets go rent cool car drive around imbored im sick and tired of the quarantine soim just driving around wanna be transparent to you and certainly better than sitting at home or certainly better than rotting away in a nine to five job so we gotta understand this why are you in this for entrepreneurship out of our own experienceand breaking with hundreds of clients workingwith hundreds of clients that are successfuland working with people that wanna be successful but cant do it is the following thing you should be in entrepreneurship because you wanna make money andyou wanna help people these are the only two reason and ideally its a combination of both okay the more people you wanna help the more money you can make and the more money you wanna make the more people you can help if youre in it to be cool or be liked to be respected go dosomething else okay become a politician or pro wrestler or twitch streamer idont know i dont care but dont be an entrepreneur okay the other thing is dofirst then talk about it let your actions speak not your words nowadays in social mediaeverybody is posting on facebook i hatefacebook community i just i just wanted to say that im building my own business and all your broke friendsare giving you likes and thumbs up who cares go make money first its nowadays its almost like saying that youre gonna dosomething is worth more than actually doing something its so crazy so go do things let your actions speak for themselves the other thing is what happens and thats the second level is the wannabe entrepreneursthey get some results okay they stumble into theirfirst couple sales maybe theyre making a couple thousands maybe theyre cracking a month their first k month all of a sudden and now what happens isthey connected to their ego to their sense of selfand they say things like oh im making k a month i must be really smart i must be really amazing theyre getting their ego involved and that is the worstthing that you can do and by all means i wannabe transparent here ive been there myself ive been that wannabe entrepreneur that made their first four figures five figures now thinkingthat im the grand host genius person every idiot i could teach a monkey how to makek a month literally go sit down a monkey and havehim say the right things teach him the sign language what im saying is whathappens often times is people get their ego involved and then the better theythink of themselves the more difficult it isto teach them new things and thats a very very bad thing i remember when i made my first consistent dollars a month im like im makingmore money than my uncle my uncles a goddamn doctor in austria and im like im this guy in his s im making all this money four to five thousand dollars a month im making all this money im so good and its crazy because i actually got caught in this positive feedback loop for over a year reallypay attention here positive feedback is great it makes you feel good thats amazing but if youre caught ina positive feedback loop over a longer period of time youre gonna have a veryvery bad time and heres why so i was in a positive feedback loop i was making my four fivethousand dollars a month and all i had was two cinematographers two videographers there are young guys who looking up to me they were fans they loved what im doing they record the videos i told them to they edited the videos andi was just sitting at home and everybodys likeyes max good idea max of course max and im like yeah im the mofo supergrand deals entrepreneur here im the best yeah andi had that for over a year until i realized heymax hold on a second for you in order to get to your first four to five thousand dollars a month you have to feel reallybad about yourself you have to feel like an idiot you have to feel like a moron you have to feel likeyou dont know anything and now over the last year you havent had any growth why is that and i had this thought in myself hold on a secondand i looked at my team of these two yes sayersgod bless them great guys amazing guys stillgood friends with them but at the same time im like hold on a second these guysare not gonna make me step up these guys are not gonnacall me out on my bs these guys are not gonna help me scale and make my business bigger so i realized i was in thispositive feedback loop so what im saying here and thats a big big problem it is very easy to get a person to their first k a month because usually their ego doesnt get involved but out of our own experience every time we bring a clientfrom zero to k a month could be that it gets alittle later for them its from zero from k a month every time we do thattheir mindset kicks in and they get a little bitof an ego around that and that gets more and more difficult the more money they make the most difficult part isaround the a month almost like a glass ceiling that is where get a lot ofpeople reaching out to us they say hey were making k a month can you help us scale and every time we help them scale we first have to work on their mindset we first have to kind of break them down and empty their vessel right if youve seenavatar remember avatar that old movie from what was or something like that where they say you cant fill a vessel that is already filledor something like that im not even sure if its from that movie but thats exactly what happens once people make their first to k they fill their vessel with self thought positive self thoughts with patting yourself on the shoulder with being this greatgrandeous entrepreneur and that vessel gets filled up more and more and more and more and its harder and harderto teach them something and again and that is where a mentor that has grownbeyond you actually kicks in and helps you so much causethe mentor is able to be like hey youre full of beep okay sorry we gotta beep that out hey youre full of bs you dont know enough okay to k a month is nothing and im gonna tell you that as well if youre derping around to k thats laughable youre not a real entrepreneur youre someone who stumblesinto a couple sales and that is it it is your responsibility to keep scaling beyond to k now do i say k a monthis not a lot of money and i dont value it oh oh my god i value thehell out of a month a month i think thatsvery nice to live on that its good okay its not the safest amountthat youre getting each month it doesnt mean you cant support your unlimited family members from that again the crisis happens but im saying its a good number and ill take k a monthover a nine to five job all day everyday but at the same time it is in your responsibilityto keep scaling and you have to understand that these wannabe entrepreneurs are people that think of themselves asthese grandeous entrepreneurs but in fact theyre justmaking a bunch of money and they dont even knowhow they can do it more how they can do it moreconsistently okay what are these wannabe entrepreneurs doing in the crisis now too and this is the craziest part well talk about this in a second on a side note go check out our podcast nikita vuncowich oursales manager and myself with this very informative and also very entertaining podcast were gonna put a link in the description were gonna have it appearsome here right now definitely go check out our podcast if youre commuting a lotif youre siting at home if you wanna dive a little deeper on certain concepts thatim talkin about here that podcast is for you many people say oh the youtube stuff is a little too much on the surface if you wanna dive deeperdefinitely check out our podcast highly recommend that now lets talk about allthese wannabe entrepreneurs that have been makinga little bit of money while the economy wasgrowing and expanding everythings going well where are these wannabeentrepreneurs now in the crisis how many wannabe entrepreneurs have seen their sales literally collapse like a house of cards to zero why because they think theyre grandeous and they know everything but they dont and their ego keeps them from actually reachingout to somebody else and getting help andthat is the worst thing that you can do you should always be humble you should always tell yourself hey i dont know anythingor i dont know enough you gotta always be growing dont stop growing onceyou reach your k im begging you dont make that mistake i see it so many times with our clients when we get them to their first k we have to break them down again and pull them up from below and say hey k a month is notenough stop with your ego bs and every time we helpthem scale beyond k k theyre grateful thatwe kept pushing them and thats the same that mymentors are doing for us were making multipleseven figures a year now our mentors are makingmultiple eight figures a year and its kind of this likecounter for us to my ego cause im thinking like oh im doing pretty well goddamn it multiple seven figures is something thats beyond my wildest dreams but theyre like more keep pushing its your responsibilityyou have employees max you have team members you have family you wanna take care of all these people keep pushing you can still do more you can still help more people and the funny thing is too if you check that out oninstagram or on this youtube you see me driving around this fancy car its totally fine if to the outside in terms of marketing yourethe cool guy or the cool girl youre the smart personyou got it figured out its totally fine ifthat is your marketing to have some cockiness tohave a little bit of arrogance because of within your realm the knowledge that youve accumulated totally fine but on the inside internally you have to be humble you have to be the most humble you couldpossibly find yourself in you wanna sit at a tableor on a virtual table and you wanna feel dumb okay i hope you get what im tryingto say with this metaphor if youre sitting at a table if you know a lot of people and they all look up to you and they all think youre the greatest youre at the wrong table you have to sit at a tablewhere you feel like an idiot because only then you can grow and dont make that mistakethat i made years ago where for a whole year iwas the boss on the table i was the grandeous entrepreneur and everybody was lookingup to me dont do that because it stuns your growth and its very very bad for your future and for the people thatmight depend on you friends family and so on and so forth so this is a little bit of arant video as you can see here and you probably knowthis from my marketing im an arrogant beep outside but on the inside you shouldsee how my mentor talks to me and how im tucking my tail in and how im like yes mentoryoure right youre right because at the end of the day id rather be rich than be right id rather have the mentor be right and thusly i can scale my business help more people and make more money than thinking of myselfas this great person you can think that at the gym if you want you could think that whenyoure out with your girlfriend or whoever right but when it comes to business you have to have that sense of humility and thats why all thesewannabe entrepreneurs out there are full of bs and whythey are continuously going to be annihilatedby people like my clients by ourselves my people thatare doing it the right way if you dont have someone that helps you to continuously grow if you dont have someonethat keeps pushing you then youre gonna go down all right and the opposite of growthis not being stagnant the opposite of growthis doing the wrong things and thinking youre great all right even if youre growing alittle bit by yourself you can grow much more ifyou actually have help and that is why being awannabe entrepreneur is bs so to summarize that number one if youre not making moneyyoure not an entrepreneur if youre in it to becool and to be respected and to be looked atupon as a great person then youre doing itfor the wrong reasons you should be in entrepreneurship to make money and tohelp people all right and these two things actuallycoincide with each other theyre intertwined all right and most importantlyif you dont keep going youre actually stagnating all right continuously seek helpcontinuously seek growing continuously make surethat youre on a table or a virtual table or thatyoure in contact with people that make you feel stupid k a month k a month laughable keep growing all right sounds great whether

perfect what oh come on game come on i ve pulled that off so many times frickin frick just change my irl username im tempted actually to change my name i know my parents would hate it but it actually if im gonna go full time it would be a really smart move to change my name thats a freaking yeah i don t need to explain what just happened there right thats the thing i dont yell what or be like ah i failed you guys are smart enough to know when something fails thats the way i treat my community hey mccarthy shut up honestly sorry im getting really tired of people coming here its the same like i said the same thing with broughy when i first started streaming that first like three months my streams were just broughy jokes over again as i tried to make my own thing it s uhh it s pretty tilting yeah much better demetrius thank you and i know hes another runner but its just oh god it s so annoying man i m legit tired of it i work very hard to uh finish runs and the completion is inaudible might finish city section you know this runs dead as heck were not talking bad about the other speedrunner thats its fine michiganman its its its fine were okay right now thank you but yeah it s a medium point you know i was saying earlier like some people enjoy watching someone get really mad about the game watching someone fail over and over again that thats just not the kind of entertainment i like to have that does not entertain me therefore i cannot make it my own style of entertainment so run s dead baron you can t say run s dead darkviper says run s dead so okay heres the one thing first of all the guy whos trying to spam me first of all i get to almost times the views on youtube as this guy and im not shit talking to him at all im just im trying to make my own community hold on thank you im trying to make my own community so its actually him that is salty neither of us would really have to be salty about it neither he really is we re just different people however he does cultivate a type of viewer that does spam and cause stuff like that quite often in my youtube comments its really tiring because i know you guys are usually joking but my youtube comments are usually filled with really hateful people that really are you know they follow him blindly you know not blindly but just follow him directly so thats why on my youtub oh on twitch here i m im kind of trying to keep that away because just reminds me of the people on youtube doing it so yeah im specifically trying to stop people trashtalking him thats actually what ive been saying inform yourself in stop

get promptly deleted but this is the last thing we said to each other you keep having people say these things to you because you keep doing this and its him ranting raving about me to some fucking viewer the world doesnt revolve around you stop feeding your trolls and blaming me for it no one cares the world doesnt revolve around you i unfollowed you when we when you had that amazingly immature rant last time which is the one i just referenced i said another thing as well for the love of all that is good baron no one ever mentions you in chat other than to say you are streaming no one says anything negative ever no one in my comment section on youtube shit talks you and i read a goddamn large amount of the comments no one shit talks baron whenever anyone in the entire time that ive known him said something like i got banned in baron s chat than you probably fucking deserved it i ve never said a bad word about the man until today and i had every reason to so baron s response the world doesnt revolve around you either but your viewers seem to think so i constantly get hate from them my comments and my chat i dont know what happens in your chat or comments and dont care i was just addressing something going on in my chat at the time and had been taken out of context you can take it out of context a lot baron i dont care i dont care as i said i was calling out the people being idiots and asshats so we can move on from them sorry theyre coming from your chat but not my problem me and baron share like fifty percent of our audience so clearly baron hasnt gotten better even though he promised he would but ive kept my fucking silence for months but i keep getting sent these clips man he keeps being an asshole and im sick of it i dont like the guy i consider myself a truthful person i like to be honest about my feelings and perhaps it s your fault sometimes im like skirting around this issue i dont like baron he seems to be a terrible person like i had this clip go viral you may have seen it a lot of people saw it but of course you know whos the first person whos always tagged friendlybaron of course its just a small mistake of course friendlybaron will correct it no he never corrects it of course never someone else has to tag me and what does he say who am i oh that guy he tags speedruns the game the clip was taken from the speedrun the footage itself has been stolen from another speedrunners video and reupload without credit to anyone in the speedrun community this is my fucking clip i made this clip in the one video where i use someone elses footage it was credited to burhác but because im a content thief apparently according to baron he just runs around the internet lying about me he cant let things die eveneven on separate websites from twitch and youtube i have to be insulted by baron like with the comment here this person calling me toxic is fuck i have barons viewers criticizing me all the fucking time when i made my apology what were people writing there that im a fucking coward and i should apologize to baron cause he makes such better content than me i get this too but the difference between me and baron is i don t rant to his viewers on stream i dont rant at him on stream i dont send him fucking emails as well as the second time we had a bit of an argument was when save warping came into into play uh obviously the fastest strat did not disrupt the category so it should clearly be allowed so baron what s your reason why it should still remain to be banned even though it was banned under false pretences a year ago he said well it ruins the flow i mean the the the run that starts with an unskippable cutscene leads into a wait to remove the cops leads into a wait for lamar to walk slowly towards you leads into a wait in chop for lamar to walk slow towards you like a run that has seven bathroom breaks ruins the flow just just having hospital warps recently that has you dying additionally and warping up that no complaints but save warping ruins the flow his next complaint oh i cant do it he fucks it up sometimes so clearly should be banned obviously absurd but worse he blamed me for it being allowed he made no attempts at all to convince anyone that it should remain banned but when it got unbanned from overwhelming majority of a vote it was my fault because i care about things enough to argue my positions but its just the long line of baron doing things that harm himself and blaming others for it he baits his trolls they make him rage he blames me for it all the fucking time how many months ago is this now and you still every fucking time some fucking snide fucking comment about me or fucking save warping what is this guys problem but im meant to sit in chat and be like oh yeahyeah baron is as i always had been saying hes a good guy man hes got that fucking good series you should watch his casual vs speedruns hes got a good breakboosting guide captioner nah this is inaudiblecaptioner matt wtf but i gotta i gotta be salty about this shit why why give respect to people who are inherently disrespectful baron and i have each partly been responsible for the others success for different reasons his success on youtube showed me that it was possible to get successful i saw him have a video take off and i was like oh thats possible and i double down my efforts i was already doing a lot of effort but trust me i doubled it down cared more about thumbnails and stuff because i knew it was possible and it helped me just leading by example the difference with baron though is you know where my hours of playing gta v has gone into largely optimizing classic how many times am i mentioned in casual vs speedrun thats my fucking run ive looked in every fucking crevice of that fucking game for new strats someone finds some strat idea ill test it through the entire fucking game am i credited no im some other speedrunner of the time if i get credit at all can you imagine a person getting eight million views a month must get tens of thousands of comments over the course of a channel and somehow people who like my content are standing out like fucking sore thumbs causing him issues problems but if your thing is to attack me on stream can you imagine that from day fucking one ive had to hear baron whine about my very existence as if ive done something wrong for working on the gta v speedruns for four five fucking years now he s like why am i hearing about this darkviperau guy its fucking terrible sure im running the game that he spent like you know seven thousand hours for finding a route that he is in the largest part probably responsible for to this day cant he just fucking go away and let everything be about me friendly baron why did i apologize because this isnt your fucking problem this is a me issue i am a flawed human being that i cant rise above this shit i have other flaws as well some of them i even criticized baron for and i perhaps could be blamed at least somewhat as well i ruined a stream because i couldnt control myself one fucking day well okay its been many months but i mean another fucking day i am a strong proponent of what cannot be changed must be enjoyed nothing about my rants can change anything then some frustration but it makes things worse for myself i dont regret anything i said about baron but my viewers deserve better and i should work on more myself i should be stronger than this i should be above these kind of flaws in my personality but im not i am only human you have no concept of how galling it is to pretend to like a person whos been nothing but an asshole to you because you know your audience likes him cause he is very popular the youtube algorithm has made sure of that regardless of how good his content actually is please let me google what culture and find all the movies that inspired gta v to make myself a fuckin video its just gotten progressively and progressively harder to be nice about him and his content when i know for a fact he does not give me that same courtesy why am i making this video especially because i cant show all the other fucking clips because theyre not there anymore people seem to think that i owe baron an apology baron friendlyfriendly baron fuck no people seem to think i feel shame that i said these things about him no i feel shame that i wasted my viewers fuckin time and at showcase my flaws as a person that i cant rise above people like friendlybaron but the end of the day i would rather you know that i am a flawed person than to think for a moment that baron is actually a nice person he is not he fucking sucks,0.0

an angry rant fallout episode recap amp thoughts,recap and thoughts on episode the beginning have you watched it did you like it let me know in the comments below,i dont want to make this video oh this one i watched episode the beginning a few days ago i thought if i took a few days before talking about this one i would be less mad cuz i ended the episode really mad uh and there are still things that i liked about it and things i liked about the season overall that i still do want to talk about but this one i would say as usual no spoilers in the comment section but this was the last episode of the se season so spoilers away give me all your crazy theories before we get started digging into the last episode though i do want to clear up some things ive seen people saying about the show i think that we all watched the sim show and came away with some different interpretations so theres a few things that i want to get us on the same page about first before we dig into these things the first thing i want to talk about is the kids birthday party at the very beginning of episode i interpreted that scene to be that coupe has had a fall from grace and so as we were watching the show i was tr trying to figure out you know where did his money go why did he end up in that situation apparently some people watched that scene and did not think of it as a fall from grace but rather like you can hire a celebrity you know for the right price at any point like you could pay a band million and theyll come to your private birthday party and did not interpret that as like coupe was kind of desperate for money at this point some people also saw it and thought it was janies birthday party so i went back and i rewatched that part of episode one its definitely not janies birthday party coupe says in the very beginning hey birthday boy its clearly this boy birthday we also overhear two dads talking about why koop is doing birthday parties and they make it clear that he is desperate for the money for alimony for barb after their divorce which i honestly missed my very first watch through we get told right up front that he and barb have had a divorce the second misconception that i want to talk about is the date that shady sands fell so in previous episodes we saw lucy invol looking at the chalkboard with all the dates of all the events and we saw this one that said the fall of shady sands was was in and then an arrow to the bomb some people in my comments argu that thats not true that was the beginning of the fall and the bombs were ambiguously a few years later i really disagree with that interpretation and especially from what we learn in this episode that the fall of shady sands was not slowly over the period of many years it was a thriving society up until the fall that to me means was the year those bombs dropped we also dont see any other ambiguous dates on that blackboard and we know that most people in that vault are survivors from the fall of shady sand so they would know that is part of their history it would be super weird to have all these specific dates and specific years and then just trail off with i dont know and then some other stuff happened we also very importantly we know that lucys mom died in we know that from lucy herself when shes talking to the ghoul when they come across roger she says the plague of my mom starved so we know that is the year her mom died which we can piece together from what we learned in this episode is probably when her dad went and brought her back into the vault so is definitely when those bombs fell in shady sands not just the result of things happening in some other creators have pointed out that that date being the year that shady sanss gets blown up uh does put the in conflict with some lore from the games to be honest those are games that im less familiar with than fallout which probably means im due for a play through so maybe well do that as our next series after this one stay tuned the third thing that we need to clear up is ghouls having that supercharged healing ability that to me is such a deviation from what we see in the games and the amount of comments ive seen from other viewers is no its not like ghouls heal from radiation like thats a thing im sure it is a thing ghouls are ghouls are dead and i said that before and somebody corrected me i understand i understand that theyre like living but their flesh is dead they are described as post necrotic human beings like their flesh is dead we get that confirmed in the games whatever has happened to them they have gone into this state of radiosynthesis where their cells are feeding on radiation im not debating that i do think that is the case with ghouls i think that they can feed on radiation in the same way that people people can feed on normal food if i am getting shot at and fallout and i pause to eat a box of sugar bombs my hp will go up slightly i would argue that thats similar for ghouls healing with radiation if im shooting them they will take damage but they can heal with some radiation it does not mean that their cells can regenerate and repair their broken bloody foot stump like thats not a thing weve seen in games and to prove my point i went into game and decided to try and prove this one its not my play style at all so i didnt love doing this but for you guys this here you go okay i teleported myself to i picked captain zhao as our ghoul here just cuz i care about him the least im really not proud of what im about to do here uh but this is for science so im going to get just a regular pistol first uh and were just were going to shoot him in the leg and see if it regenerates yep see his health is not going back up and thats my point like in a regular situation a ghoul does not just super repair himself i do have a gamma gun so this is pure radiation and what some of you have been arguing is like well that is what would heal him okay so the right leg is what i hit so lets hit that with radiation that actually shouldnt have hurt him at all he used a stim pack okay so hes healing because of the stim pack that finished hes not healing more than that lets try hitting him with more radiation yeah thats i dont know what to tell you guys the ghouls in the games do not have the supercharged healing abilities that they have in the show thats just not what happens im sorry z um i am very confused about why the gimma gun actually did damage on a ghoul my best guess i think the gamma gun is mostly radiation damage but still has some ballistic damage and i think because i have all the perks for pistols that one really just did a lot more damage than it should have um but you could see like that supercharged tealing ability is just its not a thing and it really it really bothered me in the show because you you functionally made characters like coupe immortal like a whole town couldnt take him down and that thats its a dev its a deviation from the show and i know some people are tiptoeing around that its still fun to have in the show im not saying its not but its definitely different that ties into the fourth thing i want to talk about which is at the end of last episode we saw thus uh get shot in the neck start to heal and maximus says you know i think you might be a ghoul a lot of people it sounds like have interpreted that as its just maxs guess and he may actually reveal feel to be a super mutant like maybe he got infected with feev instead and thats whats causing the super healing i dont buy that theory i dont buy that theory because i think the change to ghouls being able to have this supercharged healing regeneration factor is a big enough deviation i dont think they can do that again for super im mutes i dont think that you can introduce this concept of ghouls to us where theyre functionally immortal nearly impossible to kill and immediately heal from any damage and do the same thing to super mutants like im mad enough that they did that to ghouls because again thats not how it works in games i would be i think i would stop watching if they were like also there are super mutants who also do this like thats not how super mutants work either some people said like max doesnt know what a ghoul is and while thats true like max and thaddius were both trained by the brotherhood remember we saw them in classes learning about things they definitely have also been trained on supermans on ghouls and im not saying that information is the most accurate its definitely biased and messed up if its coming through the brotherhood but they do both have reason to believe and agree that the supercharged healing factor is an attribute of ghouls not super mutants like when maximus said i think youre a ghoul if there was any reason to doubt that if there was any inconsistency in that logic thus would have called it out but he doesnt he agrees the other reason i dont buy that theory is because the show has not been using reveals based on knowledge from the games i thought thats what was going to happen i thought that was what was going to happen when thus and nittis came across the bear cave i thought that was going to be our deathclaw reveal and that would have been really cool for players of the games to be able to be like oh man thats a deathclaw and they didnt the show chose to make it a bear and still make that very palatable to a new audience which is a great choice like i think it it makes the show very accessible to people who havent played the games and if thats the way theyre going theyre not going to turn that on you and be like actually surprised its this other thing youve never heard of its a super mutant that we actually havent talked about at all up until this point and theres this thing called feev like the show hasnt really been doing that before i dont buy i dont buy the super mutant theory it would be cool but i dont think theyve given us enough foreshadowing of it to make that something that would realistically happen but coming back to the actual episode lets talk about what happened in that episode uh and ive been bouncing back and forth sometimes doing these reviews focusing on a specific character this one is crazy overlapping and bounces between all characters all the time so i think we should just talk about uh chronologically what happened in the show when it happened so episode we open on maximus who remember has stayed behind allowing thus to run away and lucy to take the actual head maximus has stayed behind with the decoy head to present to the brotherhood the brotherhood picks up max takes him back in a verte bird all the way back back to philly where the brotherhood is pretty much taken over the entire town maximus kneels to present the head to the elder and the elder immediately calls him out you are wearing the knights red and maximus has to admit yeah night titus is dead the brotherhood has this device to scan the head for the artifact and they can tell in seconds that the artifact is not in this head this isnt the real head they call him a liar and maximus is so quick to be like wait i can take you to the real head i cant tell what his goal is like i really cant tell is he genuinely like flipping on lucy that fast or is he just trying to buy time i think hes just trying to buy time because that was this whole plan anyway was just to take the brotherhood off the scent for a little bit regardless the brotherhood does not buy it they call him a liar and dane actually interrupts to say maximus is not a liar i am responsible for my own injury and side note im just loving that we have dane again i think that dane is just so gorgeous just a wonderfully attractive character um and im just really excited to see them again thats it elder quintis asks maximus you know how did n titus die and maximus says he died running which isnt technically true but i guess the gist of it is true like he did die as a coward like kind of shaming the brotherhoods beliefs and not being brave so true enough and this is where they really lose me because quintis he starts going on this rant about how power is taken not given we have to take more power and and you and i are going to start a new brotherhood hood im going to be the head and youre going to be the sword why in the world would he trust maximus at that point maximus has lied to him like multiple times like its clear that maximus is not a good soldier of the brotherhood hes not really tied to the mission he doesnt really want to be there he lied about the head he lied to buy time for his friends why in the world would anybody trust him like this has to be a trap but its kind of a stupid trap and i i dont like it we cut to lucy whos arriving at molds observatory and my first impression is that it looks like a thriving little community like you have crops there you have people farming you also have a very interesting ghoul in the background who weve got to talk about at some point right like what a cool looking character we jumped from lucy to prewar coupe who is driving barb to the office after bungling her oil change which we know is a lie he just wants to be close enough so he can spy on her with that weird spy device thing but askins shows up in a single mini car i dont know if you remember but in one of my earlier reviews i commented on how bummed i was that the cars in the set design of philly didnt include a neat little single person car model that we know from places in games like um starlight drivein in fallout we know in universe that they have these single person cars and we hadnt seen them until bud pulled up and i was just so delighted by that i really was absolutely tickle that they included it bud tells coupe about this program he has buds buds where he can you know continue to oversee projects for millennia which is foreshadowing what were going to learn about later cuz im hearing that and im like yeah that sounds like immortality right barb comments that her pit boy isnt working right like she can see the transmitter is on and im like girl you work for vault tech if you can see that your transmitter is on youve obviously been hacked like dont wear it into your very important meeting then you know what i mean like have some opsac here im also so annoyed at the range this transmitter has like c has to be right next door to be able to hear anything which sounds so low tech even though i understand that a lot of early spy devices did work that way if youre interested in that sort of thing at all look up the thing its at the spy museum in dc and i think its a fascinating piece of history but it was the spy transmitter device that to get information from it the people using it had to sit in their car like right outside of the embassy and so i understand that its not totally unrealistic that coupe would have to be inside vault tech to actually use this lisening device but is frustrating especially because it was given to him by moldaver who is arguably like so technologically far ahead of everybody else with her research that its frustrating that he has this piece of garbage tech to work with you know what i mean but hes forced inside for the plot anyway hopping back to lucy she finds mold and she finds her dad in a cage i dont know why i was surprised that he was in a cage i i guess i thought that hed be like working with molder not just kept prisoner i do like that that implies to us that molder was very confident that lucy was going to come after her which seems like it would have been a bigger gamble betting on a vault dweller to come into the wasteland but i think molda understands a lot more about humans than other people here seem to theres also a feral ghoul here who is very skeletal like very little skin left and i again i am so frustrated by the ghoul lore here like can they regenerate skin or they cant regenerate skin like is this the state that she was in when she died or i dont get it lucy gives moldaver the real head who removes the implant with a little drill thing and as moldaver is talking about who hank really is we cut to norm who is in vault the mechanical worrying we heard at the end of last episode is revealed to be a robo brain which the captions introduced this character as brain on a roomba which is delightful brain on a roomba is confused by norm first thinking its betty then hank then realizing no its somebody who shares of hanks dna realizing somebody unauthorized has gotten into the vault and comes at norm with a syringe but norm easily steps out of the way its very slapstick humor its very cute as thats happening we cut back to a meeting that is happening inside volac bud and barb are sitting just side by side at the table representing voltech and im confused i guess i thought that barb was a much lower level employee at voltech which she did lead us to believe but i think this is revealing to us that shes a lot higher up than we thought she was voltech is looking for funding so theyre meeting with all these big companies uh robco westtech big mountain theyre trying to convince them to invest in voltech and these other companies theyre not really confident in the vaults they start arguing they point out things like if people are left alive on the surface theyre going to kill the vault dwellers its never going to work but but assures them that the vault have the resources to survive for centuries as everybodys arguing we see this like shadowy figure walking around upstairs i have to assume that thats like whoever owns vault attch and is probably going to be a antagonist for us in season but regardless thats motivation for barb to sort of take focus of the meeting and as she does we cut back to norm norm continues to evade the brain on arba and he turns on the lights to see that the entire vault is filled with cryopods and i just want to point out what i said at the beginning of this the show has been very intentional about not doing reveals that would only be meaningful to people who have played the games like you could have just shown me a cryopod and i would have said oh cool cryopods like its from the intro of fallout but they foreshadowed that with the lab level on vault they had people in cryopods they talked about it we know that cryopods exist they foreshadowed that technology in a way that made that reveal also accessible to an audience who hadnt played the game so i thought that was interesting the brain on arba introduces the people in the cryopods as buds buds and we realize that the rooma brain is bud its honestly a fant fantastic reveal bud says it would have been insane to keep a failed nation alive so we kept vault tech alive instead and im like what like that doesnt that doesnt make any sense youre right it would have been insane to keep a failed nation alive like society evolves it is equally insane to try and keep a company alive arguably a failed company since they were so desperate for funding and then blew up the world like what the hell is he on back at the actual vault tech meeting barb says we have to hedge our bets you know but has this idea for three interconnected vault but we need your ideas we need more ideas shes encouraging them to bring the spirit of competition to the solution and i guess the idea here is theyre allowing each company to claim several of vaxs vaults so they can test their own ideas to create the perfect scenario for the perfect future of humanity with you know however many unethical things they need to do and in exchange for that these companies invest in vaac and that gives us a reveal of whats going on in and are just breeding pools for making families with the people from prewar from vaac in to create a generation of super managers people with positivity they continue to throw ideas at the wall things like we could intentionally overcrowd a vault so people compete which i think was a vault that we know exists canonically same with using a vault to develop a super soldier i think that was the fev experiment and they ask betty how can you guarantee results and she says this big dramatic reveal by dropping the bomb ourselves i said before i appreciated that the show was going in this direction with the vault tech did it angle and i still do appreciate that theyre doing that but i dont think this makes any sense for these companies to be motivated to invest in vault tech they need to see some kind of return and thats probably better done by like bribing somebody whos lobbying against the peace talks not blowing up the world but i will come back to this rant at the end and for now i will just say i love the way they portrayed robert house i thought that he looked exactly like i pictured him from the games and i really loved uh that part we then learn that the assistant that cp was talking to is betty and that henry is hank so hank and betty existed prewar in volac full circle reveal here we as the audience are learning this and its overcut with molder revealing basically the same thing to lucy and then farb does the iconic line war never changes she also goes on to say that friction and war only exist because society was created without guidance which im not buying it but well come back to that at the end we come back to maximus and the other soldiers in the brotherhood who are armoring up dne admits that they hurt themselves because they were scared of going out into the wilds and maximus admits that he is planning to leave for somewhere safe for a vault to be with lucy and dane says there is nowhere safe and there is no no leaving that line actually gave me chills like i loved it because we you know thought from the beginning of the first few episodes that dane was genuinely invested in the brotherhood was genuinely excited to be a squire and stuff and thats not true nobodys really happy to be there this is a high control cult and it sets us up for such a cool season honestly because i dont think max is getting out of this that easy back to mold we are finally getting roses backstory rose figured out something was up in the vault when she noticed that something was siphoning their water away she deduced that civilization had returned to society she was right shady sans existed she told hank and he said that was ridiculous rose ran away she left the vault she took lucy and she took norm and she took them to shady sands we get a very similar scene to the one that we did when lucy was remembering the feel of the sun and we get a zoomed out reveal that it was in fact the sun and again i think the show did a wonderful job of foreshadowing that that was going to happen it leaked just enough details to us that we could theorize what was happening and i said in my recap of that video i wouldnt be shocked if she was actually outside in this clip and then we got the reveal that she was actually outside in that clip hank came after them he took the kids and he destroyed the city and just referring back to what i said earlier this would have been when he took the kids back to the vault this would have been in because he would have told them like thats how their mother died through this plague so is definitely when the bombs dropped on shady sands i think this whole reveal this backstory being told by molder it is a really interesting way to explain a lot of backstory to somebody who doesnt know it while also showing us clips but having it explained i hate this reveal i hate this so much the fact that volac some years after the original bombs dropped still has access to live nuclear weapons it makes it it makes the game so unfair that it feels like its not even worth playing like if vtech has been not only functioning but still has access to bombs thats so overpowered it ruins a lot of the fun in game like for me the fun thing about voltech is that they were wrong like you can you get in the games that moment that planet of the apes you bastards blew it all up moment you can go into like the regional offices of voltech and you can laugh you can laugh about how wrong they were and how messed up they were and changing that backstory to be actually theyre still the ones pulling the strings it changes the entire feel of the game in a way that i really dislike and i will continue on that rant at the end cuz we have more episode to get through first remember a few episodes ago mold mentioned cold fusion we just didnt know what it was yet but she explains it is limit less clean energy we can build a new society with free power with medicine with everything that we need but of course vault tech made it proprietary so she needs hank to give her the access code so she can actually use it this whole time of course hank is begging lucy not to listen but she tells hank to give mold the code i wish that she had said more and i understand that we just got a bunch of exposition from molder we dont really need more characters explaining how they feel but i would have loved to hear from lucy how she i would have loved you know she has been such a talker this whole show you know she has tried to solve every problem with talking she has so much to say on whos a good person and whos not i would have loved i would have loved for her to confront her father and be like what you did was bad like were not the good guys if thats who vaac is i would have loved loved for her to say like muler is trying to make a safe place like why ar arent we supporting that and she doesnt she just says give her the code which hank does and im kind of like hold up you killed like people over this youre just going to like hand it over the code they show it to us on screen so i knew it had to mean something but i didnt recognize it off the top of my head its which is i did have to google this the original release date of the original fallout game october th so thats a really cool easter egg we come back to norm who still in vault for just a second and the brain roomba tells him you should wait this out in your dads pod theres no food here im not going to let you go theres no way youre getting out of this we also get to see the screen with the names of the people who have been defrosted and theres not that many of them which opens up some more questions for me that ill come back to at the end back to hank hes telling lucy i did what i had to do to save our people and as theyre talking the brotherhood arrives and it is gory the observatory shoots a missile out of verte bir and a scribe raight up falls and gets blended up by a vertebr propeller thats crazy hank tells lucy the surface is horrible people do horrible things to each other and he had to choose between their violent world and his peaceful one first of all you can never choose a type of people and second of all if youre bombing people you are the violent world the battle ensues it is incredibly incredibly gory and its done over the song i dont want to see tomorrow which i love when they do that they pair the slowmo gore with the s music its just so very fallout hank says something like if the problem with the world is factions fighting then the solution obviously is to get rid of the factions and hes just working off of so much misinformation that im pissed watching it like the problem with the world isnt that different groups of people exist like sorry again ill save my rants for the end the brotherhood continues just mowing people down maximus is actually fighting very bravely and then enter the ghoul remember coupe fought in the war in alaska he fought in power armor so he knows a lot about them and he knows how to beat them he takes out a brotherhood knight just oh its so satisfying that was a bad snap there we go max finds lucy and her dad and he shoots the lock off the door so he can let hank out lucy tells him hank was the one responsible for shady sands hank then puts on power armor and punches max in the head i hate this guy lucy pulls a gun on him and han is like you see what this place does like buddy its not the place its that youre a psychopath coupe interrupts and fires a shot at hank which grazes his cheek its revealed to us that coupe recognized the name mlan thats what he was tracking to get some answers about vaac he ask hank where is my family and hank flies away i dont know who coupe is asking about here cuz he was with his daughter the day the bombs dropped and he and barb were divorced at the time so thats still kind of an open question and one again that i will come back to after the episode summary we look at the aftermath of this battle and there is just so much blood and im asking myself like why did any of these people die like muler had this kind of selfsustaining settlement with people who were mostly farmers and people locally who had come to help because they believed in this vision why are they all dead like what was the point of that we know that the brotherhoods motivation has always been we have to collect this technology to save people from technology but they didnt really flesh that out and so this violence just seems very senseless like we really dont know why these faceless knights were just kind of charging in and mowing these people down and nothing about the aftermath feels deserved coupe says that war never changes but theres always someone behind the wheel and hes trying to find that someone he invites lucy to come with him and she picks up her gun and fires a shot its revealed that that shot was to put her mom out of her misery she tells the ghoul oky doi and follows him leaving an unconscious max behind max does wake up but hes alone and disoriented moldaver comes back in she activates the cold fusion and she takes a seat next to rose we see lights out in the city start to turn on like theres a whole power grid already connected and a whole city of housing out there that now has electricity moldaver says maybe you stop them maybe you cant maybe all you can do is try and its the first mantra in this show genuinely that ive believed in even a little bit she succumbs to her injuries while holding roses hand which are they a couple they thats a couple right like that they were together together dane comes in and sees that moldaver is dead and gives max credit for that death they all start chanting all hail night maximus and its creepy its culty and theres this deep sense of dread that like yeah max is not getting out the very last shot we get is of hank approaching somewhere to to be honest i dont recognize it and ive said in this video the show has been pretty good at setting us up to recognize these big reveals when they happen and so this one stumped me to be honest i had to google it the internet says that its the vegas skyline i dont know if i just didnt recognize that from the games or if its a thing im supposed to recognize from real life did you recognize the ending reveal of the city if you did if you didnt please let me know id love to know that i wasnt alone or if this is more common knowledge than i thought id love if that was just a gap in my knowledge and not a gap in the show and thats the end of the episode i have so many so many so many more questions and im kind of frustrated about the information we did get i still had so many questions about the enclave and to be honest i thought thats where hank was heading at the end of the episode and so seeing a different city skyline like confused me because remember the onclave i think is implied to be at the head of all of this because the doctor that escaped when he was talking to lucy he knew her full name and he knew her vault like he knew what was going on inside of it so i thought that the enclave was the one pulling the strings but that didnt seem to be the case i feel like they set up that part of the mystery and then just kind of forgot where they were going with it and now are just like well season is going to be in vegas unless the enclave is in vegas but thats not true right i also want more information about why and when vault was breached we know sometime after shady sands fell and rose mlan died or became this feral ghoul or whatever her state is we know that moldaver had her pit boy and used that pit boy to get into to be able to infiltrate to be able to get hank but i dont really understand the details of it because who cleaned up from the scene where theyre exploring in and we see the writing on the wall like we know its in at some point that vault must have discovered the experiment knew what was going on but couldnt do much about it and just collapsed from the infighting and stuff like that and then i mean did bud not know that because if that was my experiment like i would have done the resettling there and then i wouldnt have left that untouched for like years the fact that hank was willing to let lucy marry somebody from means that hank thought that vault was still fully functional and given that these vaults were meant to be breeding pools i dont think that lucys marriage would not have been oversaw by bud i think that bud would have picked somebody from for her to marry so to have it be feasible in any way that it was a raider who came out of because the va had been infiltrated like that seems like a plot hole to me that seems like a pretty big plot hole to me and who cleaned up the mess inside vault before betty organized the resettlement there like we saw on the screen of the people who had been defrosted of buds buds there are not that many people who are out and about theres nobody living in vault one thats there to go and help out and we know that theres nobody in at all because everybody in there is dead bud on a roomba is very clearly helpless like he got stuck just in some boxes in the hallway so he wasnt the one who helped which just leaves betty and i just do not buy that betty cleaned up all the dead bodies and repainted and set a bunch of new furniture in all by herself within a span of hours i dont know if thats a plot hole or just something they havent addressed i feel like its more a plot hole because theyve come full circle on the experiments that i feel like they think theyve answered all the questions here and i still have questions i also im sorry i just really dont buy that you can take these people from prewar and and put them in the cryopods and have them wake up to manage these vaults without them revealing themselves in any way like language language changes in the span of years these people would be so obviously out of place that people would pick up on it i also ive said before people just arent that good at keeping secrets truly like for stephanie to get married fall in love have a kid get remarried and not once not once slip up about the fact that her childhood was years ago i just dont buy it i was just i was frustrated by the vault stuff to have the ultimate enemy at the end of the day just be like peppy coworkers was depressing i work a to i live in this late stage capitalism that we all do right now im tired im tired of it when i play fallout it is to dance on the graves of the capitalists of vaac it is to play around in a world where working a to doesnt exist and i can build these little sediments and i can fantasize about wastelanders rebuilding society and i dont have to think about the stock market or profits or capitalism at all and to make it at the end of the day ooh just kidding it is still capitalism thats thats whats pulling the strings they want a market monopoly its a bummer and im not saying its not good storytelling or anything i think its well done i think its a neat direction to take the story im just tired ive worked with people like bud the nightmare of those people managing my life for years is genuinely a nightmare not some fallout escapist im shooting a deathclaw in the face nightmare but genuinely a to stress dream for me like thats less fun thats a lot less fun i also feel like it doesnt really make sense for these other companies like if theyre investing money in vault tech and they want a guaranteed return you would get that return from money and there wont be money if you destroy the entire world world like i feel like ensuring a return on their investments its more about delaying peace talks maybe upping the tensions maybe the resource wars its not destroying civilization so they can play out fantasies and vaults like thats thats essentially consenting to a future where youre just a robo brain and you dont hold any of the the power or money that you do because currency will cease to function the way that it does you have no longer you have no savings you have no place in the stock market you have no company anymore how how would that be worth investing in vault tech i also i just dont buy that that was the purpose of the vaults weve seen other theories before that the enclave was the one at the helm of all this and they were doing this to collect information on an unwilling population so they could use that information for things like generational space flight is the theory that ive heard the most that im personally the biggest fan of some of the vault experiments with the lens of were trying to compete with each other cuz capitalism its capitalism all the way down baby that doesnt make sense like we know we know a ton about vaults at this point we know a bunch of vaults that have canonically been in the game like we know about the vault where there was one guy and a bunch of puppets there is a chance that one guy and a bunch of puppets is going to be the one surviving at the end that is stupid there is there is no way that you can argue that the vaults were a bunch of companies competing to see who can last the longest when we have have vaults like one man and a bunch of puppets we have vaults where theres a thousand men and one woman thats not going to last longer than a generation and a thousand women and one man again thats just not that doesnt make sense as a survival experiment there are experiments like where they just purposely put people through undue stress to test the effects of stress theres the vault with the white noise to test the effects on aggression that just made people super aggressive there was vault with the rehab where they took a bunch of addicts and they put them in a vault and then they revealed after they were healed that theres actually chems in the vault and just experiments like that that are cruel for the sake of cruel to just perform experiments and collect data on unwitting people have nothing to do with companies competing to see who can create the perfect scenario for the future of humanity it doesnt work it doesnt make sense and they can sell one or two vaults like that and i get it i just dont i just dont buy it i just dont buy it and i just dont like it i dont like the reveal that like o vault techs the enemy and theyre so overpowered that they still have a live arsenal of nuclear weapons that ruins everything you know what i mean like it just its like recognizing that the enemy is so far overpowered compared to you that its not even worth fighting its just like okay you guys blow up up the world again okay it also doesnt make any sense to me if barb knew that they were dropping the bomb that she would at any point let her daughter out of her sight you know what i mean like even if she and coupe had gotten divorced at that point if she knew if she had any knowledge that the bombs were dropping on the day that they dropped she would not have let janie be outside with her dad like not close to getting into a vault i dont buy that for a second theres also vaults that we know canonically were unfinished like fallout had a lot of vaults that were unfinished that people did not get the alert to like properly staff them on time like the bombs dropping was a surprise to vault tech too and i know that barb saying they could drop the bombs themselves does not actually mean for sure that they dropped the bomb im sure that season is going to explore a lot more of from now to the moment the bombs actually dropped and a million things can happen in there i get it but i dont love whats happening beyond vault back im also not sure what to make of the brotherhood in this show i feel like they didnt flesh him out beyond a hyper high control religious cult i think and i never play as the brotherhood so im biased with this but my impression of the brotherhood has always been that you could make a real argument for what theyre doing you could make a real argument for technology was what went too far and if we can just protect humanity from that level of technological advancement we could save them like i do i think you have to give the brotherhood enough credit for them not to be laughable as a faction and i was surprised that they didnt do that here all the violence that the brotherhood did felt unjustified other things from the game that i missed in the show that i thought could have been cool easter eggs are things like perks like unless it went way over my head i didnt see any mention of perks or leveling up and i feel like that could have been cool in the show tops i saw were like other viewers making jokes like oh the ghoul has the bloody mess perk which i i love that i thought those comments people making jokes like that were so funny so clever i would have liked if the show had actually like leaned into that bobbleheads i would have loved to see like finding a bobblehead or leveling up in the show i would have loved if somebody at some point in the show was over encumbered i mean i guess the scribes are with their like giant bag things but again that feels more like a joke at how the brotherhood cant run things than actually like a to being over encumbered cuz you picked up that last piece of scrap death claws super mutants again correct me if im wrong but i dont think we saw either of those another thing that i really missed that i thought they really missed the opportunity for was charisma like showing how a different uh set of special stats is still like a valid playthrough and i feel like they could have done that pretty easily with lucy and im thinking specifically of the scene where she and maximus come across those two people that are like crossing the bridge and she tries to talk her way out of the situation shes trying to negotiate with them and i kind of thought that was going to work and what happens instead is maximus realizes they cant trust anybody and he reaches over and takes her gun and shoots them and its kind of this moment for lucy learning about the lawlessness of the wasteland like you always always have your gun always shoot first always fight and it it would have been such a cool moment instead to show that like a charisma heavy build is still a very valid way to to play this game its a valid approach to being in the wasteland if lucy had been talking to them and if it had worked like if you had heard that little ching sound that you do in the games when you pass a speech check and if then those other characters had been like okay we believe you well move safely and then they had crossed and then maximus had been like lucy like how did you do that and if she had been able to show him that like sometimes charisma is the answer it would have been really cool for us as the audience and for maximus to see that theres value in these charisma heavy builds that lucys trying to do but also it would have been really neat for lucys character to see early on that the people of the wasteland some of them can be talked to not all of them like theyre still canales they can still be awful they still could have been planning to kill her or whatever they needed to do it just would have been a neat moment of growth and a neat nod to the game and instead we got this show where the answer repeatedly and blun lly like absolutely hit in the face with it multiple times is violence is the answer here like absolutely its gore its leveling up and picking up your gun like thats the answer every time and i just dont buy that and if you follow me on here you know i dont buy that because i do my series of peaceful settlement builds thats how i like to play the game and i know thats not everybodys thing but i also think that there is value in high intelligence high charisma builds over strength and and i would been cool it would have been cool to see that in the game instead and i think the bridge scene would have been a really cool opportunity for it other open questions that i have here in general are how did molder get to the future if she didnt work for voltech how did she get there and how long has she been unfrozen and who unfroze her and why also why was the enclave doing experiments on purebred dogs the way they were like was that was there any point to that beyond just adding dog meet to the show or was that it and what happened to the broken water chip the water chip is destroyed the wall only has enough water to keep our population alive for two months like i know that was there as a nod to the games and thats cute and all but did it magically get fixed or what like it just it feels like it was such a throwaway line that im im bummed so thats thats where im at thats episode thats what i got i said in my last episode review the reason that i love fallout has never been for the main quests truly its not its always been for the world itself and with that lens i think this show is a delight and i had a good time and i love the soundtrack and i love the costumes and i i love the acting and i love so many characters in it and thats wonderful i just feel so frustrated but so much of the games is is that feeling of walking on the the corpse of the old world of the mistake and and feeling like you can rebuild it you can pick the faction to do it with you can try and save the world you can try and rebuild the wasteland from scratch and getting rid of that whole feeling for just kidding its capitalism all the way down it feels really icky and tiring to me in a way that i i cant quite put my fingers on cu its a good reveal right its a good twist like having hank the the good guy that lucys been chasing this whole episode be the one to have destroyed shady sands its its a good twist im not going to lie im not going to deny it but making vault tech overpowered enough to have pulled that off and still be the ones monitoring the vaults and and continuing this i felt bummed thats the best way i can put it season has been confirmed but i dont think we have any information yet about when that would come out so i have a lot of time to chew on these thoughts and i would love to also hear yours if you loved the reveal or you felt a similar way that i did please let me know if you enjoyed this video and if you watched all the way to the end thank you so much please consider liking it or subscribing to me if you enjoy my content i appreciate you guys so much i had so much fun watching this series and coming here to talk about it i really hope you enjoyed it too i will still be doing my regular fallout uh settlement build so go check out that playlist if you havent and i will see you later thanks again so much for joining me byebye,0.0

lets plays and gameplay walkthrough watchers do matter angry rant,this video is a reply to those self fulfilled narcissistic assholes who look down on others for not being able to afford a gaming pc or,recently i was randomly browsing twitter and i came across this tweet which said that people who watch lets play walkthroughs instead of playing the game by themselves shouldnt said anything about the games they watch on youtube in other words this almighty means that they should not be allowed to say anything about those games even if they are just criticizing the game on the basis of its story at first you may think that hes saying it respectfully but as soon as you will open the comment section you will find people on lets play viewers and looking down on them while these good for nothing socalled real gamers consider themselves as some sort of h beings just because they can afford a gaming pc or a console and lets play viewers cant so this video is a reply to those who look down on people who cant afford gaming pcs or consoles by saying stuff like that their opinion dont matter okay so first of all lets find out that can people who watch lets play walkthroughs on youtube give their opinion on the games they have watched instead of playing well yes they indeed can but it depends on the type of the game they are watching if they are watching a linear game then they are only allowed to criticize the games plot because since they havent experienced the game themselves so they are talking about the game play is irrelevant so in linear games case they can criticize the game on the basis of its story and characters only now if they are watching a souls like game or a rogue like game then also they can say stuff about those games but that will be different from that of linear games they can speak about the games character design sound design bosses and lore something similar is the case with horror survival games they are allowed to speak on story sound design and anime design game play is a common exceptional factor in all of these because since they havent played them personally then them saying anything about it is simply invalid but that doesnt means that they should completely be robbed from giving their opinion about any game and people like this idiot get mad whenever somebody says this to them they are privileged enough to buy a console or pc but since these cucks are so closeminded they think that everyone has access to gaming pcs and consoles the world is a big place and there are even people who due to their poor financial backgrounds barely get enough money for making their children study in a good school there are people who unfortunately have lost their everything due to natural disasters there are people who come from countries whose economic growth is poor people who lost their jobs in the time of pandemic so these people who have been unfortunate watch lets play videos of games on youtube because they are not financially stable so here is my question to this num skull and to dumbasses who have similar mentality like him are these unfortunate people who cant afford pc or console due to the circumstances but they still go on youtube to watch games because deep inside inside their hearts lies a strong passion and love for video games so people like these are not gamers huh tell me are they not gamers they arent just because they arent privileged like you hats huh even though they are unable to buy any console or pc yet they still love gaming and they show their love by watching walkthroughs on youtube but just because they lack privilege they get looked down upon if this is what gaming community means according to you then i spit on this community because who who made you idiots the messiah to snatch away the right to give opinion from walk through watchers are you the founders of gaming community or something huh i saw this stupid tweet about a week ago also and since then it is stuck in my head and has made me so frustrated and sad i was thinking all the time that how the hell they can hate people of their own community by treating them like inferior beings it disappointed me till a while which is why i decided to address this issue that just because you own a pco console and some people dont then you have no right to say to them that they cant speak anything about video games because the reason that it made me so angry was that i was someone who didnt had any pc or console and now i own a ps but i remember when i had nothing and lets plays taught me that what gaming is about it was youtube walkthroughs that made me passionate for gaming and if they never existed then i probably wouldnt have been what i am now and say goes for every gamer who wasnt born into a rich family lets play youtubers like mki and fire rat brat and thousands of youtubers are not stupid for making hours long videos they provide us playthroughs because they know that there are people in the world who are unable to purchase pcs and consoles they too wish that they had a pc or console but they cant buy them pcs and consoles so providing lets plays is the least they can do in order to ensure that those people too get the idea that what gaming is about but people like these demoralize them with their worthless gatekeeping and they start to feel inferior and they lose their motivation hence the gaming community loses a lot of future gamers who could have been shined in the industry but they are discouraged by these keyboard warriors fake gamers to all the lets play viewers dont give a about like these because all they can do is barking and and whining you are allowed to say whatever you want to say about any game as long as you are not speaking on its gameplay got it but make sure you fact check your points all right guys i hope you enjoyed this rent take care and byebye,0.0

how to write a critical literature review you must follow these steps,many students have been told the literature review for their dissertation is not critical enough and that their literature review is too,have you been told that your literature review is not critical enough has your tutor or supervisor mentioned that your review is too descriptive are you struggling to understand how to write a critical literature review if youve answered yes to any of these questions then this video is for you in todays video im going to explain what i call the intellectual ladder which is an intuitive and effective way of taking your literature review to a higher level ill start by explaining each level individually and ill apply each level to a case study so that you can learn about how the ladder applies in practice hi im miguel moital i am the founder and chief content developer of the dissertation academy and here in the academy we are all about bringing you unique tips and tools to help you write a better dissertation so if youre new here consider hitting that subscribe button writing is best seen as a multistage process whereby you first employ lower level skills followed by higher level skills and all researchers no matter the level of experience have to navigate through the ladder the ladder includes three steps description analysis and evaluation and the higher in the ladder you are the greater the intellectual skills that you are demonstrating you should see the ladder as a process or in other words as a sequence of activities with an order an order that needs to be followed in practice this means that in order to analyse you have to describe first and you cannot evaluate without first analysing in my experience of supervising and assessing hundreds of dissertations the biggest challenge for inexperienced researchers like dissertation students is moving from description to analysis why is that because if you do good analysis evaluation tends to come almost naturally and even experienced researchers have to follow the process however because they have the skills to climb up the ladder more quickly theyll do it faster they dont have to learn how to move from description to analysis to evaluation they kind of just have to do it in this tutorial im going to apply the steps in the intellectual ladder to literature reviews and im going to use an example of a literature review for a paper on the attributes of prestigious sports events that ive recently completed when designing the research we felt we needed to understand the attributes of sports events researched in previous studies so we went and looked at the literature with a view to identify what those attributes were and we did it for two reasons first because we wanted to understand the attributes and perspectives that had been used before and this in turn would allow us to assess the extent to which our own perspective which was from a prestige angle had been used by other researchers but we also thought more strategically we thought that by doing that it would allow us to discuss the results by comparing the list of existing attributes against the list of the attributes that we generated ourselves this in turn would allow us to provide evidence of the extent of contribution to knowledge if we use a different perspective from those employed by previous studies and in our case that perspective was prestige could we find some attributes of sports events not identified before time to understand what the three steps are about lets start with description so what is description about the purpose of a descriptive review is to identify relevant individual contributions so descriptive reviews adopt an author based approach and they list often in chronological order each of the main works individually as i often describe it its about saying that author said this author said that author said that and so on this is the most basic level but its a very important level and therefore you should spend some time describing a good literature review starts with a comprehensive description but bear in mind that description is not the end but a means to proceed to the next step analysis lets look at our case study on the attributes of prestigious sports events to see how description applies in practice so the initial task for us was to search for papers which had focused on the attributes of sports events and for each study we recorded several elements including two that im going to use in this tutorial the first one are the attributes themselves we wanted to understand what attributes those papers had considered and the second one is the overall perspective that informed the study and in that sense we wanted to compare their perspective with our perspective which is from a prestige point of view so lets look at the example of four of those papers to see how description works from the most recent to the older paper we have koeniglewis and colleagues from who looked at attributes from a service dominant logic perspective and identified four attributes yoshida and james from looked at attributes from a service quality perspective and considered two types of attributes service satisfaction and game satisfaction mccartney and ostis study was carried out from a cultural authenticity point of view and included four attributes finally ferreira and armstrong from looked at attributes from a service quality perspective and considered four types of attributes if we were to translate these findings into text this is what it would look like for each individual study we would be describing what was found and the perspective that was employed and if we bring together the four sentences this is what our paragraph looks like a sequence of sentences leading to no overall observation its a collection of individual facts with no logical conclusion its good but its not great so we need to do something with it we need to do something to make it great and what can we do to make it great we need to analyse these studies an analytical review moves away from an author structure to adopt a themed approach this means that you start looking at each individual author and focus your efforts on identifying key themes across them and the best evidence that the literature review is written at an analytical level is seeing statements supported by more than one reference if a statement is supported by two or more references it means that the researcher is most likely focusing on themes not individual contributions one of the most important skills during this step is categorization which is required to develop themes and why is that well when you are thinking across individual contributions you are deploying higher levels of intellectual skills its as simple as that if you look at contributions individually you are using certain intellectual skills but when you shift from individual authors to themes you step up that intellectual level and therefore you will be demonstrating higher intellectual skills time to see how this works in practice by looking at our case study again lets go back to the slide where we identify the attributes of sports events considered by four studies you may want to pause this tutorial now and spend a couple of minutes trying to identify common themes across these four studies if we look at the first bullet point of koeniglewis paper we can see that the same type of attributes was also covered by yoshida and james and also by ferreira and armstrong fair enough the names used in each paper are slightly different but the essence of the attributes is the same they all focus on the attributes related to the sporting side of the event the second bullet point of the first study off pitch service quality is a similar theme to that covered in the same two studies service satisfaction in yoshida and james study and staff attentiveness pregame and ingame entertainment and facility in ferreira and armstrongs study these attributes focus on the nongame attributes of the service so if we wanted to start writing the literature at the analytical level this is what it could look like for the purposes of our tutorial only four studies are shown but the vast majority of studies on the topic actually look at the attributes of sports events from a service quality perspective and therefore its appropriate to pick up this theme and mention it with regards to the attributes themselves you could start by saying that existing studies have considered two types of attributes core and peripheral these are the two themes that we picked up so far you could then elaborate on each one providing the necessary evidence to back up your claim in this instance you would refer to the various attributes related to onpitch performance game attractiveness and game satisfaction as examples of core service quality and attributes related to venue staff and additional entertainment as key elements of peripheral quality we have yet to categorise all the attributes in our initial list so lets look at the remaining ones the remaining two attributes from koeniglewis paper focus on the interaction between attendees and therefore they reflect the experience cocreation perspective adopted in the paper the four attributes from mccartney and ostis paper are of a different nature as they reflect the authenticity approach adopted by the authors so if we bring everything together into text this is what it could read like as you can see we are identifying key themes and patterns in the literature we have facts but we also draw conclusions based on those facts and that shows higher level intellectual skills by the way if youre liking this video give it a thumbs up as this will help youtube to recommend the video to other students and if youre not subscribed to the channel dont forget to hit that subscribe button and also the bell button so that you can be notified every time we release a new video developing a literature review at the analytical level already shows tremendous skills but you can take it further by reaching the highest level possible so what is evaluation in simple terms evaluation focuses on drawing conclusions about the merits and limitations of what we are analyzing the purpose of evaluation is to identify gaps strengths limitations or biases in the themes that you identified during the previous stage the analysis stage the particular argument sought in our case is to assess what areas have been covered by existing research on sports events attributes and we did so with the view to establish that our perspective has not been adopted in previous studies therefore the focus is on persuading the reader that our study which uses a prestige angle in the study of sports events attributes has not been done before and therefore we are covering a gap in the literature this is how writing the evaluative text could look like by starting with description moving forward to analysis and ending with evaluation we were able to make bold claims about the state of the literature and at the same time argue that our paper adopts a new perspective on the topic as seen in this part of the abstract of the paper i would love to hear about your experience of applying the ladder to your literature review so let me know in the comments what your analytical or evaluative paragraph is and explain how you arrived at it did you find the process easy did you have any challenges and if you had them how did you try to overcome them and if you have any questions about the ladder i would love to hear them and maybe ill do a video trying to explain it further more examples of the application of the intellectual ladder are available in the dissertation academys virtual tutor online resource a videobook based resource which also contains examples of how the ladder applies to presenting and discussing research results if you want to know more about how to write great dissertations tap the screen on your right hand side for more videos and check the description below for

called daggerheart its a fun and fresh update to the fantasy genre of rpgs and its been designed for longterm campaign play and character progression weve been working on it for a while and were super excited for you to check it out now about a year later we can finally put these claims to the test by playtesting daggerheart with the open beta ruleset open beta lets go betas and while i haven t had time yet for a long campaign i have had the chance to read play and run this game with my home group to see just how fun and fresh daggerheart actually is or isn t because i m bob this is where we learn how to have more fun playing rpgs together but this video will be a proper review not just the fun stuff real quick for full transparency even though i ll probably still end up with some comments calling me a shill for critical role now i was invited to and played in a private playtest session with some of daggerheart s designers before the open beta began i was invited to use closed beta playtest materials but i opted to not do that because i didn t want to sign the nda and i was offered this physical version of the open beta playtest materials which i obviously accepted importantly youtube guidelines consider this box as payment so you may have noticed a paid promotion sticker at the beginning of this video but there was no monetary payment no contract no nda and no conditions from darrington press about what i should or should not say they did tell me that they wanted people receiving the box to make some kind of daggerheart content within a couple weeks but i was already gonna do that editor bob ummm actually i looked at my emails with the pr person from darrington press and they only said we want you to share your open and honest ideas with us in the playtest survey on daggerheart dot com i totally misread that thought that it said like share your ideas with you audience and then i brought up the idea of like oh when should i make a video about this so the first elephant in the room i d like to address about daggerheart because i haven t seen any other reviews bring this up is why is critical role making this game at all not that art needs a reason to exist but art can be made for the wrong reasons and it s a little odd that critical role one of if not the main internet popculture face of dungeons dragons dungnzz an durrgons is making their own fantasy tabletop roleplaying game let s not forget the timing of this announcement only three months after dd s publisher wizards of the coast tried to change their game s licensing in such a way as to effectively cut off all other publishers from using dd material that they had previously been promised could be used indefinitely on the surface this timing makes daggerheart seem like an act of businessinsurance or you might say a roll made with fear but there s other evidence that this may have been a roll made with hope as in making the game for the correct reason for their fans to have fun with it the people at critical role and darrington press obviously love gaming play dungeons and dragons ddddnxzzz darrington press had already made several other games just not a ttrpg yet at least longer than page and they are not rushing it darrington press was the last of the major indie dd publishers to announce their own game they said they had already been working on it for a while weve been working on it for a while and were super excited for you to check it out and even if that part s not true they then continued to work on it in private playtests for a year until just recently releasing this open beta and they ve stated the final game won t be ready until about another year from now or longer so my first conclusion here on why daggerheart exists is had it not been for the dd licensing controversy of early critical role probably still would ve made their own ttrpg but i think it would ve been smaller more simple more original andor taken them several more years to actually do it compared to what we re seeing with daggerheart what we re seeing with daggerheart is not a small or simple ttrpg call me a lazy dm and i kind of am but when i saw pdfs in the open beta playtest pack one of them coming in at pages i almost checked out right there because that bulk of material especially for getting into a new game is not fun for me it s intimidating yeah dd e s core rules are over pages but the starter set rules are more than enough for me as a gm dungeon crawl classics is over pages but the page quick start has it covered and i liked the core so much that i cut it down into my own personal booklet version and shadowdark a new favorite of mine is about pages but the book is only digestsize has bigger font than usual and has very concise writing so altogether it s way easier to read and reference than any of these other fantasy ttrpg rulebooks and pdfs as a brief aside that s why i m writing my first book to be compatible with dd e and shadowdark and low key part of me wants to make it compatible with daggerheart because daggerheart in its current state is completely missing what this book offers it s called delve how to build and survive deadly dungeons it s going to have theory and advice for both creating and navigating dungeon environments similar guidelines and new rules for traps hazards and puzzles and a bunch of dungeons and traps to plug right into your game it s gonna have player options like new races and new e subclasses geared toward indoor exploration and new shadowdark talent tables and i couldn t do all this without my partners at eventyr games who have already published several successful e books through kickstarter because they re hooking us up with dice with trap cards and cards for the dozens of new monsters in the book some being designed by your favorite youtube creators like ginny di pointy hat professor dm and more and if you want to get some special holographic monster cards you want to sign up through the link below to be notified when delve goes live on kickstarter soooon anyway despite the daggerheart open beta playtest containing over total pages of material this reviewer box contained a much smaller pack with exactly what i needed pagers on character creation basic rules and equipment a sample adventure pregenerated characters and cards so i didn t have to print them all out i just wish more people had access to the materials organized in this way because it s much easier to flip through and get to the fun part but before i talk about the fun and less fun parts of my home group s session we should address the other elephant in the daggerheart room our other big claim and question is it fresh let s begin with a flashback august polygon publishes an article daggerheart the critical role publisher s answer to dd feels indistinct subtitle who asked for another medieval if you squint ttrpg and at the time i was pretty unhappy with this description today i still don t love it i still think it s kinda unfair but i understand exactly where they re coming from dd e s core rule is d roll high adding strength dexterity constitution wisdom intelligence charisma daggerheart s is d roll high adding strength agility finesse awareness knowledge presence lotta synonyms there but dd characters have a background species class subclass feats and they level up to unlock new abilities while daggerheart characters have a community ancestry class foundation subclass and domain abilities leveling up to unlock new ones okay well what about the base features of each character class in daggerheart the bard doesn t inspire their allies they rally the whole party but i really like the fact that it triggers based on the party s number of rolls with fear that s a smart adaptation to this ruleset the daggerheat druid does not wildshape oh no they beastform and they use templates for a few unique creatures which are easier to manage for players and gms than worrying about any creature s individual statblock plus these druids automatically get a minor feature that is identical to the e druid craft cantrip now the guardian class which i thought was exactly like a e cleric is actually almost exactly like the e barbarian not raging but becoming unstoppable to resist physical damage and boost their own damage the ranger s focus feature is pretty similar to the e hunter s mark spell that every e ranger should take and the daggerheart rogue has sneak attack straight up why would you do it any other way though the seraph class however which i thought was like the e paladin is quite unique they get a prayer die to reduce incoming damage boost their own rolls or give hope to their allies and it s pretty awesome the sorcerer automatically gets e detect magic and minor illusion and an interesting feature called channel raw power which lets them sacrifice a domain card for the day to gain some hope or boost their damage while the wizard gets prestidigitation and a seemingly very good feature for gaining hope or clearing stress automatically on at least out of every rolls if i did the math right and the warrior is probably my favorite daggerheart class alongside the seraph because like in dcc and shadowdark it leans into the fiction of letting this martial master perform fun stunts nonetheless you don t even need to squint to see that these classes are generally speaking conversions of dd e classes to daggerheart much more than they are fresh takes on fantasy archetypes now i m gonna talk about the good and the bad of what that really means but first i want to walk through the features of daggerheart s ancestries because while their aesthetics are mostly similar e the features do feel more original to me clank aka warforged gets an extra to one experience and that one is pretty similar daemon aka tiefling gets advantage to intimidate nondaemons and they can choose to mark stress instead of giving the gm fear cool drakona aka dragonborn gets an elemental breath and yeah that s also the same but it s the coolest thing a dragon character can do so why would you do it any other way dwarves aka dwarves can spend hope to resist damage nice elves still have a trance feature but it does something cool by making it easier to clear stress and hit points when you rest faeries are a fun new addition that can mark stress to fly or make a reroll of the duality dice fauns aka satyrs give the gm fear to make a headbutt and first impression i feel like that s kinda expensive because most of these features only cost stress not fear but idk fungril are another fun addition pun intended with a super flavorful feature to access their fungi hivemind of information thats super neat galapa aka tortle gets a shell that boosts their armor which is the same as e but also intuitive giant aka goliath get extra hit points and further reach in combat which is awesome goblins can spend stress to make the gm reroll an attack cool halflings give everyone in the party extra hope very lotr but also dcc where they get extra luck and they can reroll s like in e humans can spend hope to reroll when they used an experience katari aka tabaxi can mark stress to reroll their hope die still goin orcs seem super tough because ⅓ times they try to reduce incoming damage with armor they don t have to actually mark armor ribbets aka the best guys ever can breathe underwater and use their tongue to grab things or attack by marking stress finally simiah the little monkey guys have advantage on rolls to balance and climb so the core roll the stats the classes and ancestries are they fun yes definitely are they fresh nooo man like they re very familiar do note that there are more unique features in the subclasses and domain cards which you get all at level so your character can do more right away and be highly customized but i m not gonna go through all those cards too and how about the rest of daggerheart s core rules you have these duality dice for hope and fear generating resources for the players or the gm on every roll you have freeform improvisational turn order which we ll talk about in my session overview and you have other resources like stress and armor slots to avoid damage there s custom skills and custom paths for leveling up there s combo tagteam moves that i really like destroys nature but even with these fresh mechanics daggerheart s personality and the inherent setting that comes out of these rules is almost the exact same flavor of high fantasy as forgotten realms fifth edition dd like the two differences i can clearly see are where dd uses a hard magic system magic is wellstudied and calculable daggerheart is specifically going for a soft magic system where it s more mysterious like the force in star wars bending in avatar and i like all that and daggerheart leans heavily into drama surprise surprise for example the character background questions and connections all include one or more prompts about near death experiences and betrayal and hidden love and this is at level so overall superficially and in the first layer or so of mechanics daggerheart is a lot like dd e and i think this is both good and bad the bad i completely understand why people wanted something more fresh from critical role darrington press is not just another indie game studio they re backed by a multi million dollar media company critical role the babbles of mad geniuses still even with all that investment i think it was silly to expect darrington press to deviate from what the fans of critical role know and love in other words i think it was perfectly logical for critical role to model the feeling of their ttrpg on dd and the wonderfully dramatic performances of their cast and here s the really good part about that i think daggerheart being like dd e could boost the entire indie ttrpg industry and i ll tell ya why the majority of people who have ever played a tabletop roleplaying game have only ever played dd e but now that the internet pop culture face of dd e is making a new game that is still perfectly palatable to their huge audience daggerheart is likely to become the biggest and best bridge the pipeline the link we ve been missing from those players saying why would i play something besides dd to saying train noises dang it this train is ruining my bit those people who have never and probably would never play another game are now going to try their first other game and once you learn that next rpg its so much easier to learn any rpg and i think they will so maybe thats me like giving critical role a pass but i don t think daggerheart has to be fresh remember pathfinder e it just had to be familiar and fun alright now we re gonna round this out with whether or not my group thinks it s fun and whether or not i plan to run this game again the results might surprise you train noises you gotta be able to hear that train lol i recently ran the introductory playtest adventure the sablewood messengers for two players from my normal group both experienced with dd e and a handful of other rpgs because we play more than one game the adventure comes with pregens but we made custom characters by following the steps in the box and while there are a lot of steps both players reported that the process felt straightforward and hard to mess up not only because the steps made it very clear but they also praised the organization and visuals of the character sheet as well as the cards for being easy to pass around and then plop down next to their sheet and because they look really cool one player said that having a specific character sheet for each class is weird and i agree it means the gm or the player has to print out the specific sheets ahead of time but this approach does lend itself to better organization also from the sheets we all really liked the background and connection questions it was a fun and straightforward way to unite the party though i stand by my comments on these prompts being a bit too dramatic for my taste when every level character has a story of incredible loss but you don t have to use them all i guess and the moment youve been waiting for my players did come right out and say that combat with no initiative order was fine for two players but it would be tricky even in our full group of respectful players so not that people would be barking over each other but just that some kind of defined order is kinda better than nothing to my surprise my players also liked hp thresholds they admitted that it s an extra step compared to dd but liked being able to choose whether or not to spend armor to reduce the power of an incoming attack and blatantly they liked rolling more dice and getting big numbers even though you only end up taking or dealing to hit points of damage similarly they loved the bits as in the tokens you roll to represent modifiers the action tokens having minis on the table which we normally don t do and even things like filling in hit points and hope and armor slots on the character sheet it s much more visual and much less mathematical than dd but for me as the gm the bits specifically the action tokens and fear tokens were a mixed bag i liked the visuals and i was prepared enough that it felt easy to track these different bits making sure players gave a token on their turn or when they rolled fear exchanging action tokens for fear tokens spending both of them on different moves it was pretty fun for me because it was so gamified but all that accounting kept me busy on my turn and my thinking was more like how can i spend these bits to do something fun and cool instead of starting with a cool and fun idea then figuring out how to do it essentially it felt a little limiting to our typical rule of cool style also i was so focused on these tactile and visual elements that i wasn t imagining the game as clearly as usually do so i forgot to describe things during combat for a lot of my turns maybe with more practice that would be smoothed out for me but i have to tell you my best idea for some sweet merch that critical role can and should make for daggerheart before someone else does and this is gonna sound silly at first but hear me out instead of the action tracker card and otherwise just having like gems and coins scattered all over the table amongst our miniatures cards character sheets drinks snacks etc i would have loved to consolidate all those bits into a tiny abacus that stands on the table between the gm and one helpful player who can slide across action tokens when players act then i slide them back when i activate monsters it can have fear tokens for the gm and maybe even track hope on there too with different colors for different players i m calling it now someone will make that and it will make bank if daggerheart does well and that s my idea email me bobworldbuilder at gmail dot com we ll negotiate a modest royalty percentage winwin however the undeniable usefulness of that tiny abacus is also the quintessential example for why daggerheart might not be my thing at least as a game master i ve said it before i ll say it again for the last year or two i really prefer running games with as few things as possible between myself my players and our collective imagination for that same reason i really loved how the daggerheart rules and even the intro adventure push the gm to have the players add detail to the world i already do that all the time for npc names and combat descriptions but whenever i remember to open that up to scene descriptions and more it s fun and it all takes pressure off the gm while getting the players involved so i hope more people try it in whatever game you re playing not just daggerheart and for what it s worth both of my experienced players were like we want to play a whole campaign with this game though it probably helped that one of them crit like seven times in our hour session they literally rolled double s on the first roll of the game then they later rolled double s then double s before breaking that streak but still critting more it was super weird so all in all daggerheart is fun it s not very fresh but that has its perks and it s totally and utterly dungeonless so if you like cards and dungeons sign up through the link

how to write a critical review academic writing,this short video will help you to write a critical review critical response critique critical analysis it discusses the structure,music hello and welcome to this short presentation on how to write a critical review just before we begin there is a worksheet that accompanies this video so pause the video and download it now from the link below okay this video will really help you understand what a critical review is what you should include how to structure your review what questions you should ask and what language you can use to add effective cohesion and coherence i also include an example of criticality for you to analyze and then youll be ready to write a critical review on your own so lets start at the beginning and ask the question what is a critical review the best way to answer this question is to take two definitions from wellknown universities i suggest you pause this slide and read through these two definitions of a critical review and highlight any keywords you think may be important okay lets analyze these in the university of south hampton definition keywords could be a critical review has many different names its a detailed commentary and a critical evaluation and your aim is to question the information and opinions in the text in the monach university definition it states that it is not just a summary it is a thoughtful consideration of the validity and accuracy of the authors claims it considers the benefits and the limitations of the authors views so now we have an idea of what it is we can now look at a possible structure now there are many different ways to write a critical review and this is just one way a critical review should usually contain four parts these are an introduction a summary of the main ideas in evaluation and a conclusion so for say a w critical response you could have a four paragraph essay with each of these as separate sections like this but of course there are other structures like these where you combine the summary and the anal analysis together or you combine the conclusion and the evaluation together there are no rules and it depends on the essay brief or individual choice so lets imagine we use the four paragraph model structure here you can fill in the worksheet with these ideas we could structure our essay like this outline with these approximate word counts the introduction would be about and should identify the text and summarize the main issues raised by the author of the text the summary would be around and should analyze the key points made in the text here you may not be able to include all the points so you will have to be selective the evaluation should be a similar siz to the summary at around of the word count and should evaluate the validity of the evidence used in the text its important to point out that this should include the strengths and the limitations the final section should be the conclusion of about word counts this should restate or summarize your evaluation of the text and and make a judgment about the credibility of the overall claims made you should also make a recommendation on what is needed to improve the claims okay so what should i evaluate this is sometimes quite difficult for students to do as they feel they dont have the authority to do this so these questions can be a guide to what can be evaluated again here you can fill in your worksheet you can look at significance and contribution to the field these are things like what is the authors aim has this been achieved what does this text add to the body of knowledge this could be in terms of the theory or the data or the practical application you could also look at the methodology or approach the author has used what approach was used for the research for example quantitative or qualitative theoretical comparison case study etc how objective or biased is the approach an example would be how many people were interviewed what was the data and where did the data come from you can also look at argument and and use of evidence you can ask questions like what claims are being made is the argument consistent what kinds of evidence is used is this evidence valid and reliable so these are the types of areas you can evaluate the next step is what types of language or academic phrases can you use to write the evaluation section so look at these phrases on this slide pause the slide and decide whether these phrases are connected to strengths or limitations ive done the first two for you like this now you can use colors like me or just write s or l pause the slide and do the exercise okay here are the answers please pause the slide and check you can see there are a variety of phrases that can help to initiate your ideas cohesively right so we understand now what a critical review is how to structure a critical review what types of areas we can evaluate and what language we can use to connect our ideas we can now look at an example of a critical ical review this evaluation extract is taken from a ted talk by om man duni entitled how online marketplaces can help local economies not hurt them this is not a complete paragraph but is being used to demonstrate evaluative language in use here is the evaluation paragraph from a full critical review what id like you to do is analyze the paragraph and highlight the evaluative language in context the first phrase has been highlighted for you like this one of the strengths pause the slide and highlight other phrases connected to evaluation okay here are some of the possible phrases you could have highlighted the main limitation of the lecture is however lacking he fails several crucial questions left unanswered claims this unfounded assumption is biased falls short in convincing audiences that okay that thats the end of the video i hope its been helpful for developing your understanding of a critical review if you would like the whole lesson that includes more critical questioning evaluative phrases and the full critical response which includes an introduction a summary and a conclusion then please go here if youd like more lessons on critical thinking then please go here thank you for watching this video and until next time goodbye music,0.0
how to write a critical literature review for assessment report dissertation and phd thesis,how to write a critical literature review for assessment report dissertation and phd thesis,hello everyone welcome back to simplified research method series this is part three critical literature review how towrite a critical literature review in earlier part two parts part and part we talked about how to write your abstract introduction projectdefinition and the background of the study so this time we are going to talkabout how to write critical literature review so for a criticalliterature review you always search for the articles or documents or therelevant views based on the the title or based on your subject area after searching the documents you read the documents after reading you are supposed to code the documents coding for example whichever paragraphor whichever sentence is relevant for your argument you highlight that andmake a note of it so once you make a note of it after that you are going toparaphrase and after paraphrasing you supposed to cite citation the document or thesupposed to cite the argument with the authors name and the year of thepublication and after that you are going to check the document that for relevancethat the view you are talking about it is the same view that other authorshave given so lets talk about if for example you find three articles whichare irrelevant with your argument you are making so what you are going to dowith those three articles so lets say out of you search for articles out of three articles were the most appropriate or most relevant with theargument you are making on your literature review so this example is asimplified example what you are going to do in that so for article you are going to read it you are going to code you are going to make notesparaphrase check and cite same thing you are going to do for article you aregoing to read code note paraphrase check and cite and the same for articlethree so once you have paraphrased the views of these three authors from threedifferent articles you are going to do the cross analysis the crossanalysis between one and two to find out what article saysabout your argument and the views of article are similar or different so you will belooking at the similarity or the difference of opinions between the two authors thenthe same thing you are going to do between article and article orarticle or between author two and author so you are going to do the same thing you are going to read code note paraphrase check and cite and then you are going to do cross analysis between the two different views or two similarviews so as an example author of the article author one has talked aboutthat implementing lean in construction the process will improve the flow ofcommunication the article says that to improve the flow of communicationall the construction supply chain members or supply chain organizationsneed to come together and act on one goal which is the flow of communicationthen article also talked about yes the implementing lean would enhance or would advance the flow of communication in construction processesso in that article and article are giving the same view but article theauthor of article is giving you the additional information that implementingor implementing lean to advance the construction process not just requiredlean implementation but all these organizations involved in constructionsupply chain need to come together and that is the conclusion so you are goingto look at what article is talking about what article is talking aboutwhat article is talking about what are the similarities or what are thedifferences between them you can also criticize the article their methodologywhat are they method what was the limitation though howrelevant the findings from those articles are and then you are going tolook at the third one which is the article and article the reviewsbetween the article article so you are looking at three different views cross analysis between article article number one between article to anarticle is number or between article and article is number so or put itlike that a b and c so three different views three different analysis and thenyou are going to give a final which is the final analysis bit of all thesethree articles and discuss about the agreement or disagreement and thenconclude the main finding check and sight as well so this is how you aregoing to do critical literature review so you are looking at the differentarguments different views between the authors and then you coming up with yourown view so that makes it critical analysis but at the same time you cancriticize the limitations of those of the findings or maybe one of the articlearticle one is limited to within the west midland area its article twotalked about somewhere in saudi arabia article three is is the research aboutusa so in the usa now this is what theyre talking about in saudi arabiathis is what theyre talking about in west midland in the uk that is whattheyre talking about so you can do the analysis so what are the limitations nowthese three articles are from these from three different countries now you haveto look at your inclusion and exclusion criteria which articles you are going toinclude or which articles you are going to exclude for your analysis so ifyoure lets say if your research is restricted to west midland uk or isrestricted to england then you should be taking articles from england which orthe research which talks about the england or if youre taking articlesfrom any other country or any other and any other region then you should belooking for that the research has this similar environment oryou know the scope of the research is same as well but there arefew things which you can consider but that was a very simplified example ofwriting a critical literature review it becomes much more complicated when thenumbers of article increase but when you talk about at least one argument i wouldsuggest that you should take at least for three to five your you should readthree to five different articles or different books and come upwith one argument of one conclusion so thank you very much for watching thisvideo on next video we are going to talk about the case study analysis and thisis the series of simplified research method and thank you very much and seeyou soon,0.0
literature review critical analysis steps to do it well,critical analysis is essential in your literature review and there are things you need to do to do it properly ill be sharing my,critical analysis is not some great big secret to be more critical in your dissertation literature review you just need to do four things describe interpret evaluate and synthesize thats it its straightforward its simple now its not easy youre going to have to you know think about it but it is simple and it is straightforward you can learn it and im going to teach you how to do it in this video im dr elizabeth yardley and ive been helping students succeed with their dissertations for the last years critical analysis is always at the top of my list of things that people ask me about it never goes away and you know what some universities do not get any better at teaching it either hence this video before we dive in this video is the third in a four part series about habits that are ruining your dissertation literature review you might want to check out video one if youre a bit fixated on your word count because you need to stop that nonsense you might want to check out video two if you have got one big clunky mess of an unstructured literature review thats really not great but you can sort it out so do check those videos out ill link to them in the description right lets get into it youve got some literature that needs to go into your literature review and youre like what do i do with this youve read it you kind of get what its saying but in terms of being critical youre a bit hmm as i said at the beginning great critical analysis consists of four stages describe interpret evaluate and synthesize were going to look at each of them in turn right now oh yes we are first up you need to describe what youve read but keep it short and keep it concise there are two things you need to focus on firstly whats the item about secondly how is it relevant to what youre doing in your dissertation keep it laser focused on your actual dissertation topic or question you dont need an extensive synopsis of the whole item you dont need an extensive summary literally just one or two sentences say im a sociology student and im doing my dissertation on this question lets say ive come across this journal article which is super relevant for that topic what would i write for the describe part of my critical analysis i would write something like this the first sentence gives a quick overview of what the item is about the second one tells the reader how its relevant to my topic im going to put some prompts up on the screen now that are going to be helpful for you in describing items in your own literature review so take a screenshot because theyll be helpful if you get a little bit lost for words when youre thinking about what to write next up were looking at interpret the interpret stage of critical analysis goes beyond description its about application and implication to what extent can this be applied to your topic and your question what are its implications for your topic and your questions if we accept what its saying what does that mean for the topic were looking at what happens when we start to apply its ideas and its arguments to our topic lets take a look at the same example again so this is our dissertation title and this is the article were looking at okay so we are looking at tik tok but this article has looked at twitter there are some key differences between those platforms and will need to consider whether and how thats going to affect the relevance of its findings to our study also were looking at social media managers and the article is looking at chief marketing officers those are different jobs cmos are more senior than social media managers and their jobs have a broader scope are their general motives for using social media going to be different as a result do they have to be more careful about what they post are there likely to be more eyes on their content what impact will that have what can we learn from this study can we really apply it to our study also the people in this study use the same twitter account for their personal and professional stuff is that the case with the people were looking at are we looking at people who use the same tik tok account for work and personal life or is our focus on people who have two separate ones lastly what industries were these cmos in what particular sector did they come from how big were their businesses were they massive multinationals or were they small to medium enterprises what kind of companies are we looking at similar or different this phase of critical analysis is a really useful one for developing your own study further it forces you to ask questions about your own sample it can be really helpful for tightening up your own project because the kind of questions you ask at this stage naturally lead you down that road so weve got some things we can think about there yes this study is in the same ballpark as ours but there are some quite important differences so when we come to think about their findings in the context of our own topic we need to bear that stuff in mind this is a fair bit to think about there in terms of implications arent there here are some more prompts to help you when you start getting into your interpretation so screenshot these bad boys if youre finding the stuff that im sharing in this video helpful so far then please do take a moment to give it a cheeky like this helps me to see that the video is resonating with you youre actually finding it useful so that communicates to me that i should make more videos on this topic okay next up evaluate here were making a judgment about the value of this item for our research how helpful is it whats our assessment of it what has it added to our knowledge and our understanding for example this article talks about the proportion of tweets that are personal and the proportion of tweets that are professional so is balance something that we can explore is that a concept that we can take into our own research also the article talks about the notion of your own personal brand versus the brand of the organization you work for now thats quite interesting because it makes me think about the degree of conflict and consensus between the two perhaps thats something else that we can also take into our research and explore that a bit further you also need to consider things like the strengths and weaknesses of the article how convincing are the claims that it makes the quality of its arguments the strength of its evidence can it back up what its saying what are those claims based on in this article we know that its based on an analysis of x number of tweets over a time period of x from cmos who work in x industry and x number of interviews with cmos so we need to dig down into the specifics here and say okay heres the claim your article is making here is the evidence youve given to justify that can you make the leap from what you found to what youve concluded have you analyzed a sufficient number of tweets to make your data statistically significant what questions did you actually ask in the interviews how did you make sense of the qualitative data can we apply your findings across the board are they generalizable are

how to respond to critical reviews,peer review can be a stressful process for scientific authors how should you respond to reviewer criticisms what if a reviewer,recently a commenter asked about how to dealwith reviews of scientific papers especially overly negative ones this topic is important to the scientificwriter because how you respond to reviewer comments will influence not only the publicationof your paper but your emotional wellbeing as an author peer review is a necessary step in the processof getting your work published in a journal but many scientists dread this aspect of publishingbecause it can be stressful or even downright humiliating to be told by an anonymous reviewerthat your paper is not good enough a much better way to view reviews is to seethem as helpful because in most cases they are in fact mature authors relish critical commentsbecause they know it will improve their manuscripts in the long run how you respond to reviews is what is reallyimportant early in my career i took reviewer criticismspersonally and this emotional reaction hampered me in effectively addressing critical comments it also made the experience a lot more stressful over time though i began to see how reviewercomments even the most negative ones helped me see and correct weaknesses in my papers i eventually learned how to take criticismin stride and respond in a professional manner no matter how critical a reviewer might be a key part of a professional response involvespreparation of a reconciliation document to accompany the revised manuscript this document will provide an overview ofchanges that youve made plus a pointbypoint response to each and every comment by allreviewers such a document tells the editor that youcarefully considered and addressed each criticism and this aids the editor in making a finaldecision to accept your paper for publication by maintaining an unemotional tone you alsosend the message that youre a professional who is not flustered by criticism here are five suggestions to guide you inpreparing your response one a general rule of thumb is do not attack thereviewer or question their motives expertise or intellectual aptitude to assess your paper now i know that some reviewers can reallytry your patience and its difficult to hold your tongue but you must grit your teeth and be absolutelycourteous in your response and be humble enough to realize that theymay be right and you may be wrong particularly if two or more reviewers pointout the same problems and realize that if the reviewer failed tounderstand something it is most likely because you failed to explain it clearly and if the reviewer had a problem so willreaders apologize and say that youve rewritten thesection in question to make your point crystal clear now if a reviewer makes a rude or sarcasticcomment dont respond in kind that just shows youre as unprofessional asthe reviewer instead either ignore the comment or saythat you are not going to respond to personal attacks or unfounded statements if the reviewer says something really inappropriateyou can point it out to the editor in a separate message you may also get a reviewer who clearly isnot an expert in your field of study resist the temptation to point this out inyour response in fact comments from such reviewers areespecially useful because they tell you how to make your paper more accessible to a broaderscientific audiencesomething that journals want two respond to every point raised by reviewers failing to respond to a reviewers questionsends the message that you are trying to avoid addressing a particular point that the reviewerfelt was important instead list each reviewer comment or questionin your reconciliation document and provide a clear description of how you responded start off by indicating whether you agreewith the reviewer about the point or not then go into any necessary detail for example i agree that this sentence istoo long and confusing ive broken it into two sentences that conveythe information more clearly if you disagree with what the reviewer suggestsprovide a reasonable explanation as to why you did not make the suggested change sometimes this explanation requires additionalcitations or data to back up your viewpoint but dont stubbornly refuse to make any changesat all instead agree to as many as possible especiallyminor points so that you dont look obstinate when you disagree with the reviewer on moreimportant issues three show exactly how you revised the manuscript dont just say this point was addressed byrewriting the opening paragraph instead show both the original and revisedversions of the paragraph in question to make it easy for the editor to see how you dealtwith the criticism four if you are really stressed out by a reviewput it away for a while give yourself time to digest the review beforeattempting to respond if it makes you feel better vent your angerby first writing a scathing response after you get it off your chest then writea more professional version without the hysterics five thank the reviewers and show that you appreciatetheir efforts it doesnt hurt to be courteous to reviewerswho are after all volunteering their time the last thing you want to do is give theimpression that you dont appreciate their efforts you can make an overall statement of thanksat the beginning of your reconciliation document or add a few expressions of gratitude forindividual suggestions you might say something along the lines ofthanks for bringing this recent citation to my attention ive added a brief summary aboutthe findings as suggested or we did not explain this point very well inthe original manuscript and like the reviewers suggestion for improvement in summary part of becoming a successfuland happy scientific author is learning to effectively navigate the peer review process by following these few suggestions youllfind that your revised manuscript is more likely to be accepted by the journal andyoull find the whole process less stressful thanks for watching and let me know if youhave another writing topic youd like me to address,0.0

getting started with critical evaluation in your academic writing,in this video im going to give you some advice to get you started with critical evaluation in your academic writing the video,hi there in this video were going to have a look at the topic of critical evaluation so if youve received feedback on your essays to the effect of youre being too descriptive in your coverage or youre not evaluating the evidence you present then the contents of this video should be really helpful for you music so what do we mean by the term critical evaluation well i guess in essence critical evaluation just means not taking something that youre reading at face value lets consider how the term critical evaluation breaks down into its component parts when we use the term evaluate what we usually mean is look at the pros and cons of an argument when we use the term critical what we tend to mean is assess the strength of something which means acknowledging the positive aspects of that argument as well as the negative aspects or the drawbacks so when you combine critical and evaluation what youre effectively asking a person to do is look at the pros and cons of a particular argument or position and then evaluate the strengths of both of these sides of the argument when youre starting out with critical evaluation one of the things it can be really useful for you to know about is the concept of logical fallacies logical fallacies are simply common errors that people make when they think and reason the reason it can be useful for you to understand such common errors is that you can then spot them in the work of other authors and this gives you an initial basis to exercise your critical evaluation faculty one of the things you need to be aware of when you start thinking about critical evaluation is something we call an appeal to authority an appeal to authority occurs when you assume that the validity or the strength of an argument is invariably associated with the prestige or the authority of the person or publication making it of course this is an error because occasionally even the biggest experts on the topic will make mistakes or have an off day similarly publications even very prestigious publications will occasionally publish something that really doesnt stand up to scrutiny its easy to look at a very prestigious source such as the lancet which is an english medical journal and assume that because of the very prestige associated with that source anything they choose to publish must be effectively beyond reproach but thats simply not the case back in the lancet published an article which made a link between the mmr vaccine and the risk of the development of autism in children they subsequently retracted this article which you can see on the screen now when it came to light that the original research was deeply methodologically flawed and that the lead author had failed to disclose an important conflict of interest unfortunately by this point a good deal of damage had already been done because a proportion of the general public and the press had fallen prey to an appeal to authority theyd assumed that the original articles presence in a publication as prestigious as the lancet effectively meant it had been given an indelible rubber stamp concerning the validity of its findings and conclusions which of course wasnt the case at all something else you need to be aware of when youre thinking about critical evaluation is something we call ad hominem ad hominem is just a latin term that effectively means after the man and that almost needs a translation in itself what it means is when someone tries to discredit an argument not based on the logic of the argument but rather their perception of the characteristics of the person making the argument so heres an example of how the ad hominem logical fallacy might play out in text you might want to pause the video at this point to give you a chance to read the passage of text and spot where the ad hominem occurs press play when youre ready to continue well hopefully youve spotted here that this piece starts to go downhill after the word however where the author claims that because jones received an upheld allegation of misconduct in this should render his most recent contribution in unreliable but thats not the case at all if the argument that is that a piece of research or that a contribution is unreliable then the evidence for the fact that it is unreliable should come from an analysis of that contribution itself it should not come from condemning a person on the basis of their previous conduct or their previous contributions something else you should be aware of when youre thinking about critical evaluation is what we call the reversal of the burden of proof this occurs when someone says well my idea or theory must be correct because no one has yet proved it wrong now the problem with this line of thinking is that in academia if you make a claim or an assertion the onus is upon you to provide evidence that substantiates your claim thats how you effectively say that your claim is correct or valid just because someone hasnt yet come along to refute your claim doesnt mean that youre right so this is how the reversal of the burden of proof might play out in text you might want to pause the video here so you have a chance to read this passage of text and press play when youre ready to continue the reversal of the burden of proof is quite overt in this passage of text the author is claiming because theres an absence of studies that contradict the claims made by theory x that constitutes evidence of its validity but of course thats completely the wrong way around what they should be doing is looking for studies that back up or provide evidence or support the claims made by theory x one thing you want to be aware of when you are critically evaluating a source is the conflation of correlation with causation ie the assumption that the two terms are the same or interchangeable theyre most certainly not just because two things are correlated or associated does not mean that one causes the other so heres an example of the conflation of correlation with causation in this example the author has noted that a childs hand size is correlated with their handwriting quality in that the children with larger hands tend to exhibit neater handwriting but they then go on to make the mistake of assuming that the correlation will allow them to infer causality ie theyve assumed that because hand size correlates with handwriting hand size must cause differences in handwriting directly ie its a causal relationship but actually when you think about it hand size and handwriting are very likely to both be independently correlated with other important factors such as the childs age their educational level and the amount of practice they have in the process of handwriting you cant infer causation from correlation if you want to establish causation you need to do an experiment in which you manipulate one variable whilst holding the others as constant as possible and look at the effect that it has on the thing youre interested in measuring another thing you need to be aware of when youre critically evaluating a source is something called cherry picking cherry picking occurs when an author of a source selectively reviews literature or studies that agree with them and omits any studies or information that might disagree with them or refute what they are saying of course this is a problem because it creates a misleading impression about the consensus on that particular topic so heres what you need to watch out for with respect to cherrypicking data from reading the passage of text on the screen youd be forgiven for thinking that theory x had unanimous support within the literature but heres the thing what if the author has simply failed to mention a good number of other studies that refute theory x this is one reason why its important to read widely as part of your degree studies reading the work of multiple authors reduces the chance that you might get a skewed view of the consensus on a particular topic from one author who may have cherry picked the work that they included in their review of the literature knowing about the common errors people can make when they think and reason about a topic is really useful in getting you started with the process of critical evaluation however youll also want to know about ways you can start to systematically incorporate the process of critical evaluation into your thinking and your academic writing to this end it is often really helpful to think about three dimensions of critical evaluation the first dimension you might like to think about when youre engaging with the source critically is the perspective taken by that source first of all does the perspective make sense and secondly are there any alternative perspectives that also might make sense the second dimension you might like to think about when youre critically evaluating a source is evidence first of all is there any evidence for the claims an author is making secondly whats the quality of the evidence like and thirdly does the evidence support any interpretations that are being put forward by the author of the source the third dimension of critical evaluation that you might want to keep in mind are the implications of the source that youre reading so what do the findings or the take home message of that source mean in the wider context or the grander scheme of things is what follows from that source sensible and reasonable the next time youre evaluating a scholarly piece of work try and systematically think about the three dimensions of critical evaluation that ive just covered these will give you a framework that you can use to apply your subject specific knowledge in order to thoroughly critically evaluate that piece of scholarly work music,0.0

describing feel free to take a screenshot after weve described we interpret now interpretation is about applications and implications as were moving away from description and into interpretation we take the main points from the item that weve been reading and we think through the implications of them we think through the ramifications of applying them to the topic that were focusing on when you apply the key points to your essay to your dissertation chapter to your idea what are the ramifications of that can you apply those main arguments those main points to the thing that youre looking at or cant you are they not a particularly good fit with the thing that youre exploring to what extent can those points be applied to what youre looking at are they relevant are they helpful what happens when you apply these arguments to the thing that youre looking at if you accept those arguments what are the implications for the thing that youre exploring what happens who or what is affected who or what is included who or what is excluded what follows on from actually applying this to what youre exploring use sentences like these when youre interpreting and feel free to take a screenshot the next thing we do is evaluate which involves making a judgment about its value here were being really specific were thinking about the value we are evaluating based on how useful something is for what were doing were not evaluating in general were not considering in general how valuable this item of literature or whatever is in the grand scheme of things were thinking about how valuable it is for us and for what were doing so how valuable is a particular piece of literature for the questions that youre asking for the essay that youre writing for the dissertation that youre doing so were not thinking about how generally valuable a particular item of literature is in the broader field that youre studying in we are thinking about how useful how insightful how relevant it is for the thing that you are doing now you might have read one of the big deal books or journal articles in your discipline and you might think well that wasnt actually very helpful for what im doing thats fine that is a judgment that you can make because this again is not about the general value or the esteem or the profile of a particular piece of literature its about how valuable it is for you and for what you are doing evaluation make a judgment about its value in relation very specifically to the thing that youre doing and here are some sentences that you can use when youre evaluating after weve evaluated we need to synthesize and this involves looking at something in context when youve got a particular piece of literature you need to think about that piece of literature in relation to the other pieces of literature in that area where does it sit what does it bring to the party what does it agree with what does it disagree with does it highlight something that other pieces of literature have skipped over or not even mentioned does it say something completely new that you havent seen before use sentences like these when youre synthesizing so there you have it the four stages of critical analysis describe interpret evaluate and synthesize and dont forget if you want some additional help with your critical analysis skills download my critical analysis cheat sheet the link for the cheat sheet is

most disliked ign reviews penguinz,in this video penguinz takes a deep dive into the controversial world of ign reviews the video is not just about the disliked ign,have you seen the top most disliked ign reviews of all time that guy recommended me recently lets see im curious im going to take a couple guesses here on a few of them i think death loop is going to be on here well actually no this might be going in the opposite direction of giving low scores to great games okay if its that then the water one obviously thats thats a given what are some other like really alarming ones i actually cant think of any off the top of my head i can only think of extremely high scores to gain games that absolutely didnt deserve it i cant think of any low games to games that deserved higher video game journalists inscrutable folk but in many ways we should be thanking them because every now fighting amongst ourselves to call a brief tr congregate around the dislike button and fight back against a common enemy and with ig being the poster child for bad video game journalism i thought id create this list of the top most disliked ig reviews of all time time because what brings gamers together more than playing master thats what i like to hear love music you so coming in at number we have their review of call of duty black ops from sitting at a respectable dislikes why thats forign once again gave a call of duty game a stupidly high score of out of with zero cons if it has no cons why not give it a then see to be fair and i will never go to bat fory but to be fair just because theres no complaints doesnt mean the game is like a masterpiece or perfect like i i do disagree like if you cant think of anything negative then that means its perfect no it doesnt mean that like its its great at everything it does but it doesnt mean its like the perfect product everyones going to love a then see not only do we get angry when ign rate a game too low we get just as angry when they rate a game too high i remember black ops being franch like call of duty which releases the same boring game year after year and ign keeps giving them nines out of and what really pisses on our chips is when they rate games that are clearly more innovative original with better mechanics graphics and gameplay lower than the latest call of duty game so keep score in mind as we move on down the list i dont remember black ops well enough to know we their sonic unleashed review from dis the reviewer basically tears the game to shreds theres one thing you should know about sonic unleash before spending your hardearned money on it its a big piece of garbage big piece of garbage indeed its games like this that make reviewers rethink their lives now when it comes to sonic game its fine someone at sega hates the hedgehog with all his might and hes going about trying to sabotage the franchise with these awful games yet he still ends up somehow giving the game a he claims the jump button is unresponsive then proceeds to jump over the boost ramp to his death the jump button can be fatally unresponsive at times and its just a lot of trial and error gameplay that can get a little bit repetitive after a while and his hot take on why he shouldnt have to upgrade sonic speed is so fresh i mean really do i need to pay to upgrade sonic speed shouldnt sonic be as fast as it can be from the getgo isnt that the reason why i bought a sonic game in the first place oh and you can cleanse peoples souls by taking pictures of them im not even joking about that thats hype world video games why would taking a picture to cleanse someones soul be so farfetched i mean he knows hes playing a game in which hes controlling an anthropomorphic werewolf head jog doesnt day standard sonic unleash wasnt that bad gamers were just annoyed at another ign reviewer haphazardly reviewing a game they clearly had its not like an amazing game but its fine i i remember unleashed being okay like i didnt hate it sitting at a cozy dislikes their review of uncharted is at number eight so what will we angry about this time though its let down by a lack of imagination and some selfindulgence especially in a third act that drags on far too long and nine out of the dread did bloated third act you know a game thats not thats not even wrong i actually said something very similar back when i first beat this game that is very fair that is super fair like thats just uncharted fans being salty thats a very fair criticism is going to be good when ign give it a n out of and we still come after them with pitchforks oh i love us but ign have to meet us halfway they cant give black black ops a yeah if youre going to so this is i think this is fair it is a much better game than black ops for sure but i think they just grade it differently right like i i feel like its not farfetched to be like for a call of duty multiplayer shooter makes sense and then grade uncharted differently its two different people on two different very different games but yeah if youre going to compare direct scores then yeah its a little odd that uncharted would be lower than black ops black ops a no cons an uncharted and nine calling its third act bloated and saying it has a curious lack of imagination when the entirety of black ops is a bloated third act man this video is actually like the video is actually convincing me igns done an all right job with some of this ive been like a big ign and hate watcher for a minute but i completely agree with them on uncharted that is super fair criticism and black ops was good like its not the best is high but it was music good xenoblade chronicles definitive edition slashes its way into our number seven slot with dislikes now all the hallmarks of a classic bad ig review firstly the review contains a massive spoiler where they show without warning a late game unlockable character in the menu screen which would spoil the whole first half of the game now youd think ig would take the video down spoiler reupload instead they decided to leave this pinned comment in the comment section lazy bastards next the reviewer goes on to corelia one of the weaker characters from the main campaign a sentiment xenoblade fans strongly disagree with and then call the character dunban duncan this time however they did edit out out the mistake but even in the reedit he still pronounces the name wrong with a horrendous drop in audio quality which sounds like he did the voice edits on one of these bgz the story goes to some really really weird places that are as confusing as they are preposterous the coreno blade experience remains intact here lovable mead ry or the stoic and inscrutable dunon they call xenoblade chronicles definitive edition best version of z chronicles weve ever had giving it an out of which is a lower score they gave the original release and ds port work that one out dont know xeno blade no horse in that race well i know xeno blade i havent played it number six is their shin mami tense review dislikes and ig managed to piss everyone off within the first seconds of the review shin mami tensei feels like the edgier less sociable younger brother of persona the reviewer complains about how certain aspects a spin of shami which to shim mami tensei fans is the entire point its not so much a standalone review of shin mami tensei but more a video comparing two different series and taking marks off of one game because its not like the other where smt consistently fell short for me as a massive persona fan though was the writing it takes hours to find even having not played this game theres no point comparing it to completely and figuring out whats going on in contrast to which makes things personal right away i just couldnt shake the feeling that this was persona without the heart without the unforgettable companion characters the potent personal story the incredible soundtrack and the jawdropping twists and turns given the game and with the only negatives being that its not like persona is mental and fans of the shin mami tensei series were absolutely right to call this one out yeah i think thats probably fair if his main complaint was its not similar to persona then thats some dog are hotting up now doom blasts its way in at number five with a healthy dislikes wait what they give this a good about how doom feels to doom for some this is exactly what doom should be because it resembles the game of the same name but with all due respect those are desperately low expectations but it doesnt really distinguish itself by recreating yearold gameplay minutes and seconds is all the time he gives to reviewing dooms main campaign before moving on to the multiplayer multier bad fix power and shortcuts give experienced players who know the map and advantage no really do you mean to tell me that if players learn the maps and best weapon locations they have an advantage this makes the decision call of duty style leveling system that much stranger because gives experienced players another leg up with access to better weapons and more powerful demon runes so experienced players that put more time and effort into the multi its even a multiplayer genre its even a multiplayer genre i like but doom just did not do it well i was not a fan of the multiplayer and i was pretty excited for it i even played the beta or uh was it a beta what did they release was it a tech preview i dont remember now its been so many years but they released the multiplayer a bit early it just wasnt that good i wanted it to be good though but it was just yeah items youre blowing my mind ign blowing my mind so what was the verdict on one of the best shooters to have come out in the last years that is stinky out of it still meets what the wait what they gave it a seven yeah thats some trash the cons being loadouts and repetitive arenas so they must have graded it very harshly on the multiplayer thinking that doom was mainly a multiplayer title yikes was overrated man i couldnt disagree more i recently replayed that too that game is so good and is still good and the speedrun goes hard eternal is better but is still good out of it still meets the high bar call of duty fans expect amazingly we have a tie at our number four spot between between two different pokémon game reviews pokémon alpha sapphire omega ruby and pokémon sword and shield oh they gave sword a great sc dislikes and believe it or not sapphire ruby is probably the most infamous review on this list because it gave birth to the most popular ign meme too water its not a new complaint but the hoen region is still in balanced typewise heavily favoring water pokémon its especially noticeable in alpha sapphire since the villain team aqua uses a lot of water types it just feels like there are water pokémon in nearly every battle and i have an overleveled pikachu to show for it you also have to navigate many bodies of water which makes much of the late game incredibly tedious other than saying the game is too much water and too many hidden moves she doesnt seem to have anything else negative to say about the remaster i didnt play the rem as understanding and compassionate as they may be were just perplexed as to why having too much water would have such a heavy effect on the overall rating of the game which the reviewer gives a so politely picking up their pict that might be a fair overall the review a meme so powerful it now completely embodies the entire bad video game journalism topic right on to sword and shield same nostalgic this was bad called victim to getting stuck in the past it streamlines and fixes many of the series long running from excessive tutorials to the tum of navigating random encounters simply put sword and shield are the best pokemon games i have ever played and i play them all big words from ign there it seems that some people like this game and some people think its an absolute underwhelming letdown but its no question that everyone was expecting the second pokémon game home console to look much better than it did and include all preexisting pokémon which it didnt causing the whole game freak ced controversy when they said the reason why theyre not including all preexisting pokémon was because they were remaking character models and their animations not and the community ended up doing it for themes then a reddit post surfaced showing allegedly leaked data comparisons of sword and shield character models alongside character models from older games that seem to completely contradict what game freak had previously said aka game freak lied so i think were not just seeing people disagreeing with igns stupidly high score for another god yeah that i i still think sword and shield is by far the worst pokemon games like ever made and thats saying something when some when most of them for the last like years have been super lazy well thats thats not fair s too long the last like ish years have been super lazy sword and shield somehow is all the laziness youd expect from game freak and half the content as older titles its so bad i couldnt stand it i couldnt stand it i think i gave it a on the moist meter i cant quite recall but i i was really upset by it but also protest dislikes after feeling they had been lied to by the developers and ign hilariously getting caught in the crossfire got to love it hes a nelly all pokemon games have been the same for a decade they were for a while but they tried something to new with arus and while it wasnt like a full hit it wasnt a full miss either theyre going in the right direction i think rcus has good ideas that they need to flush out but for the first time in a long time game freaks finally trying something different like drastically different that is as opposed to just the same formula theyve worn out cruising its way into our number three slot is their review of days gone from with dislikes what did ign do now well first off this is the same reviewer that gave uncharted with its bloated third act a nine so she was already on the sony fanboy naughty dog list and boy howdy she pulls no punches here giving this game was trash onas as well days gone ultimately feels bloated goes on for an hour longer than it i know they made it better over time but this game in here somewhere you can feel it in the crunchy combat and when running from an enormous freaka hord some fine tuning and editing could have removed the tedm and highlighted what makes this game unique and interesting but days gone rides strictly down the middle of the dusty road and never finds its rhythm now the general consensus is that the game is pretty good and i think gamers felt the was unjustified and found some of the reviewers criticisms disingenuous like here for instance when she criticizes the bad writing which days gone insists on telling largely through tedious barely interactive flashbacks of him and his wife the dialogues pretty bad but only if you promise to ride me as much as you ride your bike on the face of it youd think the review god i forgot how stupid game was that line does seem really cringy but earlier on in the game deacons wife sarah specifically asked deacon not to say that line at their wedding only to surprise him by saying it herself the reviewer also hits us with it doesnt change anything its still stupid deacon can also unlock a slowmo ability early on which for biker but it allows you to relieve the pressure for a moment if you get overwhelmed its a game with guns what on earth is she blathering about why should riding a bike stop us from having a slow motion ability in our zombie shooting game because days gs missions suffer from repetition across the board whats that ien you dont like repetitive missions then why did you give the th assassins creed game a only months earlier see thats why this is what i thought the video would focus on they give extremely high scores to games that are just truly mediocre the ones the ones here is like offending fanboys of a title like days gone that game was absolutely miserable on launch it was so bad so bad like that her review is far more generous than i would have been its most disliked yeah i know i know but i i didnt realize it was just going to be these i i thought more people got mad about this as opposed to days gons not a its a seven what did i give it i couldnt finish it i couldnt finish days gone even moist meter it was too boring and bad and broken a lot of people forget how broken that game released i couldnt finish it i hated it i didnt even moist me to that give me one second though i got to pee real quick ill be right back all right im back theres the prime queen and caviar and the reub kelp in feno yeah another inconsistent ig review coupled with pissing off every sony fanboy again is why this review took the number three slot oh also one thing that i was thinking about while pissing i think ign could save themselves a lot of trouble and stop being such a remarkable punching bag if they would just get get rid of the pros and cons screen cuz they cant like actually convey their actual problems with a game through a con stre con screen of like five words so they need to just get rid of that they did oh did they nice unbelievably at number number two we have a threeway tie alien isolation death stranding and spongebob squarepants battle for bikini bottom rehydrated review all managed to achieve dislikes each and all three games couldnt be more different from one another which just showcases igns remarkable ability to enrage gamers regardless of what types of games they review at this point it actually starts to become impressive when i researching for this video watching one bad review after the other i looked a lot like music this but by the time i got to the end on finding out that theyd managed to reach dislikes on three separate occasions the agony and pure frustration started to melt away replaced by amazement and a cheerful bubbly lighthearted sense of child like wonder so how did ign manage to rack up dislikes across three reviews well a good start would be giving alien isolation a out of but when the genuine scares of being hunted by an unstoppable predator so diluted by repetition and padding isolation epic length really does work against thats real bad is going to make an incredible alien video game that checks every box but sadly isolate is not it needless to say gamers were outraged and judging by the comment section still are and rightly so its one of the most atmospheric tense yeah that is like actually one of the better horor games ever made even years after its release its still better than most if not all of the crappy horror shovelware games youll come across today and it didnt help that ign gave goat simulator an out of months earlier two wildly different reviewers and wildly different games in their scores that that thats that is an actual nothing burger but yeah this is a terrible terrible terrible review for alien isolation aable criticisms the reviewer makes is how he was killed even though he was motionless and out of sight fright dissolved into frustration as i got killed from behind for the eenth time even as i was crouched motionless and out of sight in an air duct but leaves out the fact that he was holding the motion sensor that alerts aliens to your position which the game makes perfectly clear and its just another case of ign getting the completely wrong person for the job a mistake they also made with their review of death stranding which they gave a certain landmark games in recent music years a little low but i agree i didnt really like death stranding i love the atmosphere i even liked a lot of the narrative as confusing convoluted and as it was i just thought the game overall was miserable miserable to play a game i will never ever even remotely consider touching again you gave it a i dont think i gave it a i thought i gave it a im going off memory i might have given it a i think i was in the to ballpark i cant fully recall its an absolute terrible game from a gameplay perspective there is nothing fun about it theres nothing enjoyable about about it and the tum isnt there as like a lesson or a deeper meaning its just tedium for the sake of tedium hated it hated the game playay legend of zelda breath of the wild and red dead redemption have managed to successfully tread the line between the rigidity of realism and the exhilaration of pure escapism death stranding possesses similarly lofty ambitions inventive ideas and a sprawling spectacular map but its all been settled on a backbone made of repetitive mission design and arduous traversal that simply cant one yummy in the prime tony this review apparently isnt for everyone perfectly balanced this man plays runescape and thinks death stranding is boring yeah but im under no delusion that runescape is fun at all its not maxing is one of the most miserable things ive ever done in my life i dont defend the runescape grind quite the opposite and now youre now youre really grasping it straws death stranding is straight up miserable to play you know in fact i compare it a lot to runescape tum for the sake of tedium grinding rune crafting i think ive spent the better part of like hours over the last two months on rune crafting and thats how it feels in dep stranding just point a to point b a million times traversing slowly maybe setting up your zip lines to make it a little bit quicker but not by much i set up an elaborate network of zip lines to try and make it quicker in my playthrough and it didnt improve at much its just miserable to play but there always was at least somewhat of a payoff with a really interesting world in story to it everyone and its definitely a game you have to be in the right mood and frame of mind to play which if you are theres no doubt youll find the score absolutely ridiculous and even if the games not for you im sure youd still be able to appreciate that death stranding is a truly unique aaa oneoff experience from one of gamings living legends hideo coima and lest we forget in the very same month in the very same year they gave pokémon sword and shield a out of okay last game in this threeway tie spongebob squarepants battle for bikini bottom rehydrated how is it even possible to get dislikes on your review of a remake of a yearold mediocre spongebob squarepants platformer that ps kids remember fondly well from what i can tell his main problem with the game is that it feels like a remake of a yearold mediocre spongebob squarepants platformer that ps kids remember exa what people want it doesnt feel as good as the crash and spyro i dont remember what he gave ited by some imaginative improvements but those few bright spots arent enough to bring battle for bikini bottoms passible but simplistic gameplay up to the standard of a platform that wasnt the point let alone impress like the spyro reignited trilogy all three playable characters spongebob thats a weird comparison cuz spyro just did exactly what spongebob that they just kept everything intact the thing is with spyro they just a better game so it ages a little bit better battle for bikini bottom still like just a fun old school nostalgic game though and patrick have the same repetitive few lines of dialogue that they bleed out after finding collectibles grabbing health or hitting enemies i feel like a new sponge oh sparkly i love opening presents by the th time i heard them i just wanted to stop playing he then goes on to call the remake of a yearold mediocre spongebob squarepants platform ps kids remember fondly get this to kid friendly battle for bikini b is an incredibly easy platformer with only a few truly challenging sections thrown in the difficulty jumping levels like spongebob may came in here expecting something such whiplash from the rest of the adventure and when theyre done the challenge reverts to being simplistic and kidfriendly for its final few challenges ultimately us gamers are always happy a game from our childhood gets a good remake which is what rehydrated is okay it doesnt add any bells and whistles but what did the reviewer expect them to do with battle for bikini bottom at a battle royale mode and the gamers that enjoyed this game as kids who probably just wanted to take a load off and rekindle their youth for a few hours didnt appreciate another disinterested monotone ign review thats so low for no reason that yeah that ones pretty bad rough its the big one the last of us part two is the most disliked ig review of all time coming double that of our number two games a hopping dislikes spoiler alert covering the buildup and leaks and the controversy around this game is is another video entirely but let me just cover the main kick in the balls the first game is one of the most loved and critically acclaimed games of all time masterp not just for its graphics and gameplay but for its storytelling dialogue and the relationship that develops between the two main characters joel and ellie and as the credits rolled on the first game the sevenyear long wait for the sequel began then about a month prior to the last of us twos release came the towering above the rest the le was a cut scene of joe in igns defense once again no matter what they would have given this game theyre if if you reviewed last of us too you were no matter what if you loved it you get if you hated it you get there has never been a more contentious title a more divisive title in the history of gaming there is not a single one that even comes close people feel very strongly on both sides so no matter what your opinion was going to to be incendiary the main character from the last of us getting his head caved in by an athletic woman with a golf club needless to say fans of the series was stunned not only did they have to deal with the main character of their favorite game getting killed off but they then had to continue playing the game as the random chick that killed him and so when ign said this this is a weird way of talking about it that i said this in my moist meter i feel like the game was out of order if they had done this sequence in a more i dont even know a better word but a more logical order i feel like it would have been much better received every beat that the story hits is a fine beat in a bad spot there was no reason to start with what happened im going to try and avoid spoilers cuz im sure theres still people that want to play it like there was absolutely no reason to start there and then make you like hate playing is that character the whole time it feels weird you had like if you didnt man this so hard to get the thoughts across without the spoilers point being they had a lot of moments that they could have put at the front and had a much more cohesive story that would be a lot more sensical for how it all plays out and it would have been a lot better received but they went like whole hog immediately no im not even just talking about the joel stuff getting into spoilers again they spend a lot of time with the joel and ellie flashbacks like sprinkled throughout randomly they could have front loed those flashbacks more towards the start before the joel death and it would have made a lot more sense as opposed to just going like full raw right away killing joel and they could have also built up the abby flashbacks a little more in the front and then work up to her revenge on joel as opposed to having it come out of the nowhere like a goddamn jump scare out of nowhere and then have you play as that character for hours they could have built it up and then you feel almost sympathetic playing as them as opposed to like trying and like force you down the line to feel connected they could have just done it in a better order and it would have been a much better experience and thats what i said in the moist meter too like it just felt out of order but while part two is a thrilling adventure it still makes time for a stunning nuance and fragility spirit the playstation has one of it finest exclusives in one of the generations best games personally i only liked the first game i mean it was brilliant dont get me wrong no need to dislike this video wouldnt that be ironic but once i finished it i didnt feel the need to ever play it again were not talking about beautiful joe here lets be real and whether or not the last of us part two deserves jo though of the most disliked ig review of all time is up for debate but whats not up for debate is the ign continue to be the worst source of video game reviews on the internet and im now i am very openly not an ign fan but there is much worse theres just straight up much worse immediately off top of mine polygon i dont think i have agreed with a polygon review yet theyre not the worst they are not good but they are not the worst and long may they rain thank you all for watching ive been the even like a legitimate this and let me know what i you off the most in the comments for me its greg millers review of zombie u but for now zombie u is a onedimensional whackamole title with some clever ideas that never really come together which lives in my head rentree anyway take it easy and remember never add too much water and as always aa lista baby things the res ability that was interesting i wouldnt have expected those to well some of those i would have expected to be on there i really thought more people got upset about the extremely high scores to undeserving titles but there was only two of those cases in there which is weird exa poopus and jd im surprised godan review wasnt in there its just not a huge title thats probably why its more of a cult classic kotaku got disbarred from video games after the ps review oh i forgot all about that actually thanks the reub homie and beetlejuice in streams and haley what was that im pretty sure i made a video on the old kotaku ps review didnt i here let me see this was this was going back where can i find like a more concise i dont want to just go to the actual review itself because its its a long review oh has no one done just like a full summation i mean i did make a video on it called horrible review of the ps im not just going to play my own video though but yeah i do vaguely remember most of that the reub slime the bits feno thanks for the resub poopy never forget halo never forget ign gave halo a yeah ive said this before ill say it again i truly dont believe any of these game outlets are paid off i think a lot of that comes from fear of the fans they know like theyll get eaten alive if theyre too harsh on a beloved title so they get very very is with it i dont think they get paid off they might i mean there there definitely is a world where thats a possibility i just dont think so i really think its more of just like the fear of being attacked by fans on twitter or some think the prime copper in the reub ev and the bits of bungy and star you should watch the black ops comparison between ps and ps the game was entirely different on ps so much so it was a literal scam and missing entire modes eek have i ever given a on the moist meter not yet theres a couple things i would have though if they came out today like breaking bad one week till it might change yeah elden ring wasnt far off god of war ragnarok who knows maybe that could be the first god of war was super close to just being a perfect game but the main drawback was just theres only like four enemies and theres i think three boss fights and everything else is just repeated so it gets extremely stale just fighting the same a million times and the pacing was a little odd but the game is super close so i know ragnarok fixes that they have actual boss battles they have actual enemy variety and i imagine the pacing is going to go hard considering where the leaves off so i mean there is a chance that could be its got all the pieces in place didnt you give rezo man no i love rezero though i didnt give it theres no anime id give not even my favorite one code guos man what the then you say minecraft would be if minecraft came out today id give it yeah that game is legitimately like loved by anyone of all ages and has unlimited content forever i couldnt think of a more perfect game even though im personally not a huge fan of it nope i did not tori upgrade was good though how do you still not like minecraft that seems impossible its not even that i dont like like minecraft i just dont get into it like when i play it on custom worlds with friends i enjoy it but like i dont play on my own you just havent been in the furry rp servers yet yeah maybe thats what im missing will you be playing sonic frontiers comes out the day before ragnarok so yeah im going to try and bust that out but the second ragnarok drops im absolutely swapping off sonic frontiers i think it was very stupid for the hedgehog to go up against kratos i dont know why they do that i dont know what the they were thinking there the bits of and ny i havent played a lot of bone lab but it seems cool like re sub sour a lot a bungi thanks the reub forx polygon gave dark souls a out of but gave dark souls a out of and called it the best souls game yeah thats polygon in a nutshell though like i i this may be conspiratorial but i believe it i think polygon doesnt even actually play the games they say what they think the fans want to hear i tr i i cannot think of a single review from polygon i have ever read where i was like yeah it makes sense i agree thanks for the bits feno whos the best game reviewer besides yourself whoever you like to watch i think game journal or i guess maybe not game journalism as a whole but game reviews are

establishes what theories exist the relationships between them and to what extent those theories have been investigated before you theoretical reviews can also help you determine what a lack of theories look like in your field or even the inadequacy of current theories the theoretical review also highlights the need for new hypotheses to be tested thus helping to justify your particular research project the methodological review focuses not on what someone said the findings but how they came about to say what they said the methods of analysis they used these types of reviews help to

directly to changes in practice and policy there can be experimental and nonexperimental research and contribute directly to changes in practice and policy finally remember that a literature review

directors their previous works and previous filmmaker spictures as well as a deep understanding of different film genres and classics for each of them and filming techniques and modern trends though you can find a lot of reviews thatare made by ordinary movie fans and sometimes they can end up being more informative anduseful than a professional one the key to writing an outstanding movie reviewis understanding its purpose so keep your goals in mind while writing share some information about characters relations and events but don t tell the whole story reading the review shouldn t replace watching the film yet you are free to mention the most importantmoments or turning points that make the film worth watching analyze the film in general and in certainaspects such as the acting

get their personal opinion giving a too general opinion of the film remember that things are rarely unequivocal even if you don t like the content and qualityof the film don t forget to mention if the music was actually pretty good or ifone of the actors managed to portray a believable character lack of evidence presenting your opinion without any explanationwhy you think that way won t be

galatians a critical review part,the apostle paul taught a false gospel one that led believers to abandon the word of god in exchange for grace to paul the,boca ratov good morning welcome to a special aliyah this morning as were looking at part three of this critical look at the letter to the galatians the the treatise of pauls gospel the paul the gospel that paul had created and taught that was of course a false gospel and its not was not the gospel of messiah it was not the gospel of the apostles and by the way thats not my opinion what i just said right there were going to read today in the opening passage in the first verses of galatians were going to read some pretty startling um confessions uh of paul in which he admits that his gospel is a unique gospel uh its his very own and uh basically it does not have any corroboration from the the other the apostles which is astounding an astounding revelation uh to make um the reason im doing this this teaching uh because i i want to bring clarity uh to to this reality that uh one man has derailed um the gospel of messiah now listen as ive been saying uh i am taking paul for face value uh i understand the arguments that he was misunderstood or his his letters were altered um you know etc etc okay i i understand that im looking at this from the perspective of putting all those theories aside and just dealing with whats actually written what we have before us which is which is the only reality we have at the moment and based on that reality uh its its not at all a stretched imagination to suggest that paul has done immense damage to the actual body of messiah because as we talked about is that the gospel message of yeshua as i said yesterday is in complete alignment from the very first word of genesis to the very last word of of the gospel of john and the wheels dont fall off ever until you get to one mans epistles one mans letters and its only because of paul and paul only that today we have countless millions of people who have who live today and have lived who have been deterred from enjoying the the immense spiritual bliss uh freedom uh depth of the law of god the law of moses otherwise known as the word of god all because of this one man so if if if its if you detect in my tone a a level of animosity if if it feels that way i need you to understand that the only reason i feel that way is because of what i just said um i i im frustrated and have been for years that this is the case that i just wrote an article yesterday its on the its on the blog page which will be released soon that uh you can you can talk to people about the truth of gods word and its crystal clear until they get to paul and then all of a sudden people say but paul said and thats a problem now to be fair by the way good morning welcome please subscribe to our channel that would be great i would very much appreciate that uh please please be sure and like this video and share with all your friends we this is listen this well all the messages lp judaism are worthy to be shared but this is this is really one that could could save peoples lives but anyway as i was saying to be fair to paul there are times more than a few in which i read pauls writings and i agree with him on certain points but you see thats just the problem because he talks as one of the cliches that people use is a person can talk out of both sides of their mouth um and thats a problem because hell say hell say like for instance galatians is absolutely a polemic against the law of moses that is an absolute undeniable fact again again i want to say for the th time reading it at face value when you read galatians he is teaching against the law of moses okay so rabbi he just teach against the law okay heres the problem the law of moses is literally the first five books of the bible all of it every single word okay every single word of the first five books of the bible is the law of moses the law of moses is not the ten commandments so therefore to have a polemic against the law of moses is to have a polemic against genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy and more than that every single prophet who ever lived to include joking on the immerser for the christians who are watching me thats john the baptist all of them and you could you could throw yeshua in there as well as the ultimate prophet all of them taught israel to return to the law of moses every single one therefore galatians is a polemic against all of the prophets of the bible every single one this is a problem i said yesterday something that was rather profound not because i said it but because it is and that is that the people who are against paul were not nonbelievers isnt that astounding i need you to think about that the people that were in opposition to paul were not people who denied messiah that is incredible the people that were against him who opposed his gospel were people who believed in yeshua and were were have the had the ardent belief that what messiah or excuse me what paul was teaching was in error and contrary to the teachings of the messiah and the apostles and they were right again looking at it at face value they were right isnt it remarkable by the way that paul talks in his letters about the the onslaught of opposition he received but isnt it interesting that we dont have any written rebuttals from any of these opposers now thats very much not jewish because usually in judaism you have whats called a responsa meaning that if somebody says something about torah and they are wrong or whatever then a rabbi will sit down and write a response or will write its very common in fact epistles are common in judaism rom bond wrote an epistle uh the villagon wrote an epistle and theyre called epistles by the way there are many rabbis who have written letters theyre not considered word of the living god because thats rather vain to say the least but rabbis do ride epistles and they write responses and so the idea that you would have so many people opposed to paul and yet nobody writes a rebuttal im going to suggest and this is a complete conspiracy theory i have no evidence to back back it up but im gonna suggest on the mere fact on the sheer fact i should say that thats incredibly curious that there were probably responses but i would venture to guess that the church kind of you know kept those hidden away and i can imagine why im again i have no evidence they exist but im just supposing um i can imagine that they were full of of scriptural verses that utterly slaughtered uh pauls gospel as is easy to do its not at all difficult to do something else i found curious i went through pauls letters it just to me you know because i we we study um robinson and i we read daily devotionals uh written by dr rabbi dr twerski who is a psychiatrist and he talks a lot about um selfesteem issues and how that is societys number one problem and hes hes right by the way um but i found that in in light of that i thought it was interesting as i went through pauls letters i wish id never done this before but i thought you know what im just going to take a quick peek um paul there are letters some say because they include hebrews with that um but there are letters that are attributed to paul half of them are forgeries by the way theyre written in his name he didnt actually write them so people say that pauls letters are scripture because he wrote them because and the and that matters because hes the one who received the unique and special um joseph smith ellen g white like encounter with the messiah that no one else on the planet had ever had and as a result his writings are a holy word of god okay well what if he didnt write them are they still the holy word of god what if they were forgeries written in his name ah you see now thats true by the way scholars are unanimous that half of his letters that attributed to him are actually forgeries theyre pseudographical which is a a very fancy and scholarly way to say forgery and so in any case though whats interesting is you look at these out of the paul begins his letter by basically making a um basically saying that hes hes a true apostle called by god not of man uh i find that curious because the other apostles dont do that and it to me it reeks of somebody who has a uh uh a selfesteem problem if you have to run around every time you open your mouth you have to tell people youre called of god not of man but called of god i have the im called by the unique anointing of the most high man didnt call me god called me ladies and gentlemen i just want you to say put yourself in modern times and suppose that god forbid every time i got on this program god forbid i would say im a im a called of god uh not by man but my anointing comes from the most high alone would you think that i was a nutcase you should by the way please say yes um would you want to listen to me that should be a huge red flag okay uh as as it should be um so you know these are problems we have people dont look at them because people have been mentally conditioned to ignore the obvious we shouldnt ignore these red flags um and then we talk about i talk about joseph smith ellen g white you could say william miller um all all people who who began cults and we talk about those kind of people and we say oh man isnt it nuts that you would listen to some guy who said he had a private revelation from god uh all by himself in the desert and started a whole new religion and wrote an entire uh book that he claims to be the word of god isnt that just nuts that you would believe that and then we have paul who basically has the exact same story only in a different setting and we have no problem with it whatsoever this is why i want you to think this is why i urge you i beg you i implore you i get down on my hands and knees euphemistically and and and and and encourage you to use your critical thinking skills which of believers do not do theyre too busy drinking their coffee and eating their scone during the message to actually do any critical thinking so um in galatians the apostle paul talks about um that people have been let so easily led astray well why is his gospel so easily defeated and again i want to remind you i want to remind you and to me by the way to me i believe this is a huge statement so im going to say it again for like the third time and you tell me and i mean this every time i say you tell me i want you to tell me your opinion okay um the people that were opposing him the people that were leading people astray from his gospel were people who believed in yeshua who believed that the messiah was the messiah so why is it that people are so easily led astray from the gospel of paul well because its not scriptural it is terribly confused well let me give you an example so i said that sometimes i agree with paul and thats true there are sometimes that paul writes things like him right on thats thats true but the problem is is hes not consistent so you read galatians right its a hot mess written in about you know you could split the difference and say ce okay six or seven years later he writes romans six or seven years i want you to think about that because we we have to put things in timelines right so i already told you that if you were years old uh you know a week after the resurrection of messiah and you became a believer you would most likely be dead before you could ever get a hold of one of pauls letters right so so what do you do in the meantime whats your bible your bible is the tanakh which is by the way the law of moses but youre not supposed to be following the law of moses according to paul you see the problem here so if youre studying the law of moses you think you might be doing it yeah probably like all the other jews around you to include the apostles and messiahs example you know paul says at one point im not sure if this is one of his forged letters or not actually it is its ephesians which is a letter written in his name and he didnt actually write it but the people who were forging that letter and pretending that it was paul said follow me as i follow messiah the only problem is im not following messiah he he lived a certain way and im living the exact opposite way so follow me as i dont follow messiah do you see the confusion so in romans chapter paul says this which with with which i agree this is what he says those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on that which that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on that which the spirit desires the mind of sinful man is death but the mind control by the spirit is life and peace the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to gods torah nor can it do so those controlled by this sinful nature cannot please god so paul here is saying listen a sinful man doesnt want to follow the law of god he has his mind set on carnal things but the person is controlled by the spirit has his mind set on spiritual things and therefore that person will follow the law of god thats great i agree high five only problem is you turn around tell people to not circumcise their children you tell people not to keep the festivals you tell people dont live according to the law but wait why are you having to tell them not to do that because theyre reading it in the bible and theyre doing it so youre having to come along and tell the people who are being led by the spirit not to follow the spirit but in fact turn back to their carnal way of doing things which is in fact hostile to the law of god its a complete and utter confusion but its not just my opinion lets look at i told you i was going to get to this quote from um the encyclopedia judaica three um three highlighted sections here in case you happen to have the encyclopedia judaica you can find this in volume which volume is this volume we are in article in case you happen to have the encyclopedia deca volume it says here in the encyclopedia judaica pauls attitude towards the jewish law is extreme and cannot be explained as as stimming only from his theology of the cross for him the old mosaic covenant was a dispensation of death carved in letters on stone a dispensation of condemnation which has faded away in comparison with the new covenant which is the dispensation of the spirit for the law brings wrath but where there is no law there is no transgression ah so in romans he admits that sin is transgression of the law so the clear hellenistic paul by the way is a progressive liberal in his theology absolutely progressive liberal his his problem to sin is remove the law therefore there cant be sin problem solved ah there we go if we remove the commandments of god then we cant be sinning sounds logical problem you cant remove the law of god theres that but that was pauls solution pauls solution was you know the problem is were condemned to sin because of gods law we could try to stop sinning but you know what thats kind of a buzz kill so heres lets do this lets get rid of god because getting rid of gods law is tantamount to getting rid of god but well pretend were keeping him by saying were getting rid of him and living in grace you see so he goes on to say for him there is no essential difference between the days of the week and the different kinds of food it seems clear from all his assertions that pauls converse conversion meant for him liberation from the yoke of the jewish law the new covenant of christianity was freedom from the law now by the way this is not necessarily anything new there were plenty of jewish people who wanted to get free of the yoke of the jewish law because their natures were carnal paul would not be the first jew who wanted to be set free from the commandments of god so it says paul could not say in so many words that the jewish law had also ceased to have validity for jews converted to it says here christianity but well let that go not only because he maintained that he who accepts the validity the law and transgression is condemned and because he did not want to shame the weak brethren so if you actually follow the torah youre weak which by the way is the exact opposite of what we read in the actual bible what we what we read in the bible is that those who follow the law are the strong ones who killed goliath was it somebody who followed the law or somebody who didnt follow the law hmm so it says here but also because it was obviously unwise to provoke the wrath again im reading im just going to read it straight i dont agree with these terms but thats not the here nor there he paul did not in other words pauls paul did not outright say that jews should abandon the law because he didnt want to upset the mother church in jerusalem thats what the the encyclopedia is saying here he thought moreover that everyone should remain in the state in which he was called this is for first corinthians now i love that passage because as i mentioned i think it was in the first segment everybody likes to say that well if youre uncircumcised youre supposed to remain uncircumcised remain uncircumcised oh great so if youre single youre supposed to remade single also thats what he says there as well do you believe that nobody believes that its kind of like the call no man rabbi i never hear anybody say call no man father call no one teacher they never say that they just say call no man a rabbi its like you know stay in the remain in the state youre in if youre a gentile we made a gentile great what if youre single thats awkward we better not try to win did anybody ever try to reach out to single people well you know you you needed you need to tell them the good news the good news is if you become a believer in jesus christ when youre single youre going to be single for your entire life youre welcome so it says although for the purpose of winning over jews to the new faith he tended to become as jews so pauls a spiritual chameleon when hes around people who are secular he becomes secular when hes around people who are religious he becomes religious how many of you appreciate somebody like that how many of you appreciate a ministry leader who who conforms to whatever group hes around how many of you would say thats the guy i want to follow man i saw him at a party the other night he was wild dancing on the table tops as drunk as a skunk and then i saw him in the in the in in the congregation and the next week and boy he was so holy but i realized he was doing all that wild stuff just to reach people in the bar i really appreciate him how many of you would think thats great of course not of course not you think you right okay but yet we read this about paul i was when i was around jews im like a jew and im around gentiles im im like a gentile and we we applaud that and going that awesome thats so sweet says to the jews themselves it seemed that he was unwilling to fulfill the commandments of the law in his private life thats what is written here and its true that paul the truth truth be told that according to them paul was having was actually teaching against the law entirely and this is the problem i continue it says pauls numerous expressions of his attitude towards law could not be fully accepted by later believers since they imply opposition to all religious legal obligations hello by the way i got to thinking about this aspect based on what i just read there in other words pauls gospel initially was pretty much rejected thats very interesting it was ultimately rejected because it wasnt true you know how we know that now i havent really done a deep dive study on this but just to be fair but the council of nisea in ce pretty much proves that at least to a certain point because what happened at the council in essay on ce well at that council constantine in his cronies created christianity as we know it today and in so doing they formally and officially forbade any jewish practice by people who believed in the messiah which means that there were a significant number of people who believed in the messiah maybe not but at least a significant number who were still following the law of moses nearly years later and constantine and his church fathers uh quash that once and for all which means so if you follow the bouncing ball it means that pauls gospel failed until the roman monarch elevated it and made it made it the gospel now i want you to think about that let that sink in what i just said okay so it says here um um but although he was not the only early believer oh by abrogation of the jewish holaka paved the way for the separation from christianity from judaism so pauls it was pauls works and pauls works alone is saying here that paved the way for the establishment of a of a new religion called christianity that was separate from judaism remember originally for for nearly years the people that believed in yeshua just like jews consider themselves a sect of judaism that all ended with constantine so it says uh his arguments against the jewish way of life had a very strong impact upon the development of gentile christianity as the apostle to the gentiles and an opponent to the jewish religious way of life he aroused opposition from all groups of jewish christians who were united in their polemics against him isnt that amazing isnt that incredible what i just read now people can say and i completely understand and sometimes sympathize with their goal of making paul kosher the problem is youre up against a mountain because of what he wrote and and you could say well he didnt really mean it that way he he was plagiarized not plagiarize but you know whatever um i get it problem is we dont have you know were looking were still looking for the smoking gun let me read to you the first verses of galatians and then um i always always sit down here and i think that i have plenty of time to go over this stuff and i ive always seem like i run out of time maybe there needs to be a part four but anyway this is what galatians says and this is this is so problematic i want you to see if you can catch the red the red flags here okay um the laws of moses are barbaric the law of moses is the word of god okay im not even gonna pay attention to that right now its i dont have time for crazy um so listen paul an apostle sent not from men nor by man but by messiah yeshua and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brothers with me so paul starts out in verse that he wants to make it crystal clear that his he is a true apostle not by man not but not sent from man but sent by god what about kefa kefa is the chief apostle over the entire community and yeshua said that himself hmm he says to the congregations in galatia grace and peace to you from god the father and the lord messiah yeshua who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age according to the will of our god and father to whom to to whom be glory and honor forever and ever amen im astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you now the one who called them is him okay im astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you thats paul thats who hes talking about hes talking about himself by the grace of messiah and turning to a different gospel now i want you to pay attention here youre maybe youre reading this for the first time with a critical thinking hat on paul is telling them youre turning to a different gospel not my gospel somebody else has gospel what this is telling us is the people that are trying to convince them of something are people who also believe in messiah yeshua so thats a real interesting dynamic here theyre not these people are not trying to pull these people into darkness theyre trying to pull them into the truth of the real gospel and so paul throws down the ultimate fear tactic and im going to read this to you and i want you to think about this and im not trying to be i really am not trying to be egregiously unkind to paul but i want to make a statement here when im about to read to you is what any and every cult leader will tell people it is a the ultimate fear tactic okay you ready okay evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and trying to pervert the gospel of messiah but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one i preached to you let him be eternally condemned as we have already said so that now im saying if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than the one i gave you that you accepted let him be eternally condemned wow im not going to back this up by scripture oh no im just going to tell you that what im telling you is from god and if somebody else comes and teaches you something different even if its based on scripture you need to know that theyre going to be condemned to a fiery hell because they didnt listen to me can you say jim jones i mean that is this is the ultimate in fear and it still grips people today we have people commenting on this these last couple of videos that theyre still theyre still traumatized theyre trying to think of paul differently as they should but they still have this psychosis this trauma that if they dare think of him differently then theyre going to go right to hell so this is i dont know about you but when i read that again today i was like wow thats huge lets continue reading okay were not done it says and im not trying to win approval of men listen i want you to pay please i want you to put on your critical thinking cat i want you to cite all the red flags here thats red flag number one im not trying to win the approval of men red flag or or of god or am i trying to please men if i were still trying to please men i would not be a servant of messiah i want you to know brother is that the gospel i preached is not something that man made up i did not receive it from any man nor was i taught it rather i received it by revelation from messiah yeshua yikes yikes joseph smith hashtag lng white hashtag william miller yikes hes going to go on to say were going to read in a second he didnt consult with the apostles wow for you have heard of my previous way of life in judaism how intensely i persecuted the the believers of god and tried to destroy it i was advancing in judaism beyond many jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers um theres a problem right there guys this is um thats just the musar of that comment is so egregious you know im i was the best of the best and no one was better than me i was the head of my class i was actually all that and a couple of bags of chips and a large soda this is just so so not the way jewish people would dare talk about themselves but when god who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased to reveal his son in me so i might preach him among the gentiles i did not consult any man you know like cave or yaakov or yokonan or any of the apostles oh no nor did i go up to jerusalem to see those who were apostles before i was thats nice but i went immediately into to the arabia and then later returned to damascus there i was for three years i and and then i went up to jerusalem to get acquainted not to get instructions or to verify what i believe against what messiah actually taught but you know just to get acquainted with kefa and to stay with him for days i saw none of the other apostles because why bother i know more than they do um so i just met james the lords brother and i assure you before god that what im writing to you is no lie i have no doubt im sure it isnt a light ball is it just me or is everything i just read a huge red flag huge glaring red flag i go off into the desert i get this message that comes straight from god this new gospel and i dont test it amongst the twelve the people who were with messiah for three years who heard the gospel from his mouth you know we have the gospels but you got to know there was a lot more that yeshua said that we dont we dont have written down unfortunately the apostles were with messiah not paul the the were with him for days in his glorified body as he talked to them about the things of the kingdom of god before he made his ascension on the mount of olives did paul go there and say hey i just want to humbly meet with you because i had this encounter with yeshua and heres what i feel like he taught me to teach did he do that did he sit down with the leaders and say i just want some accountability here this is what ive i feel like god is telling me and i just you know what do you all think did he do that no no he didnt he went off and started teaching something that was actually different than what they taught end of our alia today i uh im gonna have one more session on this and the reason is because i do want to get to the comments from from mr lancaster because theyre also very telling i just ran out of time um so lets do that tomorrow and then well continue this conversation and tomorrow our focus will be on why telling gentiles not to go through conversion and live like jews is not only not scriptural not only does it not follow the pattern given to us over and over and over and over and over again on the tanakh but how it sets them up for absolute failure especially in that first century time frame and how it was in fact cruel based on what were going to learn from history tomorrow so end of our alia today i hope this has been informative please be sure and uh share this video with all of your friends like it subscribe to

descriptive writing vs critical analytical writing in research how to write critically examples,learn how to write critically by understanding the key differences between descriptive writing and critical analytical writing,in this video we are going to look at critical writing specifically the difference between descriptive writing and critical writing a lack of critical writing is one of the most common issues we encounter when we review dissertations and thesis and research papers here at grad coach so today we will unpack the thorny issue of critical writing to help you ace your project if you are new to the oftentimes intimidating world of academic research and writing be sure to hit that subscribe button for loads of plain language actionable advice also if you are currently working on a dissertation or thesis be sure to grab our free dissertation templates which guide you through each chapter step by step you can find the links to those in the description below all right so let us jump into it writing critically is one of the most important skills you will need to master for your academic journey but what exactly does this mean well when it comes to writing at least for academic purposes there are two main types descriptive writing and critical writing critical writing is also sometimes referred to as analytical writing so we will use these two terms interchangeably now to understand what constitutes critical or analytical writing it is useful to compare it against its opposite descriptive writing so let us have a little showdown descriptive versus critical at the most basic level descriptive writing merely communicates the what where when or who in other words it describes a thing place time or person it does not consider anything beyond that or explore the impact importance or meaning of the situation here is an example of a descriptive sentence yesterday the president unexpectedly fired the minister of finance as you can see this sentence just states what happened when it happened and who was involved classic descriptive writing contrasted to this critical writing takes things a step further and unveils the so what basically it explained the impact or consequence of a given situation let us stick with the same event and look at an example of analytical writing the presidents unexpected firing of the wellrespected finance minister had an immediate negative impact on investor confidence this led to a sharp decrease in the value of the local currency especially against the us dollar this devaluation means that all dollarbased imports are now expected to rise in cost thereby raising the cost of living for citizens and reducing disposable income as you can see in this example the descriptive version only tells us what happened the president fired the finance minister whereas the critical version goes on to discuss some of the impacts of the presidents actions ideally critical writing should always link back to the broader objectives of the paper or project explaining what each thing or event means in relation to those objectives in a dissertation or thesis this would involve linking the discussion back to the research aims objectives and research questions sounds a bit fluffy and conceptual well let us take a look at an example if your research aims involved understanding how the local environment impacts demand for speciality imported vegetables you would need to explain how the devaluation of the local currency means that the imported vegetables would become more expensive relative to locally farmed options this in turn would likely have a negative impact on sales as consumers would turn to cheaper local alternatives so as you can see critical or analytical writing goes beyond just describing that is what descriptive writing covers and instead focuses on the meaning of things events and situations within a research context a dissertation or a thesis critical writing links these things to the research aims objectives and research questions the golden thread if this sounds a bit foreign you can learn more about the golden thread and how that all fits together in this video alright so as i have mentioned descriptive writing focuses on the what while critical writing focuses on the so what the meaning to make this distinction a little more tangible let us look at how this plays out in a typical dissertation or research project within a literature review descriptive writing would explain what a theory author or journal article said whereas critical writing would explain how that is relevant to the key issues and research questions similarly within a methodology chapter descriptive writing would state which methods were used whereas analytical writing would explain why these methods were relevant and justified in light of the specific research aims lastly within a discussion chapter descriptive writing would merely state a relationship between two variables whereas critical writing would explain what this relationship means in terms of the research questions how it compares to existing research and if it contrasts with the literature why this might be so as you can see critical writing goes deeper scratching below the surface to extract the meaning and impact of things so does this mean you should avoid descriptive writing altogether not quite for the most part you will need some descriptive writing to lay the foundation for the critical analytical writing you will usually need to state the what before you can discuss the so what therefore description is simply unavoidable and in fact quite essential but you do want to keep it to a minimum and focus your word count on the analytical side of things as you write a good rule of thumb is to identify every what in other words every descriptive point you make and then check whether it is accompanied by a so what in other words a critical conclusion regarding its meaning or impact of course this will not always be necessary as some conclusions are fairly obvious and go without saying but this basic practice should help you minimise description maximise analysis and most importantly earn

galatians a critical review,galatians is perhaps the oldest of the letters of paul it represents the core and foundation of the gospel of paul galatians is,poker tov good morning welcome to a very special uh aliyah today although its not technically an aliyah but today were going to be talking about the letter to the galatians the epistle of the glands sometimes referred to as a book although its not really a book its just a letter be looking at galatians and and taking a critical review of it meaning that not critical in the sense that not necessarily that were going to be critical but although thats probably going to occur but rather that we are going to use some critical thinking about this particular letter looking at it from the standpoint of biblical faith of torah faith of scripture and discover what um discover what to think about it actually what to think about paul in general maybe and certainly what to think about this particular letter and well discuss why this is even a topic so glad youre here welcome please like this video please share with all your friends im sure going to want to um i hope you are anyway going to want to share this video because for those people out there who are openminded this may be a game changer for them uh moving forward and i hope it is because uh its its its teachings like this that i believe really set people free and of course im saying that in advance uh operating on faith that its going to pan out the way that i i expect but any case um why are we doing this today well because this week is kind of a bye week meaning that its kind of a repeat if not so because because of the way shovel fell this year uh this coming shabbat we have noso again so we covered noso last week in our studies and so forth and so it kind of opens us up gives us the opportunity anyway to um to to have uh some topical discussions that we may not usually cover and i was just had a conversation with somebody last week somebody who had visited our synagogue and was uh not exactly pleased with a discussion that we had about circumcision because they had been taught of course their whole life that circumcision been done away with and so on and so forth and so when i had this conversation with them they inevitably went right to the jugular they went to galatians and uh you know its a young man it was a young girl man excuse me i got a piece of lint on my shirt here sorry its bothered me uh there you go sorry um in any case uh young man uh younger walk in in faith i guess and you know his initial you know question to me was you know have you read galatians and of course this is very much a a very common uh comment to make for people like myself that teach about the law of moses and teach people to obey the law of moses because the idea is is that havent you read galatians because dont you know that what youre what youre teaching is wrong and of course uh from my point of view its its a little comical its a little little laughable because uh based on the age of this gentleman this young young man um you know ive been teaching ive been doing this since since he was in diapers and and so uh yes ive read galatians i ive read every book of the bible in fact and ive probably taught on just about every verse of every new testament letter uh most likely i know i have for galatians about probably about years ago or so i actually did a literally a verse by verse through the book of galatians trying to make sense of it uh which is a feat because its its a gymnastics twister event to be sure but you know this is the mindset of people um and the question becomes why galatians why why is that um that particular letter the one that people go to uh in in a case like this okay and the the reality is is because galatians represents the foundation it represents the the core of pauls gospel and i want you to hear the words that are coming out of my mouth today first and foremost let me say this let me say this before we go any further a lot of the conversation were going to have today is is potentially going to make the the the listener and the in the viewer uncomfortable and i dont mean it to be so um and im not im not going to be please dont dont be scared im not going to be unnecessarily verbose or unnecessarily argumentative here im were gonna were gonna were going to take a non to the extent possible were going to take a nonemotional critical review of this gospel of paul as presented in galatians and just discuss it were going to discuss galatians in general the overall philosophy and theology of of paul the reason i say its going to make people uncomfortable is because most people uh and myself included we came to this way of life we came to this understanding visavis christianity which means that there are theres there is some goodness within that walk to be sure and the reason theres goodness within it is because you know theres within christianity there is of course you know access to the actual scriptures which is the tanakh and the gospels of yeshua and so for a select few people who study the study the bible as they were christians and dug deeper than the baseline uh you know belief system they were being fed they they actually began to read the word of god and it led them here so in other words god used that system which which i talked about yesterday is or excuse me was yesterday whats today oh yes yesterday yesterday was the first day of the week as i talked on shabbat um is the system of falsehood and i know that was a bold statement i know it probably shook some peoples core but nevertheless hashem can use it but then again hashem can use anything to get us where he needs to be but heres the heres the point for the people who are walking this walk you already had to do critical thinking you already had to go beyond what was being fed to you and you actually had to read the scriptures for yourself theres a reason why by the way christianity otherwise known as catholicism i told somebody this last week that originally christians were catholics and there wasnt a difference and this person had been a catholic and now they were a christian and they didnt know that theyd never heard that before in their life as far as they know it was there was catholics and then one day christians were born and i explained to them no um actually for a long long time i dont know like years christians were catholics and then the reformation happened and then there was a gradual split and now today and you know the meaning of the words have changed is now when people say theyre a christian what they mean is that theyre protestant when they say theyre theyre catholic they mean theyre a catholic uh but thats not the way it used to be so bottom line is that for a long time you know christianity had this this way of thinking and there was a reason why originally catholics the the the rank and foul of catholics didnt read the bible they they were the only the priest read it and and the lay people basically didnt right and you hear that today you hear that today people in catholicism say um you know we were not trained or taught to read the bible uh why well uh because its a problem uh the the challenge with reading the bible is that you might actually obey it and if you do that then you will stop following traditional christian christianity thats just the reality uh how do we know this is true because one of the first people to re to to to protest thats what protestant means to protest against the ways of the catholic church was martin luther and martin luther decided it would be a good idea to print the bible and the and the common language so he printed it in uh um german well if you study the history of martin luther who by the way was not a good guy i any stress of imagination uh but putting that aside were not going to get off on martin luther who was a reprobate but um but if you actually study which i did one time studied about martin luther in kind of that time period you find that he ran into a big problem with the moravian segment of his area that they started to read the bible they started to eat kosher they started to keep the festivals and he had to put down that quote and i quote rebellion because it was a it was an unfortunate consequence of reading the bible is that people tend to want to obey it and thats why there are so many polemics and christianity today and both catholicism and reform which is both christianity by the way um theres so many polemics against following the law why because so many people who have copies of the bible want to follow the law why because thats what god says to do and so its a natural its a natural uh and and frankly a common sense approach to being obedient to god is by be doing what he says to do and it requires man to come along and tell us stop doing that let me make a statement here that again is just a common sense critical thinking um christianity would not exist as we know it today without paul now i want you to think about that what i just said i want you to think about what i just said christianity as we know it today would not exist without paul i didnt say it wouldnt exist without yeshua i did not say that it wouldnt exist without um the teachings of peter or yoken on john i didnt say that i didnt say it wouldnt exist without the teachings of james yaakov did i no i said that christianity as we know it today would not exist without the teachings of paul that is a so should be a sobering thought because how is it that an entire faith system which was created in rome in the th century um is based entirely not somewhat but entirely on the writings of a single man anybody heard of mormonism anybody heard of mormonism joseph smith joseph smith had a allegedly had a personal divine encounter by himself in which he received a unique revelation and as a result he wrote writings that were based on that revelation and they are considered scripture by mormons its called the book of mormon does that even sound remotely familiar to the road to damascus experience im just saying again dont let your emotions and your nostalgia mess you up right now theres another reason by the way by the way why i say not to get emotional and that is because christianity listen ive been there ive been the christian bible school ive taught i was a christian pastor before i have no shame in admitting that its not a shameful thing uh thats my journey and its its given me a wonderful perspective and its given me a lot of empathy for people like you that are listen to me to help you but let me just tell you something straightforward here can i christianity is a religion and listen let me just say this too because i i im a very passionate person as you probably have figured it out im i have no problem making bold statements as you probably know i am not shy or scared im not trying to be boastful right now i need that please dont misunderstand but i have no problem just speaking the truth straight out i i sometimes tap the brakes even though it may not seem like it but i tap the brakes because you know to quote the famous movie you cant handle the truth uh i say that tongueincheek im just kind of kidding but seriously i have no problem with this okay im not at all scared i dont i i dont i am not somebody who needs uh i dont know whatever whatever im just not scared of it but heres the reality christianity and uh oh what i was trying to say by the way im sorry i got i got off track what i was trying to say is im not this is not a polemic against christianity im not bashing christians i love christian people they are they are genuinely good people i dont care for the religion and yes its a religion please please dont say its just a relationship i understand that way of thinking but it is at the end of the day absolutely look up the definition of religion thats all you have to do get a websters dictionary look up the definition of religion because we you know you cant play with things and its its a religion but anyway im not trying to bash the people i am i do have a problem with the with the religion not the people does that make sense like you know love the center sinner i hate the sin that type of thing okay so the problem with christianity is it is very much think about it please please im trying to get you to become a critical thinker in this area it is very much a religion of fear guys its been that way study study the history of the church the church keeps people in line by fear think about it why dont people keep the law of moses today because theyre afraid because theyve been taught this way that they will lose their salvation now thats crazy i want to put your fear at ease and tell you right now that god hashem will never send you to hell for obeying his word he will never send you to hell for being obedient thats not how it works guys we dont go to hell we werent destined for hell because we obeyed god we were destined for hell because we disobeyed god adam was not kicked out of the garden because he followed the word of god adam was kicked out of the garden because he disobeyed the word of god but christianity keeps us i say us euphemistically in fear people are afraid theyre afraid to have this conversation right now because theyve been taught that you cant disagree with a man let me ask you a question just critical thinking here critical thinking can somebody can someone believe fully and the atoning work of messiah yeshua and yet at the same time reject paul can someone believe the gospel of yeshua believe in the atoning work of yeshua and yet reject paul and believe that we should follow the law of moses can somebody do that im gonna im gonna say yes and if the answer is no thats a huge problem huge because what it really betrays if that is if if youre sitting there today and youre listening to me because god brought you here and youre thinking to yourself well no you you cannot believe in yeshua and the gospel yeshua and yet reject brother paul then that what let me tell you what that means what that means is ultimately your faith is in paul because its that first of all thats an absurd thing to say i can believe in salvation in the messiah but i just i just reject the paulinian philosophy and to say that im not really a believer or im not really in the covenant or im im you know off track or or whatever is insane because what youre really saying is is i i have to believe paul which means that paul is the guy again this is critical thinking i want you to ask yourself the hard questions and think about it think it through now heres the other problem galatians is as i said a second ago is the corpus its the its the its the its the crux its the foundation of pauls theology and i want to emphasize pauls theology this is undoubtedly pauls gospel i didnt say yeshuas gospel i said pauls gospel now what i just said to you is not just my opinion but it is in fact the opinion of scholars and theologians nearly across the board as ive been studying this out looking at the even the encyclopedia judaica looking at other writers i have a book here which is probably the best worst book on the on galatians as an absolute abomination um written by thomas lancaster first design on galatians i got about years ago its a horrible book dont even waste your money on it um the reason i bought it years ago is because back in those days i was still formulating my opinion of paul and i was trying to get some clarity and i thought that this book would help and the reason its a terrible book is not its only because um to be fair mr lancaster um writes he basically just approaches paul from the traditional point of view but its absurd and well get to some of the quotes maybe not today depending on our time but well get to some pool quotes from this but uh i dont know how anybody with rational thought and i im not trying to be uh unfair or or what have you im just looking at it again this is a critical review its not emotional its critical um were talking here about scripture okay were talking about things that matter um and i dont know how anybody could write what he writes with a straight face and not immediately go what this these and by the way his book is really compilations according to him sermons hes done on galatians but again i read some of the quotes and its immediate danger danger will robins immediate red flags cultic kind of stuff anybody heard of ellen g white ellen g white was a woman who professed to be a a prophet and shes the one who started the seven were not started but she her writings are practically scripture if not scripture by the seventhday adventist church uh in any case um its just crazy so so so galatians represents pauls gospel and and it is in fact absolutely pauls gospel the problem with pauls gospel and this is this is true its fact the problem with pauls gospel is it cannot be supported with the scriptures it cannot be supported by using the scriptures which are also the gospels it cannot be supported using logic and it cannot be supported using common sense let me say that again and this is this is so important and and i know for people and im im trying to reach people today i hope you know that and i empathize with the spirit of fear thats probably coming on you right now as youre listening to me because you know youve been youve been mentally conditioned to believe that if you if you take an opposing view here to maybe some of the writings of paul that youre going to go right to hell and i under i im not kidding you im not trying to be superfluous i understand and i i i empathize with you right now but but trust me when i say that uh this is going to set you free how is it going to set me free rabbi its going to set you free to actually do what god wants you to do see not following the law of moses is bondage friends not following gods law is thats the definition of bondage okay why why do i say that is that my opinion am i did i just pull that out of thin air no because the scripture tells us that sin is bondage and sin is breaking the law of moses thats the definition of sin therefore if i am not father in law of moses i am in sin which means im in bondage so pauls gospel let me just say it again let me repeat it again pauls pauls gospel now by the way let me let me pause here im going to say this earlier rabbi whats your opinion of paul well i always try to judge favorably um which is very hard to do when it comes to paul by the way and the reason its hard to do is because everything works with the message everything lines up from genesis all the way through the last word in john and you could even say theres no issues with peters letters theres no issues with jamess letter theres no issues with johns letter those are just letters but still so everything lines up in perfect alignment nothing is a problem from genesis the from the first word of genesis to the last word of john theres no problems but everything everything all the wills fly off when you get to pauls letters thats a problem friends thats a huge problem you can say that everything agrees until you get to pauls writings thats a problem that that should be sobering ive said this before that people cannot use the scriptures and the gospels alone to come to the same conclusion that paul does in his gospels if youre not using pauls writings you cannot teach me the gospel according to paul using just the scriptures thats a problem and its a fact by the way you cant do it you know why because the scriptures and the gospels are in direct opposition to what paul says thats just a fact now having said that um im inclined you know to show favoritism and to believe that paul was not misunderstood no no thats no no but rather like people just messed with his letters thats farfetched but im willing to go there just to try to not throw somebody under the bus however having said that in this discussion we are going to take paul at face value because quite frankly guys uh if yall can just speak honestly between me and you please dont tell anybody else but im just kind of sick of trying to make paul make sense um thats just me thats just a personal thing um so at this juncture were gonna were just taking a face value were going to take him how out how he has been traditionally understood um and we can debate discuss over a cup of coffee uh whether or not he was misunderstood or whether or not he you know his writings were hijacked or or whatever um and frankly it doesnt even matter its academic actually but um whats often said in quoting kefa is that they say well pauls letters contain things that are difficult to understand i agree yeah thats true because theyre not scriptural um which makes it its a head scratcher and guys i know that we have a were almost out of time today well come back and do a part two of this for sure but um its just a fact much much of what he says much of what he writes about it again taking it at face value uh and its just its simply not scriptural um actually uh what what else about the situation that we should need to look at here um let me turn back and and lets just talk about this particular um letter itself as were looking at it yall okay still everybody okay out there all right um so galatians is considered to be really the oldest book in the new testament literature why is does it mean that they they preceded the gospels no um i mean they did it did in the sense of being written down but you have to understand something that in judaism the teaching of a rabbi was all oral they didnt write anything down the only thing written down was the bible what we call the bible the tanakh so the gospels would have been oral so obviously the gospels predates the writing of galatians obviously now not again pardon me they were written down later which by the way is a great argument for the oral torah people who reject the oral torah accept the gospels but the gospels were oral before they were written down so you see where logic is so important this is why im constantly telling you begging you to use your brain most people dont theyre theyre just like little robots they just they just believe whatever they believe and they dont think about things critically they dont use logic they dont use common sense and as a result they they have silly um you know silly uh ideas but any case so galatians okay um i want to im going to read this to you i want you to think about the fact that an entire faith system is is for all intents and purposes is based you know you can make the argument that its based on this letter um but really its based on the corpus of his letters which by the way there are some say letters who are attributed to paul only seven of those that he actually write but well get into that another time but anyway it says galatians um there is no original letter that has been known to survive so so right off the bat we have no original copies the earliest reasonable reasonably complete version which is called uh papyrus p dates to about ce which is based on the scholarly estimations about years after the original was written um its the papyrus or papyrus rather papyrus the papyrus is um its fragmented so its not even complete but what it says here in this writing about it that uh that the papers is fragmented in a few areas causing some of the original text uh to be missing however through careful research relating to to construction the paper handwriting development blah blah blah scholars have been able to piece together and correct some errors and changes which which they believe would have been part of the original text so so here here we go problem number one we have this text that were tr that people are telling us is is the holy word of god and its fragmented we dont even have the whole thing scholars have had to go in and kind of fill in the gaps its not exactly um confidence building um so were thats problematic isnt it uh so here here we are we have this issue were basing everything on this letter and its a letter by the way its a letter that paul wrote to uh defend his gospel now um let me just say this let me just close close this session by saying this were going to come back tomorrow and get in we have i have a lot more to discuss about this well come back tomorrow for part two of this because i have a lot more a lot great many more notes about this particular issue at hand and also were going to read some things out of um the the not the legends but the um encyclopedia judaica and then of course im going to refer to some quotes by mr lancaster here were going to go over them and yeah i think youll see pretty much straight away why its ridiculously um scary uh but any case well look at that but let me let me just start by finish by saying this ive ive studied the bible for years study these letters but something jumped out of me just yesterday that i was looking at i thought you know why does paul constantly have to defend his calling applause no one else does you never hear anybody else have to defend their calling why is paul constantly having to convince people that hes a true apostle whats interesting i never really gave that much thought i because i guess to a certain degree we all have that mental conditioning weve been mentally conditioned that the people that opposed him were evil and wicked and they were out of gods will and they just were trying to bad mouth him and so forth first of all thats not true at all actually the people that opposed him were believers in the messiah and they were faithful to the law of moses they were lapidniks actually um but the reason that paul constantly had to defend his calling is because what he was teaching was a not in alignment with scripture and b and this is where were going to conclude and well come back tomorrow and pick up on this this is huge its huge let me repeat this again the reason his he was always opposed and tried to come constantly tried to defend himself is because what he was teaching was a not in a limo scripture and b not the same gospel as the disciples were teaching end of our aliyah today well come back tomorrow we got a lot more to talk about this topic and i hope that youre enjoying it more importantly i hope that its that god is using it to start helping us get set free so that we can start following the word of god the tour of god the law of god shalom will look forward to seeing everybody oh by the way happy memorial day and thank god for all the veterans whove given their life so that you and i can have freedom memorial day is an american holiday theres nothing wrong with celebrating holidays as long as theyre not pagan based and this is not one of those this is a holiday that is based on an american custom of honoring the men and women whove given their life so that i can do and you can do what were doing right now so god bless all of you look forward to seeing you tomorrow

deadpool amp wolverine full review deadpool kills the fox marvel universe,deadpool and wolverine full review deadpool kills the fox marvel universe ryan reynolds hugh jackman xmen return,get your special sock out nerds its gone get good welcome back everyone its charlie this will be my full deadpool and wolverine review the movie is out everywhere please go see it as quickly as possiblebecause theres so much stuff going on theres so much we have to talk about theres so much that happens during itso much in the way that it changes the nature of the mcuthe direction of the mcu in a good way we will be talking about this movie for a while if youre brand new to the channelbe sure to subscribe to get all the videos it is comicon weektheres a bunch of stuff happening this weekend of course i will do videos for everything spoiler warning for this video because i will be talkingabout specific points in the movie i did a nonspoiler review a couple days ago if you havent seen the movie yet you can watch thatvideo first and then watch this video but i know one of the biggest questionspeople are going into this movie asking is deadpool going to be marvel jesus will he save the mcu or completely destroyedor save it by destroying it the movie was designed to be kind of like spidermanno way home but for all the classic pre mchugh fox marvel moviesin other non fox marvel movies before iron man one there were a lot of mcu references during thisbut it was mostly about those classic movies sort of like deadpool no way home deadpool kills the fox marvel universe in even though i dont think that deadpool will wind upbeing the actual marvel jesus if you speak in a more metaphorical sense like evenat the end of the movie he says that he is not marvel jesus this movie does go a very very long way towardsputting marvel back on the right track like it doesnt completely fix marvel like itsnot a one and done kind of deal they still have to stick the landing with captain america for brave new worldnext year the thunderbolts movie all the way through avengers five in avengers six secret warslike they had to continue sticking the landing they cant just do it one timeand then go back to the old dissatisfying movies but probably one of my favorite parts of this movieis that it completely takes the piss out of marvel right nowand all the old marvel stuff as well too thats kind of deadpools thing he does that to pretty much anybody just in general theyve been included jokes about the cash grab of itall like hugh jackman happy to come back for the big bag of disney cashbecause of his recent divorce the movie actually references hugh jackmans divorcein real life which he was happy to do like right before the movie came out he did announce that he was getting

marvels low pointthey even call that out in the movie he tells you jackmans wolverine congratulations to join the mcuyoure joining at a low point right now they use every opportunity to clown onwhats happening at marvel right now whats happenedthe past couple of years since avengers endgame kevin feige he talked about this phenomenonspecifically during all the recent interviews where he said one of the biggest things at marvelis that theyre able to actually laugh at themselves like he didnt give them any notes about jokesthat they could not use thats why you saw all the kevin feige jokes the disney jokesthe marvel jokes just in general inside the trailers kevin feige himselfeven said that he had to have conversations with some of the other executives at marveland at disney to explain what pegging was supposed to be scary pegging isnt new for me friendo but it is for disney but they still left it in the movieand still let it be a rated r movie which i think could have potentially been disastrousif disney had not let them do that that was probably one of the biggest fearsthat people had when disney bought fox and there are a lot of references to that as well to some of my favorite parts of the moviereferencing a lot of real life events to early on bob iger ceo of disney said that they would be happyto let deadpool continue to be rated r and kevin feigereiterated that fact recently during the interviews even though hes meant to be in chargeof all the marvel creative he still has to answer to disney overlord himselfwhich they also do reference during the movie in fact with the success of this moviei think its supposed to do like million worldwide opening weekend which is why a lot of people are saying thatmarvel is back because the box office is also back to he said the success of this movie is opening the doorfor more very hardcore rrated movies in the future the next rated r one that i know that theyre actuallyworking on right now is the actual blade movie there are many jokes about the blade movie during this to all the different blade movies particularly marvels troublein actually getting that new blade movie made will there ever be another blade besides wesley snipes wesley snipes does not think so real great joke during the movie going into this i knew that they were going to bea lot of references and easter eggs cameo scenes from old fox marvel moviesold xmen movies in general but actually seeing it seeing the way that they pay honor to a lot ofthose movies i think was actually the icing on the cake like it wasnt just cameos for cameos sakeor clowning on a lot of the weaker old movies too because there are a lot of stinkers in those old movies like they have some bright spotsbut there are a lot of cameos that they use from those movies in this new moviethat help make those old movies seem better like the jokes make them seem bettermake the characters seem better to the funny thing about that is that dave filoni did thata lot during the star wars clone wars episodes too like trying to make the prequel moviesseem better after the prequels came out because they got clowned on so muchwhen they originally came out in theaters like if youve ever heard dave filoni talk about the true meaning of the prequelsthats kind of what deadpool does in this movie for a lot of those classic fox marvel movies speaking of which the original wesley snipesblade movies which ryan reynolds himself was also part ofwhich they also clowned as well like he never liked me the mcu just in general would not existwithout the success of that original blade movie back in the late s its like the godfather of the mcu it would have been weird if they didnt tryto have a cameo scene with wesley snipes in this film i know thered be a lot of questionsabout how that went down and the relationship between wesley snipesand ryan reynolds because of all the supposed history and drama between the two of themon the set of those blade movies but well talk about thatduring my full breakdown and easter eggs video apparently its all water under the bridge therell be a lot of talk about how dense the movie iswith references easter eggs jokes cameo scenes but i think the way they use the tva to sort ofbring everything together crystallize all these different things that it was trying to dohelp make the movie make sense like it was the perfect opportunityto make this all happen how do we bring deadpool to the mcu while at the same time having a regular standalonedeadpool story that just works on its own without all the other referencesbut also incorporate all those old xmen other marvel movies with those classic actorsgiving them their own version of spiderman no way home and they totally pulled it offlike they totally stuck the landing i think a big part of that is how creatively involvedryan reynolds himself is with the writing of the actual moviesand the character himself i make the comparison to robert downeyjr in the iron man movies so completely inhabits the character that you kind of forgetwhere the character begins and where the actor ends and because the movie is meant to beas much a wolverine movie as it is a deadpool movie which is why theyre calling it deadpool and wolverineand not just deadpool the same is true for hugh jackmans wolverine likehe so completely inhabits that character that its really hardto imagine anybody else being wolverine kevin feige even said after thishe doesnt have any plans to recast wolverine any time soon meaning that hughjackman will come back in multiple upcoming movies not just avengers secret warsbut probably some other movies as well too and because of the way they use the tvathe sort of meta nature of bringing this all together all these different aspectsthey were able to use the movie itself to fix a lot of what wasnt working about the mcu just in general rightnow would you think a lot of people were wondering about going into the movies likeis this going to save marvel just in general the movie starts to do that by namelystarting to move past the multiverse of at all they even directly call that fact outat the end of the movie saying that everyone has gotten so tired of the multiverse of all this can we stop this like weve had enough just to address some of the complaintsthat ive seen of people coming out of the movie there have been a few complaints from people that arent super big marvel fans and most of the complaintsare coming from nonwhite marvel fans the fact that its so laserspecific in its references in jokes and so complete that you truly do need to have watcheda lot of those classic fox marvel movies in order to get the full meaning of it like to get the fullunderstanding the full course and if you have watched a lot of those old movies it was gloriouseverything we could have hoped for and more cannot say enough good thingsabout the next level action scenes in this movie the fight scenes are amazing it never feels like it turns any kind of cg mudlike we saw during antman the wasp quantumania they take the fight scenes of the previousdeadpool movies and upgrade them in a really big way you will never believe what theyve donewith wolverines fight scenes in this he fightslike you always hoped that he fight from the comics probably one of my favorite fight scenesand this is actually a surprising one is them just inside the car just the two of them fighting inside that minivan probably one of the most creative fight scenes thatweve seen in any marvel movie before just in general including the captain america winter soldier elevatorfight scene i would say its on par with that if youve been following the developmentof a lot of marvel movies too they also get into that stuff as well too for instance the channing tatum gambit moviethat never got me that wound up getting canceled or the x sequel movie to loganthat never wound up getting made so the bigger fan of marvelthat youve been over the last like to years the more you will enjoy this movie but on the other side of that like this is wherewe addressed the complaints of all the non marvel fans if you were going into this movie totally fresh not having seen any of the other fox marvel moviesthe old deadpool movies the old xmen movies or like older marvel movies just in generalor even some of the older mcu movies a lot of the movie might not make sense to you and i do think that is fairbut i still think that even the most casual of fans like if you just wandered into the movie and knewnothing about marvel at all like youd never seen any of the marvel movies before you still findsome of the needle drops in real life references pretty funny some of the jokes are pretty on the nose pretty overt like the disney jokesor the jokes about the fox disney buyout or youd at least get the vibeof some of the things that they reference because this is meant to be a spoilervideo well talk about some of my favorite cameos you know wtf moments from the moviehugh jackman in the yellow suit that was a dreamweve been asking for that for so long even if you havent watched all the marvel movieswolverine has been one of the most popular characters in comicsfor a long time now but weve never actually gotten to see a live action version of himthat seems closer to the actual comic book version and thats kind of the vibe of the mcu movies ingeneral trying to be more comic book just in general so putting him inthe yellow suit was finally paying that off and they have some jokes about that toofinally being in that suit all of his cameos as the other versions of wolverinein different universes were also icing on the cake some of them even referenced stuff that theyve done onxmen the animated series and xmen fun fact too as the movie was coming outthere was also a rumor that theyre working on an actual hulk versus wolverine film but i dont knowwhat the timeline on that would potentially be i would love to see that moviebut i still think that marvel has some legal troubles with universal when it comes to the rightsfor hulk movies just in general all the henry cavill wolverine references were crazy the cavalry the jokes at dcs expense about them treating him so much better at marvelthan they did across the street at dc i love them paying off those jokes too that was almost like a john krasinski reed richardsfantastic four kind of cameo scene in doctor strange multiverse of madness where it was this long time fan rumor that people believedthat he was going to be the next version of wolverine so they actually put him in the movieto reference that fact cannot say enough about daphne keene coming back as xfor her scene in the fact that they leave her around at the end of the movie so that she can come backfor more movies potentially in the future i dont think that shes going to replacehugh jackmans wolverine or anything like that i know therell be a lot of questionsabout whats going on with them in the future dont worry i will address that during my future bonus videos but her presence in the moviewinds up being critical to the development of the new version of hugh jackmanswolverine that hes playing during this film its not just a cameo for cameo sake likehey look at her can i say enough about the chris evans cameo scene is is johnny storm human torch from the old fantasticfour movies we believe that he was going to be in the moviein some way for a long long time but what they actually did with him in the filmgoes way beyond my expectations along with the pay off that they include for thatin the actual postcredits scene love the channing tatum version of gambit i already talked about how they were paying offa lot of real life things during his cameo scenes too like wanting to be the herothat he never got the chance to be because dot dot dot they canceled his film after the fox disney buyout even the ben affleck daredevil jokes about his divorcewith jennifer garner in real life like oh he died thats so sad and shes totally fine with it likedont worry its fine because they got divorced fun fact there ben affleckactually did visit the set of the movie which is why people thoughtthat his daredevil was coming back during the film but he was just visiting the set with their kids that they shared to have funbecause of her being in the movie but it all works together including the mcu marvel references to the jokesabout the classic marvel movies actors making them all seem like better movies in generalbetter characters in general im going to have to go backand watch some of those old movies again too after we make it to this weekend to comiccon theres just so much happening right nowbut in a good way therell be a couple times during the film where thingswill slow down a little bit and then speed back up so there are a couple minor pacing issuesbut the movie is just jam packed i would have been totally finewith like a four hour movie which they also joke about during the film with ryan reynolds deadpoolsaying audiences are accustomed to longer runtimes despite the fact that the actual runtime of this movieputs it on the shorter end of marvel movies one of the reasons why studios will dothat is so that they can actually screen the movie more frequently in theatersand potentially earn more money from ticket sales because the tickets cost the same amount of moneyas the longer movies do which they also reference during this film ryan reynoldsand hugh jackman are going to make themselves some big bags of marvel cash i know therell be a lot of questionsabout shawn levy as director of the movie hes done a lot of films with ryan reynolds previously thats the reason why he did this film becauseryan reynolds just like working with him so much they worked so well together i will say right now he did a great job at turning outa really solid movie on a very very tight schedule like it theres a lot of moving partsor a lot of complicated things a lot of cameo scenes he did a good job of balancing all of those thingswithout losing sight of the actual story itself or the heart of the characters that is why a lot of people are like wait a minutedoes this mean hes going to direct the next xmen movie or one of the avengers movies i think that hes capable of doing something like that like if he can handle all these charactershe could probably handle the avengers movie even though there are now rumors about marvel bringing the russo brothers back to do avengersfive and avengers secret wars personally i think that theyre the safer betjust because they have that proven track record with avengers infinity war avengers endgameeven the classic captain america movies but it is such a solid job with this movie i think that marvel is definitely bringing him backfor some other movie maybe not necessarily deadpool four because theyre definitely going to be doing deadpoolfour at some point now maybe not for several years but theyll still do it just in general the movie will leave you very hopefulabout the direction of marvel going forward like the hype has returned legacy thoughtheres still all these other movies that are coming out next year the year after like captain americafour brave new world thunderbolts those still have to stick the landing like deadpoolnow isnt going to fix those movies in the future but based on the captain america four trailer based on a lot of the changesthat weve heard about behind the scenes it sounds like marvel has been on the right track deadpool and wolverine the movie is just the first real big example of thatlike weve actually seen in theaters with our own eyes its one thing to hear that marvel has started to turn the ship aroundbut its another to actually see it in action so if you havent seen the movie yetand you did happen to watch this video thank you very much for watching the video but please go see the movie right now everybody post your

critical review of agust ds dday the movie the good the bad the ugly,patreon patreoncomuseru website talk to me anytime,kindness in the midst of the unkind unkind that was the concept to many especially those not used to the depth of sugas artistic well this could sound like another abuse of the seductive evil concept thats becoming more common nowadays they would be wrong of course sugas focus was not on the unkindness of the situation he found himself in or the people that tried to put him down as he himself stated the unkind concept was only demonstrated in the beginning and in the end in the entirety of the show his goal was to get closer to the audience interact with them directly see the fans faces and make eye contact with them while he opened the show helplessly being carried into the middle of the stage and as he sang of the barbaric attempts to put him to the ground his action was the exact opposite his goal was to reach out he was showing kindness in the midst of the unkind he removed the barrier separating him from armys even if it meant going down from the pedestal he rightfully owned he stood closer to the crowd even if it meant risking the chances of getting mobbed he did things he knew the audience liked from high notes to glissando he spoiled armys rotten the world was unkind to suga but suga was always is kind to his world hi sorry that it took me half a week before i could actually be calm enough to do this video uh i did not expect to cry it was really embarrassing because everyone was dancing around they were singing they all had their army bomb and i was like just crying but i hope that through the course of the video you will understand how i felt so if you do end up liking this video please give it a thumbs up of course share the

ahead and do that i can discuss and become more spontaneous there and also follow me on x and on twitter im uploading new content there other than what im uploading here and of course in instagram all right on to the video the damn samsung there were a lot of things the movie didnt emphasize that i wish they did but they also managed to provide a broader context to some details that i didnt fully digest in the live concert the significance of the damn phone cameras was one of them during the interlude shadow song the dancers crowded him carrying phones and using its camera throughout the song i understood the significance of course this is to represent the controllable attention of the media and by extension the world by the end of the show with all the platforms gone he calmly walked into the middle mirroring the camera surrounding him during interlude shadow cameras were all around him but no one was crowding him it was him walking into the spotlight yes cameras were all around him but only on his own terms the cameras are fixed on their places he was able to leave anytime he wanted and walked back when he felt like it this is him accepting his fame in his own terms to a certain degree even the now famous selfie or selca portion of the show may be a clear statement to everyone how and when he appears to the public will be decided by him it may be our camera but he decides when we can use it on him ill own the stage there are good performers and they are the ones that look good on stage but then there are great artists these are the people that command the stage and this isnt just about the precision of their dance moves or the perfection of the note that they hit its about performing in front of the crowd and making them believe every rhyme that an artist delivers its about making the audience understand every narrative that you offer its about making the audience experience what they went through that resulted in the music they sculpted with their heart and soul its about changing the audience in a single night for the better in at least one way that actually matters thats why artists need to put themselves in a place where they can embody their music to the fullest when they perform when they stand in front of thousands they have to believe they can move the audience before them more than anyone has ever believed in them there is no space for humility at that moment they have to lead a crowd eat up the world and know more than anyone else there is no other person in the world who can do what they are about to do but themselves some may think its arrogant you can call it that if you want but it is in fact the most necessary thing in the world for anyone who stands in front of a crowd you cant make others believe you if you dont believe in what youre saying and doing but theres also the other side when the artist leaves the stage and they let go of the persona that they had when they were on stage its harder to go down from that high of thousands screaming for your name and stop being a celebrity to just become another human being one in billions occupying a shared space under the sun its its hard not to let the fame and the power stay in your head and the mere fact that suga always comes back to being min yoongi the shy introverted workaholic songwriter and producer his mother and fathers son one in thats whats truly impressive one more time for those at the back sugas creative genius and creative controll in action i wasnt even sure why i was surprised to hear the whole concert concept was his idea and one that surprised even a veteran concert director from to now haters and fake critics continue to attempt to invalidate the control bts has over their careers and creatives painting them to be weak poppets of greedy capitalists man in suit suga subtly talking about this whole concert and its concept being his idea and it was one that has never been explored before is just another proof that suga is the king of his kingdom he built it with his own hand and has complete control over his own dominion cope reclaiming nevermind when he performed nevermind it did feel like he was reclaiming that song for himself as well nevermind is such an important part of the discography and the history of bts but we all know that he wrote it and that he performed it and that he produced it and that moment in the documentary it felt like it was him sort of reclaiming all the things that he had to give up all the things about himself the parts of himself he had to give up a lot in order to become a member of bts and it felt like in that moment he was reclaiming all of that that part of him as a producer in daegu gloss the underground uh rapper uh being a member of that other seven seven me group who he was making music with he for he had to forget all of that in that moment in the film when he was singing it it felt like he was reclaiming all of that he was reclaiming everything that he had to leave behind and i think the real power of suga as a producer as a songwriter and as a rapper is the ability to show everybody what hes going through and then make it like a template in order to allow and encourage people to do the same so at that moment it felt like he was reminding me or everybody else that before life humbled us before pain took over before trauma damaged us there were parts of us who were brave and and bright and hopeful and excited for life and and other parts that we forgot because we had to live and we had to survive on a daily basis and we had to get over the things that pained us and hurt us and it was that moment when i felt like he was telling everybody come on now like you need to go back to all of that dont lose that because thats all part of you so and i think thats really one moment in the film like my god its just he the power that he has as an artist its just a different level i was trying not to cry the narrative progression of the rap line songs mirrors the maturity of his identity i have listened to each of their cyphers and ddaeng and og hundreds of times its so familiar that i dont really pay attention to the details anymore him singing the cyphers made me notice the progress in the narrative of the cyphers and the rap line songs may actually mirror the maturity of his identity of him coming into his own earlier cyphers were rough mostly expressing their angst then he became more reactive throwing jabs and hooks towards his haters eventually he started focusing on his art highlighting how superior his flow beats and rhymes are but with ddaeng and og it was more a smirk a diss with more of an abandoned than there is angst it felt like it was also tracing the growth of his career and perhaps his mental condition it shows just how far he has come as an artist and as a person he didnt need to be angry anymore and there was no contempt just confidence and indifference his rhymes were finally not for haters they werent to prove himself to anyone anymore instead he used it to play and toy with them like a master puppeteer it was savagery at its finest but also cathartic his skill wasnt being held down by his hate anymore his rhymes were sharpened by his own satisfaction confidence and happiness it was a connection not just a show suga wanted army to see him on a human level that much was evident it seems to be a strange proposition given that this is a concert tour the paragon of entertainment for musicians but he himself stated that he wanted to create a show where fans were just going to simply enjoy themselves instead of getting pinned on their seats to watch him put on a show he explored every corner off the stage got as close as he could to the audience and transitioned from shiny black jacket to tatter jeans and loose shirt by the end of the show but its also important to note how he actually ended the entire tour with one of his earliest song and one of his most vulnerable the last spoke about his depression the accident and other hardships he had to go through during the earlier days of his career but its a song that also addresses his fans the arms hoping they could be proud of who he has become he could have ended it with amygdala more recent and definitely a successful single instead he ended it with one of his heaviest and earliest songs it felt like he was reminding us of who he was and who we were before their success we were all just people finding reasons to connect and go on and this was his way of telling us that just like him we should go on its for army its funny how it triggers people whenever army claims bts does a lot of the things that they do for army even if they are actually proven right at the end something about bts and armys mutual loyalty doesnt sit well with a lot of people what many miss is both the sincerity and sound business reasoning behind it on a business level it is natural to cater to your own market army is their paying customer why would they create content for those who wont care about what they are offering its counterintuitive since their debut they have been creating music that that speaks of their own experiences and sentiments and from there attracted the attention and loyalty of fans who related to their message is this concept so rare in the music industry that people think is just fan service but then its also common humanity bts is the most successful asian act bar none against discrimination against stereotyping financial troubles and lack of network bts managed to revolutionize the music industry and practically had no one else on their court except their own small management company and army everyone else was a barrier on a human level its natural for them to develop loyalty towards the people loyal to them you love back the people that love you thats just being a good human being bts was being forced to leave the people who never left them from the two rows in their first music show to that fateful night in busan where they were taken out of the lineup to the pandemic army waited and bts knows they will continue to wait suga simply did what only he could do at that point with enough songs in his portfolio and enough time on his hands he toured hoping that the memories that he will be leaving behind will keep armycompany while they wait and like that night in busan and that year pandemic when they couldnt leave anything behind for armys while they wait suga decided to create memories knowing maybe it wont be enough but at least he did what he couldnt do before saying goodbye to min yoongi the person joining the military changes you thats one thing that is common among all the soldiers ive spoken with it really change you and once you it changes you you really cant go back its going to change every fiber of your being and i think thats part of the reason he said that that tour in that final day it felt like he was saying goodbye to min yoongi the person rather than the performer because he knew the after the military he would go back to music but hes going to be a different person just because just because being a part of such uh being a small part of such a big organization playing a small role in such an important countrywide mission it has a way of humbling you it has a way of giving you perspective in a way that is going to change you completely and so i think he knew that to a certain extent and thats part of the reason he said he felt like he was saying goodbye to min yoongi and its a little sad because it felt like they were the whole of bts including him it felt like they were getting in the groove of things like they were settling down on who they were in the life that they were were living after going through years of chaos they were finally settling down and then they have to leave that life and then serve the military and so it kind of felt sad as well but i also i im just hoping that hes fully present in this experience and that i i dont know his condition in the military i hope that hes healthy and hes at peace and that he is he is seeing a different side of life and i hope that when he comes back as a musician its going to make him better but thats i think thats why um he said that he was saying goodbye to min yoongi i think the emotions that i felt was also something very personal when they debuted in i moved to the us the same year so it felt like as they were starting their journey i was starting my journey as well and right at this moment when things are changing for them things are changing for me too so it kind of like it felt like i was seeing myself in them and i think thats why i felt very very emotional um and it was also it also felt like it felt like that when when he was saying goodbye to min yoongi to certain part of himself it also feels the same way for me that i was also saying goodbye to a certain part of myself and so i think thats just why i feel so while everybody else was dancing i was just crying um but you know you know thats as ive said thats really his power as a as a musician and as a performer the ability to open up himself so that you can see you in him um and i hope that it happens to you too i hope that you will be able to relate uh to some of the things that he is going through some of the things that he is showing and also uh get some clarity in the things that hes showing and the things that he is saying in the documentary i would love to know your thoughts i would love to if theres anything that you want to share let me know in

an overly long and critical review of paper mario the origami king,i have some very serious problems with paper mario the origami king if you like what i do please consider supporting me on,so it has come to this it is finally time to reviewanother paper mario game i reviewed color splash when it came out and that was pretty early in my channel s life covering the game was what really launched my career so it s kind of surreal to be here again enough time has passed that nintendo has made another paper mario game and here i am reviewing it as well things have come full circle and i can t help but reflect on everything so much has changed i ve changed i started putting sweet peppers on my pizza makes all the difference in the world and i didn t even know it back then before we get started a couple things first whether or not this is a spoilery review kind of depends on who you are we ll be showing footage from a good number of major areas of the game it s more than i would personally want to see before playing a game though almost every single interesting visual element was shown in the trailers so if you studied those closely enough i m sure you ll be fine here if you re more on the sensitive side i won t be going into a lot of story specifics so if you listen without watching you should be fine as well i will however be lightly touching on a concept that was only shown in little snippets in the trailers because it s a pretty common mechanic so it s a part of the discussion and that might be a little much for some viewers basically we tried to strike a middle ground with what s told and what s shown and ultimately it s up to you to decide if you want to watch or just listen or neither the second thing to mentioni m going hard on this game this is one of those reviews that s not to say it s a purely terrible game in fact in ways it s phenomenal you want to know what arlo thinks if it s worth buying or whatever i say yeah probably it s got a tremendous amount of stuff to offer even the most hardcore paper mario fans if that s all you wanted to hear then shut this off and go pick it up at the very least you ll love the world and the story and the characters and hey maybe you ll even end up liking the rest as well plenty of people have thing is i have some major major problems with how this game is designed and even further i feel like it represents some very serious problems at nintendo seeing what is in my opinion an opportunity to create another nintendo legacy gem thrown away for no good reason has really got my critical juices pumpin if you have a tendency to call out reviewers for being too nitpicky or whatever then you re not gonna like this review i won t blame you for leaving now it s just not a review for you believe me i m going to give this game the credit i feel it deserves but if you are asking for a review of paper mario the origami king you re gonna get a review of paper mario the origami king with all that said i guess there s nothing to it but to get started let s get the most obvious thing out of the way first paper mario the origami king is a stunningly beautiful game and considering the direction the series has been taking this does not come as a surprise the first three games weren t so much about paper as they were about characters that happened to be flat then sticker star began leaning hard into the idea of a paper world color splash perfected the idea and now origami king expands upon it by giving us bigger and more unique areas once again everything is made of paper with color splash i heard it argued many times that the paper world was distracting because it was just so much paper and the paper thing isn t why we fell in love with the series etc while i will admit that that s true to an extent and it can get a little tiring thanks to the greater focus on paper throughout the rest of the game which we ll talk about later when i take it as it is it s hard for me to find fault in it the execution is just so wonderful because it s not just about being papery it s about art design and that s one area the game soars the realistic textures the little details that make it look like actual paper that s not the only reason the game looks great it s how these areas are constructed it s the visually rich scenery it s the vibrant colors it s how alive the world looks this is the most visually grand and spectacular paper mario by a country mile and these wide open areas and scenic vistas are always a treat in fact there are even some visual elements that are lifted up by the paper aesthetic it s clear that a tremendous amount of care went into how clouds and water look and the result is as beautiful as i could ever hope for i feel like any other kind of style wouldn t have had the same effect i mean you re playing a game about little paper people yet you can still get this very grandiose vibe from it because of these detailsthe overall feel of the game is lifted up tremendously by the interconnected world i actually hate that i m praising this element seeing as it was the series standard set all the way back on the n and if it hadn t taken them three games to ditch the new world map i wouldn t even bother mentioning the fact that the world is connectedbut it is indeed my job to compare this game to its predecessors to some degree to help inform the purchasing decisions of series fans so mention it i shall it feels genuinely good to have a real world againto feel like you re exploring one big place instead of a series of dozens of smaller places with severe limitations on what you might find and collect within them i will say that it does feel a little linear at times a good chunk of the game s major areas are kind of strung together in a line but even in this case it still manages to make a really big difference narrativelyalso making a big difference is the inclusion of wide open areas which is i feel the one single genuinely good idea here that actually expands upon what was already good about the series you know likehow you re supposed to do like a bunch with like your whole game augh sorry harsh stuff comes later i m talking about something i like right now seriously though these areas are a breath of fresh air that really help to change up the game s pacing they kind of ramp up slowly first with a grassy field then the desert with its several connected areas then the ocean which is positively gigantic and has a ton of stuff to find they each bring a very fun element of exploration as well as a simple satisfaction that comes from traveling across a wide area very quickly mario normally runs pretty slowly so it s just a fun new mode of gameplay to help change things up and to the skeptics who still insist that origami king s world is just as shallow as the previous two worlds you are dead wrong on top of being more seamless the game brings back the idea of towns that npc s actually live in are they filled with unique races no they re the standard mario fare and the towns aren t massive or anything but these races have also never had towns in any other games so this is something new and interesting within the mario world and having towns at all is another thing that makes a massive difference when it comes to the game s narrative feel i mean having toad town back is terrific it s decently big it looks great and i love how the population sort of fills out as you rescue toads which we will of course talk about later it beats port prisma by a wide margin i tell ya that much on both topics of presentation and narrative feel one of the best things about origami king is how cinematic it can be because of its more open environments comprised of alld assets the devs were given much more camera control than in the first two games this extra flexibility is utilized wonderfully having such a dynamic camera does wonders for comedic effect and in building tension or excitement cutscenes are so cinematic and cool that sometimes it s hard to believe i m playing a paper mario game the game even throws in some prerendered cutscenes which look amazing and are integrated almost seamlessly apart from the transition from paper to realistic water that s a bit oddand beyond cutscenes the game features some gameplay sequences that are just terrific chase sequences make a return from color splash but this time they re way less frustrating when you die they no longer send you all the way back to the title screen which was monumentally silly and i feel like they re all just tricky enough to add tension but easy enough that i didn t die a bunch of times and lose all my momentum and visually they re an absolute treat some of them are legitimately epic and stand out as some of my favorite moments in the entire seriesthere s a lot of other stuff to love about the visual elements too you ve got beauty and you ve got narrative feel but you ve also got that charm and cleverness we ve all come to expect from these games cranked up higher than ever i am positively amazed by all the different folding animations with all the origami and all the paper manipulation the game indulges in discovering all the ways that toads have been folded and hidden is a delight npcs interact with each other in hilarious ways every area is packed with an immense amount of clever little details and the confetti it looks amazing i feel like they must have hired a team of fifty programmers and theoretical physicists to make the confetti look this good the way it s thrown the way it all flutters to the ground the way it fills in these holes in the world i ll talk about the mechanic more later but golly gosh it just feels good nintendo has always been amazing at making an action feel good it s that crazy level of polish that very few companies are able or even willing to aim for and it s very much present in origami king tossing a bunch of confetti into the air and watching it fall never stops feeling awesome hitting a toad with your hammer and watching it unfold is a reward in itself the way your hammer crumples on anything you hit is justaugh it feels good even the way mario runs around feels goodand that s because feel isn t just about the animation but the sound design as well it s a marrying of the two to make something that for whatever reason sends pleasurable feedback to our brains when we perform certain actions and the sound design here is simply superb the effects are silly and fun when they need to be and scratchy and papery other times this helps to sell the world and all of its themes so well the music is good too though i don t think i like it as much as most people seem to there are some fun themes in there but not a lot that really jump out at me it mostly just feels like it works it s all fitting but not very memorable and it way too often uses distortion guitars in a very generic rock kinda way i don t think that style really fits paper marionot even new paper mario before we move on from the game s presentation i should mention that the graphics are great but sometimes the image can be a smidge jaggy for my liking a higher resolution or some sort of antialiasing would have been appreciated in some cases and also while talking about the world i might as well get collectibles out of the way origami king offers a very large number of things to collect all of it goes in the museum in toad town naturally there are loads and loads o toads in the world which are always fun to track down and they even give you toad points which can be used to purchase art from a very large gallery the next major collectible is these little statuettes which represent just about every character and notable object in the game they re all over the place and are fun to browse through and look at up close then there s a bestiary of sorts to fill out with all the baddies you fight you ve got achievements to earn and probably other stuff that i m forgetting all in all if you find yourself enjoying the world enough to explore it the devs have given you a load of stuff to do you re encouraged to comb every single nook and cranny of the map if that sounds fun to you i already talked about cutscenes and exciting sequences but what i want to talk about now is how they tie into the story i ve spent a lot of time criticizing things kensuke tanabe has said about the game in interviews but one thing i can actually sort of get behind is his new approach to story with sticker star miyamoto asked him does it even need a story and the result of that was a game with basically zero story but since then he s doubled down on a new sort of philosophy the story shouldn t be what is told to the player or acted out exclusively in cutscenes it should be the meaningful experiences that the player has instead of watching characters advance the plot and provide exposition in multiple different places across the game world bouncing the focus back and forth between themselves and mario now it s these fun sequences that make up the plot when you describe what you did in any given play session you re going to be describing all the fun and exciting and often just plain absurd situations you got into like you re telling a story while personally i do prefer a deeper plot with all the side characters and stuff i can appreciate the purity in this new philosophy if i m honest with myself it feels more in line with the spirit of mario we ll talk about creative limitations in a bit don t you worry but this is an example of one limitation that actually challenges the designers to do more with what they have and make sure every moment of the game is interesting i might not be singing the same tune if they hadn t pulled it off but pull it off they did the story as told through its varied sequences and scenarios is engaging enough that i rarely have time to miss the more complex plots of yesteryearand of course the story is just that much more effective thanks to the game s cast of characters this is another area where i see some people being stubborn for no good reason hey this is coming from a guy who will probably spend the rest of his life harshly criticizing these games and wishing nintendo would go back to the good ol days these characters are terrific because the plot is less complex and because of the rotating nature of your allies you don t get to know many of them as well as you might like but the characterization itself is there in full force yeah they re still not usually allowed to have real names nor are they allowed to look too different again we ll get there soon but there are multiple toad characters with unique personalities and the allies you gain are all very fun they re wellwritten they re interesting sometimes they have backtories and motivations they re everything you could want in paper mario characters and i hate to admit this most often i find myself annoyed by the obligatory companion character and the whole cutesy timid isabellekinda schtick normally does not do it for me but darn iti love olivia she s this optimistic but easilyfrightened little thing seeing the world for the first time thanks to her commentary you get to experience the whole game as though through the eyes of a child and it s incredibly endearing like if this game sold more and enough people learned about olivia i m pretty sure she would get a big following she s adorable and absolutely hilarious just about all of the characters are hilarious this is easily the funniest paper mario game since thousand year door color splash was also really funny but it did feel a little overwhelming at times it was often a little too jokey lots of memey referency internet generationy kinda stuff it felt like they had to fill every moment with a joke even if it wasn t particularly good but origami king smooths everything out it no longer feels like the toads are the spirits of twitter users shoved into toad bodies the humor is a lot more genuine more tonally appropriate more consistent in quality and you would think one way to fix the humor would be to ease up on the whole joke every moment thing but no this game is still a constant stream of jokes but it all pauses when necessary and somehow despite the sheer volume of gags and oneliners it s all really really good they must have had a heck of a good team of writers because this game is written like a good comedy show where the jokes are constant and somehow it all lands i m tellin ya i lost track of how many times the game made me laugh out loudstraight up guffaw and yet despite being a cutesy funny game about paper it s got the emotional moments we ve all been missing from the series as well the game isn t afraid to go some places i did not anticipate and i ve got to give it credit for that even though if i m completely honestit kinda feels forced a little i know that s going to sound super pessimistic can t you be happy about something arlo i mean i could be wrong maybe this just happens to be the exact story they wanted to tell us but because of other elements of the game i can t help but feel like maybe they re just throwing us a bone with this sappy stuff there were some sequences i really wanted to invest myself in but it all felt a little manufactured to me and like it didn t quite earn what it was going for i don t know i could be wrong and despite my nitpickery i m incredibly happy that the team was willing to bring a little more depth to the series considering the direction they took with some of its other elements sigh yeah i guess we ve come to it i ve spent a lot of time praising the game but it s all downhill from here and we can t stay away from the creativity issue any longer i m not going to go into the entire thing i ve done other videos on the subject but basically kensuke tanabe has gone on record saying that the team has strict creative limitations when it comes to the series characters and enemies they re not allowed to alter the appearances of the standard mushroom kingdom races beyond some bits of clothing i guess and they re not allowed to create new races that actually work within the mario universe just as we ve observed for years paper mario has become a snapshot of the classic mainline d mario games there is part of me that can kind of see the reasoning as with focusing on memorable events rather than complex plot you could argue that sticking with standard mario characters is a way to maintain the purity of the series the accessible even nostalgic simplicity it s one of those ideas that probably makes sense to an executive on paper and honestly if the first few games never existed i have to wonder if we would care so much about all of this so i try to look at it with an open mind from different perspectives and yet at the end of the day i can t see these strict creative limitations as anything but a bad thing having some small restrictions makes sense that s how you work with any world within a creative work but they took it too far even before tanabe told us about the line they re not allowed to cross we could see it we saw it in sticker star we saw it in color splash and now we can see that line running through the entirety of origami king you can clearly see the artists and scenario writers pushing against that line banging their heads on it smashing up against it as hard as possible to wring every single possibility out of what they re allowed to do well we re not allowed to create cool creatures ah unless they re origami creatures perfect oh but we can t make up new characters with names and stuff okay so we ll give the best personalities to stationary because they exist outside of the universe so it s okay do you remember when nintendo revealed bobby and everyone was just so happy that they gave him a name yeah guess what it s not even his name he says his name is bobbomb just like all the other bobombs and olivia only calls him bobby because she forgets his real name because he s not allowed to have a real name literally not allowed and they could only make him unique by taking away his fuse nothing else it s like an entire character created from loopholes it s like these restrictions are laws and the team had to figure out how to skirt around them to deliver something at least somewhat close to the experience they probably knew we wanted a game should feel like a cohesive creative experience but this game feels like its fighting with itselflet s not even consider how foolish this is from a business standpoint in a world where people fall in love with characters and that love can act as free marketing and even go on to drive future sales that s a discussion for another day even within this game all on its own this is awkward it s weird and baffling to witness if you ve ever played video games before you ve probably come to expect that games with stories have characters and those characters are unique and have names and stuff because that s what a character is i have played video games before and when i play origami king i m constantly watching the designers and writers bump their heads against that line and being likeokay but why why do you make a connected world with towns and stuff to make it all feel more real but then you don t bother letting your characters be characters because that would make themtoo real what is that these are two very different design philosophies that are very much at odds with each other and the thing about that line is that it s moved over the years sticker star was generic mario to the nth degree not a shred of originality to be found then color splash loosened up a bit in terms of what kinds of characters they could work with and how those characters could be altered and the game was substantially better for it now origami king has moved the line even more and i should be happy about that the creative restrictions are looser than ever in this modern paper mario and it makes the game stand so far above the others and i should be jumping for joy about it but it only makes me more frustrated with many games and series you ll get a pretty good range of opinions and paper mario is no exception and yet if there is one single thing that of the fanbase agrees on it s that creativity and variety are only good things practically everybody dislikes generic characters and wants more unique ones the general consensus is that on a creative level sticker star was bad color splash was a lot better and origami king is the best of the three the vast majority of players enjoy paper mario more and more the further away that creative line is placed that is an objective fact so why can t nintendo see that why do they have to take these baby steps between games sometimes i can enjoy origami king s good parts for what they are but all the while i can t help but see how awkwardly they skirt that line and i have to wonder how amazing the game might have been if the line wasn t there you re supposed to judge a game based on what it is instead of what it could be right well i can t it is simply impossible for me to permanently shut off the part of my brain that wants more because i ve gotten more from not only the earlier paper mario games but from you know like video games in general it s a standard set by the entire industry games with stories have characters characters are supposed to be unique the more creative a game the better when i hear we re not allowed to go past this line i really hear we re not allowed to make the game that fun because that s essentially what it means that s what that creative line amounts to while i play i see these great ideas stop short and i have to wonder who is making these decisions who is setting that line tanabe miyamoto some mysterious ip protection team and if they re willing to move the line from game to game that means they re admitting that moving the line is a good thing and if they re willing to admit that moving the line and loosening up on restrictions is a good thing and they can even see how people enjoy it when the line is moved then why is there a line if you can clearly see that moving the line is benefiting your games why are you so slow to move it honestly it s exhausting i try to just enjoy what s there without thinking about it too much but that s not how brains work most of the time and it s not how memories and experience work i m playing a game in a series that used to be creatively satisfying and now it s not and i m constantly reminded of all the ridiculous rules set in place to hold the world back and it s exhausting sometimes when the game gives me something good it feels less like a victory and more like the game throwing me a little bone so i ll shut up you want unique characters here s a bobomb without a fuse he doesnt have a name but you can pretend like its bobby or something if you ll quit buggin me be quiet and eat your dinner and on the subject of limitations i m sure not everyone is going to feel this way specifically but i feel like the focus on paper actually hurts my enjoyment of the story itself in the last two games the paper focus was more annoying than anything because it became the entire focus at the expense of any real satisfying story but this time origami king does have that story it s exciting it s fun and the final chapter is really quite epic and now i m finding that the paper thing isn t as innocuous as i once thought immersion is big for me i become the most invested in worlds that are completely unique not grounded in our reality at all beyond some simple similarities i want a world to feel real and alive origami king s mushroom kingdom ticks those boxes it s big it s connected it s got people living in towns it s got characters it references the history that mario and bowser and peach all share but it and all of its inhabitants are also explicitly made of paper real literal paper and they never let you forget that fact the characters worry about getting torn and soggy there are holes in the world and we can see the wireframe underneath stationary is the most dangerous thing in the world because of how it can manipulate paper but where did that stationary come from who made this world is it supposed to be like an imagination world or something a child s daydream i don t know beyond gags i don t actually know why nintendo leans on paper so hard as a selling point it s not that interesting it s not nearly as enjoyable an element as the idea of a consistent connected mario world filled with characters and story that s the selling point or at least it used to be for me being so grounded in the real world is exactly why paper ultimately harms the story it s hard for me to fully connect with the world when i don t even understand it or why it exists and i keep imagining that there are humans somewhere making all of this even in the game s most emotional or epic moments there s always that little voice in the back of my mind that s like yeah butthey re just paper they re not even real i m fighting a stinkin stapler for pete s sake this is dumb i try to get into the plot and i remember that the bad guyis origami like the bad thing you fight isn t an ancient demon or a diabolical villain with crazy magic powersbut the concept of origami it s a bad guy who has origami and he makes it do bad things at you it is hard for me to care about origami i mean it s cool and everything butit s origami as an antagonistic force it s really lame there s no immersion it s paper none of it can feel nearly as cool as it s supposed to when it s all just real literal humanproduced paper breaking immersion is why it hurts the experience and yet we know that that immersion breakage is exactly why it was allowed in the first place they can only use concepts that specifically don t work within the mario universe breaking immersion is literally their mandate i m sorry but i cannot see the logic there purposefully harming your game by creating a world that doesnt work with itself i just cant wrap my head around the idea i mentioned the idea that it feels like they re just throwing us a bone sometimes and that might sound like i m overthinking things and looking at the whole thing with too bitter a perspective but you know what i probably wouldn t have thought that if i didn t see it happening in other areas of the game too the badge mechanic was one that added strategy and depth to the first two games and it s been sorely missed ever since on the surface origami king looks like it brings the mechanic back you can get accessories and equip them to give mario some perks butthe selection is very minimal and you can only select a limited number of accessories from each category the leftmost category for instance is only for health boosts in battle and each one you get is simply better than the last so there s no strategy there you equip the best one you ve got some of these force you to actually choose something at the expense of another thing butnone of these are a big deal it s like the diet version of the idea of badges a tiny fraction of the idea that doesn t amount to much is it better than absolutely nothing i guess so but it does feel like they re willing to admit that the badge system had some merit yet they re only willing to toss it back in as an afterthought you want badges ugh fine here s a tiny handful of them uh thanks it s the same thing with quoteunquote partners the topic of partners has been one of the biggest sore spots in recent years in the first few games they injected the experiences with creativity added richness to the story and brought strategic depth to the combat i mean they were the whole shebang one could argue that they best represent what the original games used to be and what the new games have been missing and when the marketing material for origami king showed characters following mario around and talked about making allies people were ecstatic they thought this was the definitive return of partners to paper mario i was extremely skeptical and people gave me a hard time for it but if i may indulge i was rightnot every chapter introduces a companion and each one is only with you during their respective chapter in a small way i can see how maybe this allows for some unique creative opportunities these characters are around long enough to help with the story and they can have a solid arc that wraps up when you leave the area it s sort of an interesting narrative idea but they still manage to disappoint in other ways only one of them grants you an ability to use on the overworld only one better than nothing sure but from a design standpoint it would be less weird to just have none the inconsistency feels so strange and yeah they technically help you in combat they re technically there standing next to you as you fight or as you capture conveniently vague marketing material for your game but you want to know how useful they are the extent of their abilities yeah if a turn ends and you haven t defeated every enemy yet your partner will automatically do a little attack it smoderately helpful sometimes if a couple guys happened to get away from you and it s like oh look i don t have to do another turn cool and that s it what was even the point of having them in battles did they do it just to get us to stop complaining about partners you want partners fine here s your partners look see they follow you around they stand next to you in battle boom partners what more could you possibly want don t be entitled i mean it s possible that instead of trying to appease us just enough they re actually legitimately trying to give us what we want but don t quite understand it but that s too hard for me to believe they know exactly what we want every last bit of it tanabe said he heard the feedback it takes a great understanding of the whole situation a great understanding of the whole series and all of its mechanics to so carefullyso methodically choose exactly what to give us and what to hold back and by how much these partners feel like a very calculated bonethrowing to me alright we can t put it off any longer we did the creativity thing and now it s time to talk about the game s combat i ve been preparing myself for this for months just in case you need a little context here s a brief recap i felt that color splash s combat was way too convoluted it took way too long to choose and select and paint and play your cards so even very simple battles against easy enemies were a chore i also felt that the combat was way too easy seeing as you could just throw any random cards at your enemies in most cases and things would turn out fine having all of your attacks tied to disposable cards was frustrating because it felt wasteful but then the game threw so many cards and coins at you that there was no semblance of difficulty balance to be found and of course battling didn t reward you with anything but more cards and coins and running from enemies removed them meaning that running was a quicker more efficient way of beating enemies than fighting them it was a system that actively discouraged me from engaging with the game s combat system which was completely backwards so going into origami king is combat worth doing was my number one biggest question forget the story and the characters and the connected world and all that for a minute despite popular belief as anyone who watched my videos on the game knows i actually thought color splash was a really really good game in most areas but it was the combat that dragged it down to an almost unbearable level for me it basically ruined the entire game so yeah once again this was something that could make or break the experience and i was very nervous about it going in and thus the time has finally come to answer that question does origami king fix the mistakes of its modern predecessors is the combat actually worth something this time well i wish i could give you a clear cut answer but it s kind of complicated as i said near the beginning origami king is certainly worth playing and that s not something i could say about color splash i say save yourself the headache and just watch an lp for that one origami king it isn t entirely ruined by its combat system and yet in ways i m even more frustrated with it than i ever was with the combat in sticker star and color splash it doesn t destroy the game entirely but it does drag it way deep down into the mud for the sake of simplicity let s talk about the ring system first and go from there because everything stems from the ring system this ring is my single biggest problem with origami king on the surface it seems fairly innocuous at first maybe kinda fun at like the absolute worst but remember this is a review where i do not hold back and if i have a feeling i say the feeling and i feel that this little ring thing is a monument to stubbornness it is the embodiment of the idea that nothing is more important than new and that gimmicks trump intuitive design it perfectly represents why paper mario is what it is today seem a little overdramatic a bit too harsh well you knew what you were signin up for when you started watchin so basically the whole point of the ring system is that you ve got to rotate and slide these spaces around to line up your enemies for better attacks you have a limited number of moves and if you line everyone up you get an attack bonus from there you can choose your attack and your targets twobytwo groups can be hit with the hammer straight lines can be jumped on i am pleased to report that disposable attacks in the same vein as stickers and cards are gone different kinds of jump and hammer attacks are now equippable weapons they do break over time but it s nothing like it was before and you ve always got a basic boot and hammer that never break boom that s one problem straight up fixed this right here the concept of selecting what to attack and with what move is the best paper mario combat has felt in a very long time it s basic and intuitive yet offers the potential for some kind of actual strategy so then what s the problem arlo well i say potential for strategy because this is not the entirety of the combat you also have that ring part that came before it which is the actual combat this right here the attacking part nah not important get that outta here it s aaaaallllll about the ring and the ring does everything in its power to harm the rest of the experience the ring by itself is a little fun like simply as a puzzle mechanic it s a little fun to move stuff around and it does feel good to work out a particularly tricky problem there s a nice little chunk of satisfaction that comes from doing it the issue with that satisfaction is that it has nothing to do with the game i m playing beating solitaire is fun too but at the moment i m trying to play a mario game and fight some guys on a narrative level it s frustrating because it doesn t make any sense at all other paper mario games you re in a fight you re taking turns because it s more like a fight simulation slowed down in order to be more strategic your attacks represent real attacks that the character can do that s the whole point of turnbased combat in any game but what does this ring represent why is it with you no matter where you go what is mario actually doing when he moves guys around call that a nitpick if you will but i feel these kinds of questions are always worth asking and if a player ends up asking them angrily something isn t quite rightand then of course mechanically it s frustrating for a great number of reasons like i said it can feel good to solve a puzzle but that good feeling is entirely isolated from the rest of the combat it should feel good to line up all the baddies and get an attack bonus so you can lay into them but it s not because it s all too easy to see how this system impacts the battle design and overall difficulty you always have one move for each group of baddies and if you line them up and use strong enough weapons you will wipe them all out that strategic potential with the weapons out the window none of it matters if you do the puzzle you take them all out at the absolute worst you don t do enough damage on the first attack and it takes two but it s always one or two because that s how the ring system is supposed to work it s supposed to reward your puzzle solving skills with easier simpler battles thus creating a combat system that is at its best easy and simple okay so what happens if you don t do the puzzle correctly couldn t you just ignore the ring part for a greater challenge not really see whoever created this ring system was faced with a dilemma solving the puzzle rewards the player so failing it should punish them right but they recognized the puzzles as a barrier to entry and knew that if the punishment was too harsh then some players would become frustrated and quit so at that point instead of letting this dilemma clue them in that maybe their system was flawed they decided to go with the blandest least committal option failing the puzzle isn t really a big deal it just wastes more of your time when you mess up you might have a lot of enemies left over if they all attacked you every time that would be too hard right so instead like some of them attack you and the game decides how many so they can keep a handle on the difficulty at any given time there s no real way to know how they re going to do it or how many of them will get together or how much damage they ll do they just kind of awkwardly throw themselves at you a little and of course when you re on leftover enemy cleanup duty the attacking part is a lot more tedious because you ve got to initiate these attacks on individual enemies and the whole thing feels really artificial and lame it feels like because of this system where if you do the puzzle you don t even have to fight and if you don t the enemies can t do a lot to you because that would feel too frustrating the designers have come to another wrongest conclusion possible and made all the enemies nearly identical i mean there is very little in the way of enemy variety a few of them bring some sort of little twist like the boos disappear but most of the time they re just guys you re supposed to take out all at once or that attack you awkwardly and do a couple points of damage their attacks are all so samey yet the specifics change up so much and you cycle through enemy types so quickly that memorizing attack patterns in order to block them isn t really a thing you just kind of guess or keep mashing the button and hope you get lucky not a lot of strategy there and again choosing different weapons doesn t do much at all have they got spikes use metal boots instead of regular ones are they flying use a hurlhammer or don t because i never did that s pretty much the extent of the game s strategy element you don t need to know your enemy s attack patterns you don t need to know how much hp they have you don t need to worry about selecting just the right attack none of the numbers really mean anything it all comes down to did you do the whole puzzle and then do you have a weapon strong enough to take them out in one hit if the answer is yes to both of those questions there is no battlejust a puzzle if either of them is no then it will take an extra turn or two and that s the combat i ll admit right now i am pretty darn bad at these puzzles and a fair amount of my frustration comes from there i can handle two moves most times but when they go up to three it can take a mighty effort i m not the sharpest taco on the christmas tree i m sure there are people out there who are great at this and yet i can t help but feel like this is going to be a big deal breaker for a lot of others this would be a terrific game for kids and yet i can never recommend it to any parents because of how tricky these puzzles can be also even when i can solve a puzzle the only real reward is not being frustrated yeah it s satisfying to solve a puzzle just for the sake of solving a puzzle i like puzzles fine but in the context of battle the absolute best i can expect from these puzzles is me not getting annoyed not getting frustrated that i wasted my time that s the best thing these ring puzzles donot get in the way too much be fun though ha what s fun we don t have fun here why have fun when you can have something new wow i really am going hard on this game there s actually so much more to say about the combat system and i am overwhelmed by the idea of conveying it all properly but i shall try the frustration that comes with fumbling over tricky puzzles when you re just trying to stomp some goombas is alleviated somewhat by a number of features you can spend coins to buy yourself extra time to think and believe me this takes a loooooot of coins you can burn through a ton if you let yourself but then on top of that you can throw money at the toads in the crowd they ll do some of the ring moves for you and refill your health depending on how much you give them and this is where the final semblance of difficulty balance goes out the window if it s a three move puzzle give them five hundred coins and they ll solve two moves the final move is always a nobrainer essentially meaning that for five hundred coins you can solve any puzzle and solving any puzzle means winning any battle without much effortwhen it comes to difficulty in games i prefer clear boundaries i like to have separate difficulty modes to choose from sometimes nintendo will include easier options that aren t necessarily modes like the special boxes that appear in super mario d world and d land when you die enough times the powerups are for people who need a lot of extra help it s not a separate mode but it s removed enough from the main experience that it s easy for me to ignore but it s not easy for me to ignore this toad thing as the player it is my goal to figure out the most efficient way to play a game i want to maximize damage output and resource income naturally this toad thing is the best way to play you probably won t end up making any money from the fight but you can t put a price on saved time i don t like how easy it makes the game but then i remember that the alternative is sitting through a bunch of tedious puzzles which i don t want to do so i am once again discouraged from interacting with a game the way it was intended tanabe mentioned in an interview that these coin spending options were for casual players but if your easy mode essentially removes the mechanic all togetherwhat does that say about your mechanic easy modes and special suits and such in other mario games still require a player to play the game but when your entire combat system is based on an all or nothing mechanic where doing the puzzle lets you not fight letting a player not even do the puzzle makes me wonder what the point of your game even is having these failsafes makes me wonder if you even thought the ring idea was good in the first place i said this about the fact that you could beat enemies by running from them in color splash a game that already had combat with almost no reward i was pleased that i wasn t being forced to engage in a combat system i thought was cumbersome and boring but i was also annoyed that the devs would be so uncommitted to their ideas that you could just skim over an entire facet of the game and there would be no harm done and i m feeling the same thing here i m glad they ve given me a way to circumvent the annoying mechanic they ve created and yet i m almost more annoyed that they have so little conviction about their design it feels like by giving us these easier options they re almost admitting that their system has serious problems don t agree yet well let me tell you about the final helpful option the designers have given us when solving a puzzle at any point you can hit the x button and ask olivia for tips and no the help doesn t come from the tips themselves the help comes from the fact that the game pauses and while it s paused you have a nice view of the whole map buying time giving money to toads why do any of that when you can justpressx just press x imagine you re playing breath of the wild and every time you pause time stops and you can keep moving and you can kill every monster like this and there s no penalty whatsoever it s like god mode just built right into the pause menu that s pretty much what s going on here is this another feature i m supposed to just ignore even though it s right there in front of me all the time surely this wasn t a mistake on their part i refuse to believe they could miss such a detail so then what s the alternative were they really so uncommitted to their system of trying to solve a puzzle within a time limit that they had to come up with every way possible for the player to get around it it s like whoever came up with the idea pushed it into the game making a lot of sacrifices to the game s enjoyability along the way and they knew the ring was great because the ring was new and it was a puzzle and it had to work so they pushed alllll the way to the endbut at the very last second the rational voice way in the back of their mind was like wait hold on this could actually destroy the game completely so that person was forced to be like okay well maybe we can make it optional but when everything is optional nothing feels necessary so once again we find ourselves with a combat system that is more convoluted than it needs to be oversimplifies what could have been engaging mechanics and in the end doesn t feel super necessary however i will admit that despite a combat system that is perhaps even more frustrating in concept the combat incentive issue isn t quite as bad as it was in color splash first off running from battle has a much lower success rate this time and because there are so many enemies to rush you every time you fail usually it s less aggravating just to engage i should be annoyed that i m not able to run as much yet from a design perspective i m glad that literally avoiding combat entirely is no longer the best option on top of that origami king has way more scripted battles that you literally can t run from situations where baddies will pop up unexpectedly or attack you in a cutscene again i should be annoyed that i have to battle them and yet when they re actually blocking my progress i gain some satisfaction from taking them out it s easier to engage with the whole system when i actually have to and simply running isn t an option at all then of course there are the rewards you get for battling which is one of those concepts that can make or break the whole thing even a boring battle can feel a little better if you know you re going to get something for it count the wood panels on the side of your house sounds like a pretty boring job five bucks heck yeah i ll do it the paper mario team refuses to bring back anything along the lines of xp so this time coins and confetti were their attempt to make up for it and really this isn t such a bad idea on its own it doesn t really matter what it is as long as it helps you out and encourages you to battle in order to get more so do coins and confetti act as sufficient incentive to battle random enemies yyyyyyes and nookay well when it comes to confetti it s a straight no confetti is all over the place and you can farm it all you want way later in the game there are like a couple places where it s a little scarce but i never feel like it s a precious resource filling holes is satisfying in its own way and some of these holes block your progressbut in the end having a confetti limit does nothing for the rest of the game they could have elected to make confetti a finite resource and make enemies the best way to get it thus giving us a satisfying collection system and a solid reason to battle random enemies but they didn t i don t know why they didn t i spent a good amount of my time brainstorming better ways to handle the confetti system but i guess they didn t wanna they wanted it to mean very little kay greatbut what about the coins well this is where they were on to something you earn a lot of coins in this game but stuff also costs a lot of coins accessories don t impact the game too dramatically as i said but it is pretty fun to spend your coins on them other random costs come up throughout the story as well and there will probably be times when you re looking at something you can t afford and suddenly you want to go out and get yourself some more cash money you can indeed make a good chunk of money from a battleas long as you don t spend any on time or toads or fail to do a puzzle or get hit at all it s another thing that doesn t really fix the battle issue but does help at least somewhat later in the game especially you can bring in some good numbers from a wellfought or rather well puzzled battle so there s a little incentive there you ll find a lot more money on the overworld though there are many many ways to get coins and the problem is that if you want coins to feel worth something you ve got to stop yourself from trying too hard to get them just like i said it s my instinct to find out the best way to make money and do it a bunch but if you do that it won t be long before that feeling of worth goes down the tubes after the roshambo temples in color splash i knew there would be some economy destroying mini game in origami king and i was not wrong if you make a decent effort collecting the stuff then eventually you will indeed reach a point where you ve got so many coins it doesn t feel like they matter much anymore and at that point the issue of weapon breakage is also a thing of the past because you can just buy all the weapons you want you can only find the absolute best stuff out on the field but you ll never really need more than you get and this sort of summarizes the overall issues the game has with balancing there is no balance to anything if something is hard just spend money to get around it if a resource is limited just take any amount of time to actively pursue that resource and everything s good if you want any sort of actual challenge you ve got to come up with some kind of strict string of rules and limitations for yourself with all these little options they included maybe they thought they were making a game for everybody but to me it feels like it ended up being for nobody the puzzles are too hard for casual players and the rest of combat is too easy for more experienced ones it s like they just threw everything they could at the wall and whatever sticks eh that s good enough let the players create their own challenge forget any sort of balance to the game s difficulty or economy or anything that s not the game designer s job what are you talking about so far i ve just been talking about regular battles but boss battles are a whole thing of their own and honestly i m kind of torn on them they re sort of on the verge of offering the challenge and strategy i crave here the ring system moves the same way but you interact with it very differently you have to use these arrows to make a course for mario to follow you can collect powerups along the way and you have to land on the right spots to perform the right actions since there s no one correct answer at any given time it all comes down to your individual strategy toads can t make any moves for you and this can be pretty tricky again there is something satisfying about getting it right and moving mario along this crazy long path and picking up a bunch of stuff and doing just what you need to do these battles also have a lot of very fun animations they re pretty exciting at times and the stationary bosses are each unique with a lot of personality every boss has some clever way that they alter the board and force you to rethink your strategy it s obvious that a good amount of thought went into each boss encounter and i actually came a little close to dying a couple times on bosses unfortunately these battles still fall into a lot of the same old pitfalls along with some new ones toads might not make moves for you but they can refill your health instantly whenever you want so i didn t really come close to dying also you can still press x to pause everything and take all the time you need planning your strategy soyeah but the biggest problem with these battles is that they re long convoluted and don t clearly convey what you re supposed to do the boss battles in sticker star and color splash lacked any real challenge because of the thing system you couldn t beat a boss unless you had just the right thing to attack them with sometimes the answers were very obtuse and it could be a chore trying to figure out what to use if you used the right thing you would incapacitate the boss entirely and wipe them out no problem it was an all or nothing system that compromised the satisfaction of the very act of battling an enemy and wow am i starting to see a pattern here origami king does away with things and i ve seen a lot of people celebrate that factand yet i feel like they re still here in spirit the game is just more subtle about the process now every boss has specific weaknesses makes sense some of these weaknesses need to be opened up by exploiting other weaknesses still makes sense but it s the execution that s lacking there s obviously some logic to some of these battles but it can still take a ton of trial and error to do what you need all the major attacks against bosses are done using these elemental powers and the thousand fold arms you ll try to use what seems like it might work only for the attack to fail and for olivia to be like no you can t do that yet you ve got to do this other thing first then you ll do that other thing and she ll be like you can t do that from that angle or when he s doing this attack and it s constantly like this constantly telling you no that won t work this other thing will you did this too soon you used the right element but at the wrong time no don t hit it with your arms that just makes things worse you ve got to hit it with your hammer from behind i guess even though the arms should theoretically work too but they don t for some reason but now hit it with your arms i ve decided that now is the time and the whole time the boss is pummeling you giving the illusion that this is a tough enemy when it s really not at all it s just that it s a stupid convoluted process to get a chance to perform one proper attack on the thing and sure there are these little envelopes with tips in them on the board and they can help sometimes but most of the time they just don t help enough or you can t find a path that leads you past one before it s too late and you ve already messed up and here s the thing im all for trial and error and learning how a boss works thats how lots of games do it but each of these actions each thing you try that s a whole turn sometimes that s entire minutes you had to spend staring at the board dumping thousands of coins into it if you re not into cheating just to hit a wall and have the game go buzz wrong answer try again later even worse these necessary magic circles they re almost never activated right off the bat you ve got to hit this on button to turn them on and there s only one on the board at a time and when you use a circle they all turn off and you have to hit the button again aaaaand of the time the button will be hidden in a chest so you ve got to spend a turn getting it out all those turns to set up the right attacks all those turns figuring out what the right attacks even are each one with a ring puzzle that can take whole minutes under the right circumstances and muddling this whole process up even more the basic mechanics of the board are not clear at first you ve just got to try and fail some stupidly basic stuff which would be fine under normal circumstances because that s how you learn by failing but it s not fun to learn by failing when the stakes are this high wasting an entire turn that you meticulously planned out and missing the attack opportunity you ve spent multiple turns building up to because the game never told you exactly how this whole system works that s messed up you ll be in situations where you re looking at the board and wondering if the arrows are going to work the way you want or if mario is going to land on the right spot or if a certain attack is going to work at a certain distance and you won t know for sure until you just do it your basic attacks work differently in boss battles than they do in regular ones and range can affect things in ways you don t expect and you ve just got to figure it all out as you goand all of this combined makes for some truly exhausting boss battles some of them are no problem they re actually ridiculously easy but then others can inexplicably take ages to complete and there were a few times where they put me into a state of mind that if you ask me means someone has committed a cardinal sin of game design sometimes when one too many attacks fail and the boss still has so much hp left i reach the i want to go home point you ve been there before i don t like this ride anymore i want to get off i just wanna stop plenty of bad games can present frustrating mechanics that make a player want to quit but there s something even more disturbing when an otherwise good game does this i want to be playing this game i want to see what happens in the story i want to explore the rest of this area i want to have some fun but i am absolutely stuck in this situation and it s going to take a lot of effort and mental energy that i am rapidly running out of to get through it it s a miserable feeling but that s what the ring does it forces you to engage with a system that is directly at odds with what you re trying to do it constantly grinds the game to an absolute halt which just about destroys the pacing and makes me actively worry about hitting the next i want to go home moment reaching a boss should always be an exciting thing in any game but here they only fill me with dread again it s not like every single boss encounter is a bad one there were a couple of times where i didn t have to do too much trial and error and i was able to figure out my moves quickly enough and the pace went along at a pretty good clip but those few pleasant moments were not worth the rest of the times i still look at every boss and go why do i have to go around these dumb rings what is causing that why can t mario just run up to the boss why does this have to take so long why are you making me do puzzles when i m trying to fight a guy and you want to know what makes this battle system even harder to swallow because yeah this rabbit hole goes deeper this is baffling to me the game itself presents you with a better alternative to it that it simply chooses not to use most of the time see for whatever reason that s not really explained in addition to origami guys there are big paper macho guys very clever they only exist on the overworld and you ve just got to run up and hit them with your hammer to hurt them this is quite a lot of fun mario s range is pretty short and he s a slow runner so landing hits can be a little awkward at times but it s still a blast it s empowering it s exciting it s visually spectacular it s entirely intuitive and it utilizes the incredible tactile feel of the game at first i was just like hey that was pretty cool but as the game goes on you start fighting bigger and bigger paper macho enemies and some of them are like full bosses on their own these are the absolute best enemy encounters in the entire game they re these delightful little bursts of fun and they act as a direct contrast to the slow sluggish ring combat i can t help but ask myself the obvious question why isn t the whole game like this imagine if you could use coins and confetti to gain new combat abilities what if you could use the thousand fold arms to swing your hammer around to fight these giant baddies that would be so cool why does the funnest combat in the game take up such a teeny fraction of the play time why is it i can just run up and hit these guys but everyone else does the whole ring thing why doesn t the game actually realize what s fun why don t they take this opportunity to give the series a new identity that actually works and that truly anyone can enjoy they keep trying to tell us that this isn t an rpg it s an action adventure so here you go this is the alternative you ve been looking for this is different enough that we won t bother you about rpg stuff anymore we ll look at it as its own thing no you just want to do this with some battles you re keeping the ring they re keepin the sigh okay thanksbecause of all of these game modes being so at odds with each other i can t stress enough how messed up the game s pacing is as well as the dichotomy of fun every time i m moving around freely on the overworld exploring and solving environmental puzzles i m having a great time the overworld design is just delightful and every time i m forced to stare at another ring puzzle the fun comes to a screeching stop and battles can be bad enough when you re already feeling annoyed but there are some specific sequences that are misery incarnate later in the game there s this whole sequence of mini games that would be fun if they didn t force you to answer questions using rings and figure out problems using rings and put together pictures that have been all shuffled around into impossible nonsense and you only have thirty seconds and you can t buy any time and this is the tenth minigame in a row you ve lost and you just want to go home but you can t you re stuck in this game and if you want to continue you ve got to keep going you ve got to do more ring puzzles more more more there s one very important encounter in the game that s super epic super exciting you ve got to do this realtime actiony sequence and your blood is pumping and you re feeling strong and awesome and it lasts a couple minutes before guess what now you ve got to put a picture back together and you can t buy time and if you take too long you get a game over and have to start all over and every few seconds you re interrupted by an attack you have to dodge it s one of the most exciting moments of the game and that too just had to put everything on pause while you work through a tedious puzzle thus destroying your momentum because we came up with the ring system and we re going to stick it wherever we can dog gone it because it s the new thing and even when it s completely at odds with everything else the game is trying to do we will force it in and speaking of forced mechanics that don t do anything to lift up the game are you wondering why i haven t really talked about confetti and the thousand fold arms much it s because they re nothing mechanics if there s a hole blocking your path fill it in with confetti done again confetti doesn t feel really limited so it essentially costs you nothing to throw it it feels good like i said it s certainly enjoyable in a visual sort of way but it doesn t do much then the thousand fold arms stand on the magic circle find the grabby spot and pull it that s all of it that s the mechanic the game constantly gives you prompts telling you what to do and which way to pull which removes the small amount of fun potential this might have had you don t have to figure out how to move something you don t use it to manipulate puzzles or anything you justgrab and pull can t move forward stand on circle grab and pull puzzle solved having to beat an enemy first or find the circle is as far as the excitement goes at first i was really annoyed by this mechanic because the motion controls are janky and awful but then i realized that you can turn off the motion controls and just use a stick and button which upgraded it to benign thanks for the failsafe guys so in the end it s just another paperrelated mechanic that acts like it s really important it s a part of the game s very identity it s in all the trailers and in all the official art and yetit s nothing it doesn t even make narrative sense like there s no good inworld explanation for why it even happens it serves some purpose in boss battles it can be a nice flashy finisher but outside of battles it s nothing it feels like it s something that they included simply because paper and because new when i decided to give this review the overly long and critical branding i remembered that i used one word to sum up the entire pokemon sword and shield experience and that i could do the same thing again here it was rather serendipitous actually because even before i d made the decision on the title i had a word in mind as i said before i could be completely wrong about this game s design decisions and the motivations behind its biggest decisionmakers but the feel i get from origami king it feels like a project driven more than anything byego is it tanabe s ego tabata s ego miyamoto s someone else s ego that we don t even know about and everyone is just following orders and doing the best they can with what they re allowed i don t know i will admit that this feeling has been colored by the interviews done with some of these people but i don t really want to point fingers at individuals whether it was one person or many it does feel like some sort of ego got in the way of making the game it s this weird stubbornness this unwillingness to actively pursue what s working with your game and what s not working literally everyone wants a more creative world too bad the right person decided that we have to have these arbitrary limitations paper mechanics that don t accomplish much of anything keep em in it s more important to have paperthemed stuff than it is to have a consistent experience a battle system that s so convoluted you ve got to put in a bunch of failsafes so people don t even have to engage with it most of the time if they don t want to most important part of the game the only reason it exists everyone complained about not having any incentive to battle two games in a row let s do the bare minimum to fix that a teeny tiny bit we ll never use anything that resembles an xp system though because that would make this an rpg and it can t be an rpg because someone at nintendo with a great big ego decided that the game not being an rpg was more important than it being fun and well designedi ve said it before about color splash and i ll say it again about origami king it would not take much to make battles feel completely worth doing which would dramatically improve the game without even touching the precious ring mechanic you could use systems that are already in place the game gives you special hearts that permanently increase your max hp sometimes you can find them or earn them which is cool but most of the big ones come at arbitrary points in the story like they just threw them all around because they couldn t think of a better place for them and these hearts help you instantly defeat enemies on the overworld with a first strike olivia specifically mentions how you re getting stronger after each one which comes across as really awkward then beyond that after you beat every major boss your max confetti increases so how about having a simple xp system like in the old games where when you gain a level you can choose between hp max confetti and base attack and defense stats or something just a little tiny something to give you some sort of sense of progression and incentive to battle heck don t even use xp just use coins like you ve already got make it so you have to buy all these stat increases with your coins no break it down even more get rid of everything but the special hearts and have them acquirable through battles in at least some way even if the hearts were the entirety of the progression system that could still work the more you fight the more hp you have and the less you have to bother with smaller enemies that s a perfectly good incentive in fact that would work so well that it almost feels like the hearts were actually designed to be part of a progression system but they had to make sure to give them to you unexpectedly and not as a reward for battling just so no one could say this is an rpg call me a conspiracy theorist if you will but it feels like more of that awkward sidestepping bending the game to fit a ruleset that makes no sense to anyone battles only give you coins end of story they can be useful but not as much as you d like people have different opinions and i try to make it clear that my opinions really are just opinions but i m willing to go out on a limb and say that the way they have it now is objectively poor game design if you have a progression system and you have turnbased rpgstyle combat marrying the two is how you motivate and empower the player bringing back some form of xpor even something vaguely similarisn t something they should do just because it s the way it used to be but because it s a superior way to do it they did it before because it was a good way to do it they avoid it now because doing it the old way is against the rules even if the new way is just worse a lot of people have accused me and of course most other quote thousand year door fans as we re now called for clinging to the past and being unable to let the series change and enjoy it as its own new thing but that s not true you know who s actually having a hard time letting go the people who make paper mario i m all for accepting modern paper mario as its own uniquely fun thing but it s not its own thing it s still imitating the games that came before it the paper mario series is different now it should be taken as a different series okay then why does it still use the exact same visual style and general combat mechanics and name it s an action adventure game not an rpg okay then why is there still turn based combat if it wants to break away so much then why doesn t it do it it s already full of dungeons and puzzles and stuff like a zelda game so why didn t they just make all the combat real time why do they claim to want to leave the old games behind entirely yet they keep inching closer and closer to them in terms of world and story why do they tease us with stuff that s like badges and partners but not quite and in this weird mix of old and new why does it feel like only the old stuff works and most of the new stuff just gets in the waypeople say it s not fair to compare origami king to the old games but it s absolutely fair if the development team can t consider modern paper mario its own new thing i m not going to either if you want to do something completely different make a new series but this is a paper mario game the old games presented me with mechanics that were crafted to deliver a consistently engaging experience origami king presents me with alternatives that don t feel very well thought out it doesn t feel like an action adventure game it feels like an rpg gone wrong no that s not nostalgia no that s not stubbornness on my part it s just how video games works it s how design works it s how genres work and honestly even without the old games to compare it to i will argue to the bitter end that origami king is an absolute mess in terms of designit s got aaaaalll these problems and the whole time i m playing i m coming up with little ways they could balance things out i ve mentioned multiple here s another one i mentioned how the thousand fold arms don t amount to much because you just stand on a magic circle and do it and it s done i also mentioned how the game presents confetti as something you might run out of but then gives you all you ever need which is a wasted opportunity okay so how about the thousand fold arms use up confetti then if you combine this with my other idea if confetti was just a little more scarce and mostly only found in battles all at once you ve given the player a reason to battle made confetti feel more valuable given a more solid narrative reason for mario s arms to get big sometimes and put a limitation on the ability to make using it feel a little more impactful four problems fixed in one go teeny tiny changes to the game we already have but identifying and fixing problems was not on the agenda at nintendo when they made origami king and that idea baffles me to no end i myself am an aspiring game designer and i ve spent many an hour ironing out mechanics tweaking them studying how they work together scrapping entire ideas that i was once in love with because they had some flaw i couldn t work out or they didn t mesh with the rest of the mechanics i see this in tiny little lowbudget indie games i see people who are only just starting out on their own working really hard to carefully craft and balance their games because how the player interacts with your game and how all your mechanics work together is the foundation of game designbut not when nintendo s working on paper mario apparently those questions that even the most inexperienced game designers are asking themselves well nintendo with all its legendary studios and designers spending tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars working on a aaa game based on its absolute most treasured ip can t be bothered it s a family game right it s for kids or something so who cares and i find that disturbing very very disturbing it s frustrating not only as a paper mario fan who wants a better game but also as an aspiring developer who will absolutely never have the same budget and properties nintendo doesthe same opportunity to make a mindblowing game based on a treasured character in a series that used to be treasured itself i spent a lot of time praising origami king and that s because it s got so much good stuff going for it in ways it even outshines the precious thousand year door and the bad stuff isn t quite as bad as it used to be or at least it s a little better at keeping me just engaged enough to not quit so i should just be happy that we ve finally got a paper mario game that s worth playing but i m sorry i m not in fact the closer paper mario gets to what i m looking for the more frustrating it is that they re not letting it be the series it wants to be the more tantalizingly close the experience gets to being great the more painful it is to see it all brought down by these awful design decisions the highs are higher but that just brings you crashing down harder than ever this game honestly had the potential to be one of my favorite games of all time it could have been everything as beloved as the original games it could have been better but making an incredible game that would go on to become a classic and live forever in the hearts of millionsjust not what nintendo wanted to do they wanted to do something new they wanted to make it about paper they didn t want to think too hard about how to make the game great because in the end that wasn t as important as catering to the almighty ego just to make even more people mad i once thought that star fox zero represented everything bad about nintendo i felt that the level design ranged from serviceable to awful the presentation was only okay the recycled story was a huge missed opportunity and on top of everything it forced me to use a gimmick that ruined what was already a mediocre experience it was every bit of nintendo ignorance rolled into onebut now i feel that origami king best represents nintendo s bad side nintendo has got a legion of extremely talented developers at their disposal and they often put out games of extremely high quality the likes of which you won t find anywhere else in the industry they know what they re doing a lot of the time yet they have a lot of serious issues origami king s ring system represents how they too often pursue newness rather than fun its lack of difficulty balancing represents how they sometimes dumb games down in a fumbling attempt to make them accessible its arbitrary creative limitations represent nintendo s hesitance to be too imaginative with their legacy ips for fear of compromising nostalgia factor the dichotomy of quality that runs through the entire game represents how they re so so great at what they do and yet there s so often something really dumb holding them back from making eternal masterpieces and completely dominating the industry throughout the whole experience i could see some very talented designers actively fighting against the creative limitations and the poorly implemented mechanics and that inconsistency represents the corporate culture nintendo has been trapped in for decades where senior staff members harm or even destroy entire projects because of their flights of fancy and there s no accountability system in place on a companywide level leading to a game output that is also very inconsistent the mulish heeldigging refusal to listen to what millions of fans want instead leaning even harder into concepts that have been almost universally panned and have led to extremely poor pr and by extension sales represents their tendency to make objectively poor business decisionswhy the ego is all i can think of there can t be another reason youre a big corporation making money is your number one job everyone wants something you did that thing before and when you did it led to the most critical acclaim and the greatest sales success when considering attach rates more people have since then been exposed to that thing and are hungry to have it again considering modern tastes and trends that thing would resonate with people more than ever and potentially lead to a massive expansion of your series you have the experience and the skill necessary to give it to the people who are screaming for it you have a whole team at your disposal that is eager to deliver it and you justdon twanna i am making a product with the goal of people buying it and i am deciding that what those people want doesn t matter it takes a very big ego to make a decision like that and because of that ego whoever it belonged to paper mario the origami king is an okay game i enjoyed the experience most when i just sort of shut my brain off and tried not to think too hard about anything even then frustration always crept in eventually because there s only so much i can ignore in the future i m sure i m going to look back on some of the stuff in the game and think oh man what an amazing experience i ve got to play origami king again as i do with many of nintendo s games that even today stand the test of time and are enjoyable again and again and again but then i ll think about it for another moment and remember oh yeahthat means i would have to like play origami king again and i will probably change my mind it was absolutely worth playing once but after this i ll probably just save myself the time and skim through an lp for the good parts and that s the best we can get from nintendo when it comes to paper mario apparently that s the best we re allowed to have we have good enough to buy technically good for a lot of it good if you just shut your brain off and not think about it too much good for what it is great quite the legacy this company s got good to see it being upheld playbugfables well there you have it i know my opinion is not in the majority most people who play origami king seem to like it just fine and as always i must reiterate that i respect those peoples opinions but whatever the majority opinion might be however people might respond to all this i ve got to stay true to myself this game made me feel a lot of things and i have now said all of those things to you soit is what it is if you stuck with me through the whole video i thank you from the bottom of my heart and i hope you found it at least somewhat enjoyable at this point i am much too exhausted to come up with a good outro joke so all i ll say ishave a good one love youuuu,0.0

me because we need a little controversy and it be so empty without me im about to say something that may prove controversial and yet brave thelma is bad so you have chosen death yeah film is bad guys in case you havent heard that news already oh yes this channel is home to only the most unpopular and spicy of opinions say the line tj velma bad yeah but its hardly unjustified and its been a long time coming initial announcements for this series were met with a great deal of skepticism its trailers had a reception about as popular as a bill cosby combat tour and upon release velmas reception by critics and audiences is perhaps one of the worst ive seen for any mainstream release when ign only gives it a out of and it isnt a video game that theyre too incompetent to play you know somethings up it united people across the political spectrum who either saw it as too woke or too regressive and created an online personalities fell over themselves to produce scathing reviews and parados its a dumpster fire thats been as entertaining to witness as elon musks takeover of twitter velma is currently the lowest rated animated series on imdb as well as being the third lowest rated television series of all time and these two things are oneoff programs so velma does take the title on a technicality and this is after only two months of existence even these possibly fake reviews couldnt save it bit of an oof moment in general really now ive watched a lot of bad stuff in my time ive seen animated projects that were cobbled together by one guy that you could point to and say yeah this is objectively worse than velma but without any exaggeration i think velma might be the worst viewing experience ive ever had both as a general audience member and as someone who has to melt their brain with this stuff regularly in order to pay my extortionate energy bills britains doing fine by the way thanks for asking but how exactly did we get here the short answer of course is that its terrible velma fails to achieve anything that its set out to achieve and theres not a single aspect in which it could be called successful except for one goal which you should never have attempted in the first place and youve probably heard that from everyone and their mother at this point but theres a lot of contributing factors and reasons to explain this failure and id like to take a deeper look at the colossal mess that is velma because you know me i love this i love this so so much im just gonna say it here before we go any further dont watch this show sometimes i will say that maybe you should check out whatever it is that im talking about and make up your own mind and we all love a good ironic watch but in this case not only is it not worth the brain rot but hate watching is exactly what the creators want ill talk about this a bit more later but yeah for now just dont do it also some of these topics are going to overlap with each other a bit and while i did try to avoid repetition in this script youll have to forgive me where it wasnt possible and im not going to hold back on spoilers but youre not gonna watch it so it doesnt matter right you yeah you you there theres always one isnt there but where to begin this epic saga well perhaps with a gang music the scoobydoo franchise dates all the way back to and follows the adventures of a gang of teenage sluice called mystery incorporated as they travel around in their mystery machine solving mysteries and trying not to get drafted for vietnam at least thats what i choose to believe the gang of meddling kids consists of all american leading man fred the dangerprone eye candy daphne the intelligent but clumsy nerd velma the cowardly and all but confirmed hippie stoner shaggy and the iconic talking great dane himself scoobydoo typically the gang investigates a supernatural mystery like a monster or ghost thats wreaking havoc in the neighborhood splitting up to search for clues and inevitably encountering the monster along the way before realizing its a hoax and capturing the suspect with an elaborate trap unmasking the dastardly villain at the end its success inspired numerous successor seriess spinoffs movies comic books tiein products and of course incalculable amounts of porn if you grew up in a western country youve probably seen at least one iteration of scoobydoo at least once im not going to pretend to be overly familiar with all the different versions of scoobydoo that were released over the years but the original series was a staple of my childhood i had most of it on vhs tapes remember those kids and i dont know how they didnt wear down for me watching them so much and im sure that watching the hex girls and linda cardellini as velma probably awaken something in me thats all im going to say about that the franchise has had its ups and downs for sure and theyve even poked fun at that themselves wow i havent seen look away daphne we all promised each other that we would never speak of him not ever but despite the years and occasional drops in quality scoobydoo still maintains a fairly large and passionate fan base who appreciate it not only for nostalgic reasons but also for its humor like he went through the wall nonstop its a franchise which with some exceptions has been able to remain entertaining and endearing it seems to be generally agreed by most fans that the best series is mystery incorporated which ran from to and featured a longrunning story arc provided more depth to its characters and added more relationship drama and darker elements it also acknowledged its source material occasionally poking fun at it while still respecting and building upon it i havent seen all of it but if youre gonna watch any version of scoobydoo this is the one id recommend who the heck can that be music okay applause eventually ownership of scoobydoo would pass to warner brothers discovery which owns hbo which brings us to the worst iteration of this franchise what if a cartoon said fart no no hear me out what if uh a cartoon now one of the cartoons said fart no youre just repeating yourself okay okay okay what if uhhuh a cartoon yeah said big farts velma is the brainchild of writer charlie grandy known for his work on the office and saturday night live and the comedian mindy kaling also known for her time on the office various other film and voice roles and for creating shows such as the mindy project on which grandy also served as a writer the idea was originally kalings and it seems clear that they were more interested in making an adult animated comedy first and a scoobydoo show second which explains a great deal what we first wanted it we knew that we wanted to do an adult animated show and it felt like these are high schoolers we love the velma character shes always been so smart so brave and now its like lets raise the stakes they both claim to be fans of the scoobydoo franchise and so the idea of an adultoriented origin story for its characters fit in with the type of project they already wanted to make i started i have i work with warner brothers and ive never done an animation before and so its really exciting to see the entire canon of hannah barbera cartoons that they have and i i obviously big fan of scoobydoo was raised watching almost every iteration of it and really loved the character of velma and i said to charlie like would you have any interest in doing something that told her origin story and he was into it yeah yeah i instantly said yes i mean ive always loved animation particularly adult animation so it just combined a bunch of uh sort of ideas that i wanted to pursue into one project it was just fantastic and thus we have velma which seeks to tell the story of how mr incorporated came to be while offering a more adult interpretation of the franchise and its characters your spide ascent should already be tingling because this has been done before well sort of shows like college humor robot chicken and family guy have all featured adult parodies of scoobydoo oh youre right scoob were dealing with one sick son of a and darker interpretations of its characters is an idea thats been mean to over the past few decades there was even a blair witch project parody produced by cartoon network the scoobydoo project and it isnt just parodies there are projects like the unofficial fan series mystery incorporated which also seeks to tell a more realistic origin story and there was even that rrated version of the liveaction film that james gunn never got to make unfortunately my point is that while it may not have been the basis for any standalone series before velma at least not that im aware of the idea of a more adult take on scoobydoo isnt exactly fresh and original and as studios try to replicate the success of shows like south park and rick and morty the genre of adult animation has already long been saturated to hell with countless examples of cheaply produced unfunny trek so when somebody says they want to make an adult animation about scoobydoo your first thought is probably oh god how much is this one going to make me want to commit super cool its also incredibly unnecessary what i loved about the original scoobydoo was the mix of horror and humor and so it was like okay how can i create a version of scoobydoo like of that gang that is funny and scary in a way that i would appreciate and adults might appreciate but loads of adults already appreciate scoobydoo for what it is you dont need to consciously make it more adult in order to appeal to older audiences and there are plenty of examples of content that may not be specifically catered to adults but nevertheless can be enjoyed by them and thereby cultivate a grownup audience of its own not only is it unnecessary but they also went about making it more adult in probably the worst way that they could have ill talk about the other aspects of this approach later but by far the most important one i think is that the creators seem to believe that in order to make the show adult they had to make everything about it miserable everything in velma sucks and not just in terms its poor quality i dont think ive ever seen a show so openly hostile to its own ip and its characters its own audience or even itself velma oozes with an unjustifiably harsh cynicism towards all of these and a meanspirited bitterness pervades the entire show its like they looked at other shows that were dark and gritty reimaginings of ips and thought that they had to do the same while also removing any warmth in humanity that allows its audience to stay grounded and justifies them sticking around basically they went too far and ended up not being compelling but instead repulsive and nowhere is this more prevalent than in the title character herself oh that was horrible youre horrible what took you so long idiot my name is velma dinkley this is my story told my way kaling and grande decided that this show would be an opportunity to bring of all the gang velma to the forefront heres a gang that was already assembled at its you know at its center is this young girl whos like so brilliant and sort of not traditional looking for a lot of other cartoons and i was like lets give her lets make her the front and center like mystery solver and all this ah heres this girl whos sort of a smart one does all of the work doesnt get nearly enough credit im not sure what these people are smoking i would ask for some but i dont think even that would have helped me through this but as far as im aware velma definitely never did all the work and she definitely got credit she was never any more of a comedic punching bag or went underappreciated more than say shaggy despite jokes about her losing her glasses or having to deal with shaggy being a crappy boyfriend and mr incorporated she was always considered a highly valuable member of the group and the whole point is that she was part of a group that sold mysteries together no member of the group should be brought to the forefront because without each other its not scoobydoo of course the real reason why the show centers around velma is because shes played by kaling which itself wouldnt be an issue but this velma is a very obvious selfinsert for kaling herself but when but when mindy came to me said i want to do this you connected with the character saying ah heres this girl whos sort of a smart smart one does all of the work doesnt get nearly enough credit so you connected on that level so then when weve got glasses short hair yeah yeah shes often spoken about how much she identified with the character of velma from a young age growing up i just was one of the only people around the animated character i could really identify with you know shes obviously not indian but shes i felt like she was like you know like really pretty but in an untraditional way like super smart and unafraid of being smart um big big thick glasses which like obviously i can identify with and uh so when you know i started working with warner brothers animation and they had this whole catalog of the hannah barbera cartoons she was the first one that i thought wow that would be really interesting to find out about her origin story more evidence for this is the decision to match the characters ethnicity to that of kalings we had a conversation or like okay well velmas white and we have this new choice to do the show and if im voicing her should she be white or should we be not again i identify so much as her character and i think so many people do so we just said like yeah lets make her indian in this series oh okay i can already predict how the uh the youtube comments are gonna go so ill talk about the race swapping aspect a bit later so save your spicy comments until then you you naughty naughty boys if you still dont believe me kaling has already developed a reputation for inserting herself into her creations in some form one noticeable trend in her work is featuring nerdy indian girls who have a crush on arrogant white guys and very often her love interests are white men so guess what happens in velma oh yeah well well get to that and for those who want to point out that she isnt credited as a cocreator or as a writer and use that to excuse her its far from uncommon especially in comedy for lead actors to play a significant role in the creative process without actually being credited for it hell a significant portion of the judd apatow movies were entirely improvised by the cast and based on what this velma says and does and the fact that kaling is an executive producer on the show i find it utterly inconceivable that she had no creative role whatsoever now selfinsert characters arent inherently bad and can be used to good effect and its far from uncommon for creators to put parts of their own personalities into their characters but theres a difference between a cameo or autobiographical inspiration and blatantly inserting yourself into a work and then having its whole world revolve around you which is the case here and its especially distasteful when you do this with an existing character that already has a fan base at that point you cant just treat them as your play thing and its nothing short of arrogant to force your own opinions and mindset into such a character and then claim that youre doing them justice especially when you say how much youre honored to voice a character even when youre the one who created the show you cast yourself you dont get to say stuff like this velma immediately struck a lot of people myself included as being a brazen vanity project for its lead and no one likes vanity projects except the vain people who make them by the way this is a small percentage of people but it really made me think like okay we gotta be really careful with this character which we will be because we really love her yes have great adventures and were they careful with this character boys and girls were they i can safely say that this velma is perhaps the single most loathsome annoying irritating unfunny and uncharismatic protagonist in any piece of media i have ever consumed its a genuine wonder how they thought any viewer would want to identify with her or get invested in her story never have i screamed shut the up at the screen more than while i was watching this show and never have i wanted to punch a character in the face so much and shes not even the villain shes the main character around which the whole show revolves a mystery incorporated velma was sassy but in a way that was still endearing and didnt go too overboard when a garrison of spanish conquistadors mysteriously vanished from the harbor oh that is so scary where do they go what part of the word mystery didnt you understand and its certainly possible for a character to be sarcastic or negative but still likeable except here theyve confused being sassy with just insulting people so she comes across as incredibly mean not now velma this is real estate championship really its not the entertainment at a virgin convention shes not sassy shes just a dick and thats putting it mildly she constantly insults everyone around her velma thats not fair im not just a waitress im also a basic who doesnt even know how to use hashtags shes incredibly judgmental despite being an absolutely no position to judge others what are you crazy finding fred innocent would require me to admit id incorrectly prejudge someone she often displays a deepseated insecurity towards those who are more popular and conventionally attractive than her brenda wait did you climb in my locker to prove how skinny you are again oh we get it this is despite her refusing to do anything about her own body or selfesteem issues then i have to eat a whole pie to feel better and i will die before i give that up whats another way to cure daddy issues she body shames other people but anyone who body shames her is portrayed as a bad person especially from a student who is in no danger from a hot girl murderer the occasional selfdeprecation doesnt make up for this person whos ever found me irreplaceable this is so extreme that it results in sociopathic levels of callousness and cruelty but then the outcropping started to break off and there are weight your weight please legally both of you should still be in car seats who the says something like that in this situation not once does she ever express any sympathy for the other students who are brutally murdered by a serial killer and she makes a point of rubbing it into their friend who for all she knows might be mourning and scared that shell be next what do you want vermin just to offer my sincerest condolences for the loss of your more popular friends that you picked over me what a charmer if you hadnt already gathered she is an immensely toxic person shes narcissistic for starters the ego on this girl is unbelievable my criminal parents also abandoned me like i was a puppy after quarantine im sorry but is that bigger than no no youre right a good friend would been there for you even if your thing wasnt worse than her thing she has to make everything about herself and be the center of attention regardless of how appropriate it is in that situation yeah i have won how come no one ever cared this much about my missing mom im just spitballing here but it might be because multiple young women have been found brutally murdered whereas your mum just went out to get some milk why would you market her as having main character energy you do realize thats not a good thing to have right with one possible exception everything she does in this show is for her own selfish gain and she pursues it regardless of the negative consequences for those around her she treats her best friend like trash and is just using him for her own gain up look gigi and i have decided that maybe i should spend less time with you less time but i only see you when i need you as is shes ungrateful but when it comes to truly crappy parents no one beats my dad i think joseph fritzer would like a word you think your life is hard shes condescending its the one call to the registrar and voila its pronounced viola you idiot and thats an orchestra thing shes controlling daphne daphne what have i told you about texting during my times of need shes manipulative and norville in light of the recent revelation i take advantage of you i couldnt expect you to do this for me so oh well i guess my house will just get destroyed she seemingly has no control of her impulses or emotions and shes hypocritical and lacks any sense of selfawareness wait until you see how much pizza i eat i can eat three slices yeah right now youre throwing stones from the worlds fattest glass house her list of sins is longer than the list of celebrities who went to epsteins island but heres a few of her more noteworthy calamities before we move on she steals daphnes diary and starts reading out all of her personal to the entire school and then makes fun of her for going to therapy somehow thinking that she has the moral high ground she fakes having a panic attack in order to prevent daphne from spending time taking sexy pictures with a hot girl because shes jealous and at the very end of the season its revealed that the villain is freds mum who then gets brutally crushed to death velmas reaction to this is to start twerking because all she can think about is how she solved the mystery not an ounce of care that the other teenagers just saw someone violently unlifed or that fred just saw his mother get game ended right in front of him honestly this image is just the whole show in a nutshell and theyve made her disgusting but not in a way thats funny or enhances her character in some way sophie told me i cant pee in the shower anymore because thats where she bathes amanda now i have to pee in the shower at school like a weirdo its very transparently an attempt to make us laugh at her for being such a disgusting slob but i hate this character so much that when shes humiliated or made fun of whether by herself or others i dont care it isnt funny its just sad and pathetic it isnt cathartic its just sickening its like yeah we know youre a disgusting skid mark of a person now go away now this may be hard to believe but i was never that popular gee i wonder why and would you believe it it gets even worse you see velma has a lot of opinions a lot of very annoying opinions you know that sjw like raging feminist stereotype you know the ones who let the side down by just being obnoxious idiots well velma would make even those people cringe its not that im happy right but are you having a baby or did society tell you to have a baby are you having a stroke or did society tell you to be a idiot i thought santa ink was bad in terms of putting certain opinions on your face but holy nothing ive ever seen comes even remotely close to this level of insufferable politicizing theres a serial killer on the loose in the town of crystal cove and the police deduced that the killer is only targeting hot women so they decide to figure out who the hottest girls are and assigned protection squads to them velma of course objects couple of middleaged white dudes are going to decide which of us are hottest note that her objection is not to the police only protecting a few women and leaving the rest at the killers mercy its to whos doing the judging okay well if you have a better idea how to make the list maybe you should do it velma you want me to make the list id rather die for some unfathomable reason they decide to let her write the list instead which she reluctantly does but she about it the entire time this is exactly the problem with this list men make everything about them and what they want you literally did this in the presentation scene three minutes ago and its literally what youre doing with this list unlike the most offputting of this type of person shes hypocritical about her beliefs our whole lives girls are told by guys theres a right way to be hot and im not it guys even teach us to be ashamed of our own bodies shes body shamed multiple people by this point in the story every little kid knows how to draw a penis but make a little kid draw a vagina and what happens oh also penises are way easier and funnier to draw everyone knows that its not that deep she cheats and gets fred to make the list becca and kimmy but kimmys so sweet wait is it an inner beauty thing because a girl whos nice cant also be hot what is that supposed to mean of course if society exerted half this effort teaching girls not to be slaves to the patriarchy we wouldnt have this problem in the first place she must be an absolute riot at childrens parties rather than wasting police money on protection details they task her with making the hot girls unattractive like her wait so youre saying i get to actually release these girls from the shackles of the male gays exactly because women cant possibly want to look a certain way just for themselves for their own selfesteem it has to be that pesky patriarchy but youre more than your looks olive you can reverse your car without even looking at the camera i know velma just like i know i love looking hot this is of course slot shaming and shes called out for it this wasnt an exercise in deprogramming its an exercise in shaming no woman should ever have to change who she is or how she dresses to not be murdered you think every girl deep down is like you but youre wrong in fact your definition of womanhood is even more restrictive than ours this is one of the shows better moments and it leads to a brief crisis of conscience its just that after yesterday i have no clue how to be a woman in a way that doesnt judge other women at the end of the episode she accepts that both ways of being a woman are equally valid saying what world see asses im all sassing glasses baby but then a couple of episodes later shes right back to it proving she learned nothing at all velma what are you doing up there im doing what every girl is doing up here im just trying to get my dads attention she also has a huge chip on her shoulder about men and while there are legitimate issues in society to do with gender differences and so on that need a dressing she comes across like the most delusional manhating stereotype she goes to a festival dressed as a man and predictable joke since you oh my god that was amazing guys put zero pressure on you to wash your hands daphne and the hot girls now find her attractive which i refuse to believe since she looks like a depressed penny stock trader whose wife is the milkman wait a second as a guy everyone thinks my worst qualities as a girl are awesome you know what this is this is a blatant attempt to address criticism of this character that they knew theyd receive a common response to people not liking an unpleasant or irritating female character is well youd find them funny if they were a man which no we wouldnt in this case side note im really happy that buzzfeed is dying because this article is cancer also d from its always sunny in philadelphia is a great example of a female character who is a terrible human being but still popular with audiences so theres no excuse there holy crap no wonder men are so desperate to hold on to their power this is the easiest ever as a guy i can do anything i should point out that apart from a few sexist comments now and then theres no evidence whatsoever that her life has been made harder because shes a woman as opposed to her having the charisma of a toilet brush its embarrassing how hard she projects oh and then theres all the comments about white people why wouldnt he if i were a rich white dude id kill everybody just to get away with it of the time yes hey no offense but can we just let the actual doctor explain just being a white guy with a clipboard doesnt cut it anymore drugs here get your drugs here bart mark white girl with too much money white girl with too much money race was never mentioned why did you feel the need to bring it up enjoy your slow descent into organic farming losers im sure if somebody made jokes about her liking curry she wouldnt appreciate it very much music im not gonna do it im not gonna say it but im not im not gonna make a comment im not im not im not gonna do it i i am the better man wow i cant believe thats your mom i mean playing god removing brains thats some white people i guess velmas never heard about unit if you dont understand that reference dont look into it its a its its pretty gnarly god what um wow blondehaired people have bad days too what the are you talking about i feel like im back on tumblr in im just gonna say it this film is a racist theres no evs or bots or well actually is about it this character is a racist dont believe me im going to repeat a few things she says in the show but change the word white to jew all right i have to point out that none of this is delivered with even the slightest degree of charisma irony skill or insight that might make it redeemable instead were left with this freds a rich white guy with a tiny dong he did it this character is meant to be for the most part the morally superior one in this universe but she sucks but supposedly everyone else sucks more so its okay but it isnt i dont care about her backstory i dont care about what she wants i dont care about what happens to her i just want to see her take a oneway trip to the challenger deep hey you want to see something cool but even worse theyve taken this intelligent capable and beloved character and reduced her to the human equivalent of an anal fissure if i were a fan of this franchise id be absolutely fuming well excuse was me for having enormous flaws that i dont work on i mean that should be enough really the main character of the show the title character of this show is such a complete piece of rotting smegma that you have no reason to even want to see them fail that alone would kill any show straight up but it doesnt end there in fact weve barely even begun because of course velma isnt alone you wankers you total total wankers ive wasted my life hacking morons i hear you off off lets talk about fred jones i have a disease where i cant recognize people who arent hot my doctor says its basically sickle cell for rich guys its important to note that fred was the only member of the main cast who wasnt race swapped and it was for an incredibly bad faith reason yeah the whiteness of the characters was not it didnt feel integral to them except fred as we fred fred just felt like a very white person what does that even mean well apparently what it means is that fred who was a brave and natural leader for mr incorporated despite having failings and dumb moments of his own daphne now i need to talk to her daphnes gone call me crush on it lady im serious where is she is now a vain selfcentered stupid and incompetent rich boy crap im all syrupy bathies hes also incredibly sexist what was he doing there i dont know my dad told me never to pay attention to women over and hes also a racist because hey why not double down on this character assassination its velma from school you cheated off me in spanish because you think im mexican before you just started talking i thought you were a housekeeper philma give me the chance and i can help you with anything except filling in your ethnicity on a form im guessing samoan and despite having done absolutely nothing in the past to deserve this treatment fred is humiliated at every possible turn its not like previous installments didnt also make jokes at freds expense but there was still a fundamentally likable character to get attached to here its very evident that they just wanted to have a rich white man in the course that they could make jokes about and degrade whenever they got the chance fred is probably innocent yeah but isnt it a little comforting to see a rich white guy get wrongly convicted from once so naturally he has a tiny penis which they joke about multiple times because of course body shaming is okay when we do it but also that he was just another entitled rich guy who might kill someone because he has a tiny dong and the reason for this and his boyish good looks is because he hasnt gone through puberty yet which feels like a cheap thing to joke about while also pretending to be morally superior its also immensely hypocritical to try to use fred as a way to comment on and criticize toxic masculinity and then to continually make fun of his body and because hes a rich white guy with a small dick he has anger and entitlement issues although to be fair if someone had told an entire courthouse of people that i have a small dick id be id probably be pissed off as well it sucks even more because hes voiced by glenn howerton whos amazing and its always sunny in philadelphia and im just like man i hope you got paid well at least hey guys im fred jones vote for me for fog king or i will make it my lifes work to destroy you see if they just made him a lovable sociopath like dennis from its always sunny it could have been funny albeit still a terrible portrayal of fred brendas dead what no she was my plan b if you ever got too clingy what happened but humiliating him was more important i do miss my mom prison is cool but nobody watches me pee quite like mother wow and remember how i said that kayling is into white guys perhaps weirdly so yeah gentlemen he came in the show and we had to do this flashback sequence where we were in bed together in college and were just supposed to be having a conversation but like hes so tall and hes so handsome that in the middle of it he was shes just supposed to be like what do you think mindy and i was like and that looked around and i improvised just kissing him in the scene which was not in the script its not you just went for it you just started kissing that guy that picture yeah just looming he was looming above me yeah and he asked me a question i was not listening to him at all because who cares what he was saying and i was just like and then and then he reacted like that and i pretend it didnt happen and then i walked backstage we have two writer producers um i can like baron helton davis dawson and they were like hey man what are you doing you could be sued for that and i got very scared uh and then i said um tell anyone and youre fired im sorry what the yeah so basically thats going to be happening a lot more now too because you got away with it so of course velma likes fred even though she hates him sorry fred but for what its worth i am keeping the picture you sent me for plane rides just so youre gonna masturbate to it dont even bother with euphemisms at this point and after she gives him a copy of the feminine mystique which reprograms his brain into being feminist so im sorry im really sake he starts liking her based on her inner beauty which also doesnt exist i wish i was making this up this is nothing short of fan fiction and a bad one at that its not like this hasnt been done before and also funnier all you care about are swimsuit models no look im a man of substance the dorky chicks like you turn me on too again none of this is funny or insightful or even original reducing fred to an angry bigoted rich small white guy with daddy issues is just insulting to this character and the fans that love him im just saying if white people are now the minorities on campus daphne i actually have the least to say about i say that but shes now a sarcastic violent high school with parental issues yay were your parents daphne my parents why are you so hairy wait glenn guys shes now asian and match our voice actress constance wu i mean i think traditionally daphnes always thought of as just the hot girl and usually the hot girl is the object not the subject i think its like oh its really nice to get to play somebody whos like used to be sort of thought of in that way and make her a real person you can only really say this about the og series in which yeah there wasnt a whole lot of depth to her character but iteration since then especially mr incorporated have done a lot to give her layers and flesh out her character further so no this was neither necessary nor original are you noticing a pattern yet and neither is showing daphne being physically tough even the live action movie did this more than years ago now whos the dams on distress straight up but i guess they just wanted to pat themselves on the back and make themselves feel important this daphne is one of the hot girls at school yeah real original interpretation there guys and a former friend of velma she also sells drugs because this is an adult show shes dating fred but also has feelings for velma oh yeah thats a whole thing in this show but well get there when we get there i wouldnt exactly say that shes likable but shes the most likable out of the main cast although its more accurate to say that shes the least detestable of the gang members she was the one whose character was butchered the least hence why i dont have a huge amount to say at this juncture but then theres shaggy or norville and look how they massacred my boy doesnt even come close to encapsulating it norville rogers more commonly known as shaggy has always been one of the primary comic relief characters of the gang although hes a lazy coward who would rather be eating and hanging out with his best body scoob than chasing ghosts hes hilarious endearing and a long time fan favorite so much so that hes the only regular character to appear in every version of scoobydoo but this norville is to shaggy what a bundle of tissue soaked in pisses to the sistine chapel lets go down im normal you are who i say you are hes velmas only friend not so secret admirer and reluctant assistant to her investigations hes no longer a coward as such and while you were out slaying he was studying the blade the shaggy power memes were already a thing and i think there could have been potential to build on these and make him hilariously overpowered one punch man style shame really its been a longrunning joke that shaggy is into drugs and although the creators denied that they ever meant to employ this its been an enduring meme im mary jane like that is my favorite name really yeah no way but here hes definitely not into drugs at all no sir he is straight edge for life i think it has something to do with drugs which i hate and i guess i can see the joke they were going for but it ends up not being nearly as funny as the unspoken implication that shaggy likes to blazer man if i ever even think about getting into culture or especially related humor kill me although since hes now black i can also see why they wouldnt want to embrace the black character as a stoner stereotype as is to be expected theres a lot of jokes at his expense and not in a lighthearted way as in previous iterations yeah take out a new pair of pants whats wrong with my pants you promised me you were going to start caring more about your appearance but i like these pants youve worn them since the eighth grade theyre comfortable pants look how pathetic this guy is please laugh kinda way my dad says therapy is in my blood i just got my mom to admit she never wanted kids this did lead to an unintentionally racist moment where they accidentally evoked the black men abandon their kids stereotype i mean of course how hard can watching it be right norville music ive been for college hes also completely emasculated and if i win norville does whatever i say forever and do i get to weigh in no velma points out that his dad has taught him how to be a beta male and that its lame this is after shes gone on many supposedly feminist rants i should point out so he decides to overcompensate by acting really alpha but they dont use this as an opportunity to criticize and ridicule the concept of alpha and beta males which would have made sense based on other things said in the show instead the entire joke is that he specifically is bad at it im out of here and i might be late for dinner dont pour my milk and when his dumbass attempts to imitate andrew tightly to his girlfriend almost dying he becomes beta again again not because being an alpha is bad but because he is bad at being one despite being a bit of a doofus shaggy was capable of having some game but norville not only lacks game but is really weird and actually quite horrible to his girlfriend also for what its worth daphne is technically harder you just have a mildly better personality music that yeah that thats a thing to say yeah that is certainly a thing you could say all right its embarrassing normal hows it embarrassing to be considered the second hottest girl in school well third of you throwing my mom the worst thing though is that he is a massive simp for velma i like you like like you wait what no you dont youre like a brother to me thats hilarious and yes they make so many jokes about this youre the main character in all my dreams okay stop im peeing if velma had an only fans hed be uploading contributes to her on pornhub and selling his organs to be a toptier donor in fact he does try to sell a kidney for her at one point but just so he can blackmail her into going on a date it very quickly stops being funny in fact it never is and goes straight to being sad any more simping for her were through gigi im not doing this because im simping for velma im simping or myself oh yeah but you cant feel sorry for him either because hes a nice guy tm men make everything about them and what they want not me im an ally now get back to my question someone who pretends to be nice in the hopes of getting laid and doesnt actually care and is therefore as much of a scumbag as the others no dont kiss me im already too confused kissing me would confuse you wait why this isnt about you right now just make me laugh like last time but a kiss might awaken passions weve been too scared to admit why did deprive ourselves that knowledge in fact his motivation to get velma to like him causes him to threaten to abandon daphne in a scary place by herself because he realizes he can no longer copy the parts of her personality that velma likes i hate danger so i cant mimic your personality to make velma like me yeah thats what ive been trying to do no trust me theres someone other than velma out there for you yeah sorry i cant do this dumb talk anymore im gonna have what what a standup guy the downgrade from what we had before just boggles the mind for all shaggys faults he was lovable norville can just right off into the sun but what about scoobydoo where is he we need some help from him now scooby himself isnt in this series aside from a few scattered references and easter eggs scooby scooby and wait what did scooby do there was a rumor going around that this character who becomes norvilles girlfriend was going to be the equivalent of scoobydoo in this show that turned out to be just misinformation and im glad the creators werent that stupid at least there were several reasons for this but bluntly warner brothers wouldnt let the dogs out so when were thinking about what show what makes an adult show that the dog spooky is what really seemed to we couldnt get a take on it yet that was like how do you kind of do this in a you know fun modern way that coincides up like what what made it a kid show was scoobydoo that coinciding with warner brothers animation saying hey you cant use the dog so youre like great warner brothers wouldnt let them use scooby and something adult that would tarnish the image of such a popular and beloved childrens character and the creators couldnt figure out how to integrate scooby into this adult animation anyway so it was convenient for them and i sort of get it what were they gonna do make him a grizzled traumatized former police dog who cant even talk because this is meant to be more realistic i dont think anybody would have wanted to see that although unironically if theyd made scooby the killer that would have been better than what we got i also take this as more proof that they wanted to make an adult animation first and a scoobydoo show second for me the biggest mystery of um scoobydoo just the the original is how can a dog die you know we cant have the dog from warner said we couldnt ever use it and that was okay because again like the dog is what rooted it as a kids show i dont know for me personally without scooby himself an essential part of the formula and gang dynamic is lacking to the extent that i would question why you would bother at all because it isnt scoobydoo at that point my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined and so the beloved mystery incorporated has been reduced to a gaggle of petty immature hypocritical obnoxious its been an unfortunate trend in recent times for iconic and adored characters to be mangled due to creative incompetence and ego but desecration of the characters to this extent should be considered a war crime punishable by defenestration you cant say things like and additionally we wanted to you know we love the original it really is a love letter to the original that honors the original show and really we want to just honor the original scooby as much as we can and then create something like this do you even hear the words that are coming out of your mouth and this lies at the very heart of why velma failed to be a scoobydoo show none of that warmth good humor gang banter adventurous spirit and group dynamic that fans love so much has been carried over because the creators didnt want it regardless of what they say theres simply no reason for fans to watch this any more than anyone would want to watch their beloved puppies stabbed strangled curb stomped and pissed on in front of them and what about the origin story angle well these characters are so far removed from what made the gang who they are that they simply arent even the same characters and your attempts to provide an origin story for them are simply moot because theyre not the same characters and they try and excuse this by saying yeah i mean its an origin story so that for me its always like how did they get from a to b so i think when you first meet the characters theyll be different than what you what youre used to but you stick with the series because you sort of see where youre going we drop easter eggs along the way and you know and so those moments when a character does something that um uh is sort of more identified with their original version its like ah okay now i now i get it no amount of character progression could make this velma into the velma we all know and love mad no im so excited now you have gigi to talk about boring stuff like your swords and feelings so when were together we can focus solely on finding my mom and youve made these characters utterly unwatchable why would i want to stick around ive got so many better things to do like see which of the bottles under my sink tastes the best what is a fan of this franchise supposed to do when presented with this how did you expect them to react whats a general audience supposed to do when you insist that these are the characters theyre supposed to care about you know what they do they go no im not watching this go yourselves and they decided to try to explain things that never needed explaining i wanted to pay tribute to all of the iconic either items or sayings you know i wanted to i wanted it to mean something when thelma said jinkies for the first time you know you where does it come from you know sort of why is her vision so bad you know just those things that you know about velmas like okay well lets put story weight behind this but most of these things didnt need a justification maybe she was just born with bad eyesight maybe she says jinkies because she doesnt want to say holy hairy stained ball sacks it really aint that deep bro and the way they explain these things is so stupid so i put on my moms glasses and vowed i wouldnt open her gift until i found her so you just messed up your eyesight because youre an idiot well done my glasses i hope this doesnt keep happening her iconic catchphrase jinkies is written on a note left by her missing mum which gives her a clue but its so forced jinkies jinkies why are you saying jinkies is this like when you tried to make keep it frosty a thing cheekies okay now youre totally trying to make it a thing and why do we need to know how she got her red shoes theyre not important at all why waste any time on this who gives a im definitely searching for her lost parents because she wants to know why she as an asian girl has naturally red hair and this is the answer say yes and well tell you why you have orange hair oh my god yes during pregnancy like a lot like i should be dead oh this is so flippant and anticlimactic why should i take the show seriously when this is how seriously it takes itself music its worse than pointless or frivolous though its outright disrespectful despite claims to love the franchise velma repeatedly insults it youre saying my mom was taken by the ghost of your mom really i thought only idiots in blist actresses believed in ghosts it turns out that fred is the one who painted the flowers on the future mystery machine but since the joke is that they look terrible because hes incompetent this is directly dunking on the original design because nothings trashier or more petal tinged than teens in an old van on that note the mystery machine now does look like a free candy pedo van which aptly sums up how velma treats its ip in general you know what is right um yeah its code for adults who still watch cartoons yeah insult your own audience see how that works out for you at one point they emulate a chase sequence from the original show complete with music and sound effects problem is its not a new recording it sounds like its from the s and is therefore very jarring out of place with the rest of the show would it have been too much to just record a new version stop going through doors like this isnt physical oh this isnt possible thats the joke an old tiny photo booth we can disguise ourselves daddy looks stupid it will take at least five minutes to change who would ever stop to put on a costume in the middle of a chase my doctor has advised that i watch my blood pressure so why dont you just go away you nincompoopy person i think charlie did such a brilliant thing with the the writing staff of taking all these things and providing easter eggs so that real fans of the show know that we like know the series inside and out easter eggs might make a good show more interesting for fans but they dont do anything to redeem a badge show or convince fans that know this is good actually so throwing in easter eggs and references in a pathetic attempt to make the fan base squealing glee does nothing to compensate for any of this and actually adds more insult to injury by reminding them that better versions of this exist it also makes it worse because it proves that the creators werent ignorant about the ip they just didnt care well it appears ive gotten away with it you meddling tinfoil hat on her but you can almost feel that they secretly resented having to tie their own ideas into an existing property and took out that resentment by ruining it out of spite velma is the worst thing to happen to the scoobydoo franchise since scrappydoo so much so that it doesnt even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it and may god have mercy on your soul well get to the comedy in a bit but the other aspects of the writing are also less than subpar real surprising i know the story is that velma is investigating a serial killer thats preying on hot girls in her hometown of crystal cove while also trying to find out what happened to her mum who went missing two years beforehand recruiting the other members of the gang along the way aside from any other issues the story itself is poorly written and the narrative is riddled with numerous examples of stupidity the crystal mines of course that would explain how the serial killer moves around unseen theres a sewer system under the entire city and you already knew about this you smooth brained bint it made me think that the writing teams favorite food was wood glue theres so many of these that i cant possibly go through every one so heres some of the more egregious like for example the first two dead girls are discovered in velmas locker and garbage bin so shes treated as a suspect but fred gets convicted based on the flimsiest reasoning and then exonerated but never does the suspicion pass back to velma like youd think it would she basically gets her free pass its never shown how velma obtains daphnes journal i mentioned earlier leading to a not insignificant plot hole when shes dressed as a man she gets up on stage to convince everyone that the killer is real and not just a ghost and everyone believes her because of the male privilege she apparently now has i have something to say and as a man speaking authoritatively you are going to listen to me and you are going to believe me the insultingly named scooby turns out to be a plan to swap the brains of soldiers with those of hippies back in the s because this general really hated those meddling kids norvilles grandma was the scientist in charge of this program but she went insane and hid her journal so no one could recreate her work eventually its revealed that she wasnt insane but she did hide the journals in order to foil the scheme but why not just destroy the journals completely if thats what she wanted theyre made of paper this doesnt make any sense its such a massive contrivance oh and they established that snapping your fingers breaks someone out of hypnosis but its never brought up again even when multiple characters turn out to have been hypnotized and it would have been useful too much of the time vilma figures something out due to chance or pure rather than her own intelligence which cheapens the mystery velma finds a clue by reading one of her mums smutty stories which features invisible ink she then holds up the jinkys note she found which was written by her mum revealing what turns out to be the serial killers phone number its never explained how her mum who was kidnapped and hypnotized discovered this number or obtained invisible ink or how she even escaped from wherever she was being confined in the last episode velma gets a clue because her glasses were made by freds parents company as was the killers pocket watch that she found and the general used this type of watch to hypnotize people therefore freds mum must be the killer thats so flimsy that could all be a complete coincidence and i dont care if the franchise ever did stuff like this before its still dumb as hell but the best part you want to know the best part freds mom wants to plant another brain inside fred because hes too much of a dumbass to entrust the company to and she wants the brain of a woman who would appreciate the advantages that being a rich white man would bring her and she suddenly decides that that is velma yes this is why theyve had her make so many snarky comments about men and white people throughout the show just so they could set up this moment my brain just about dribbled out of my nose at this point and like i said this is just some of the issues with the plot there are also many examples where proper care and attention to detail was lacking some of these are minor things that you wouldnt notice unless you were paying attention but theres enough of them that it makes the presentation really sloppy and some of them lead to story errors like how they figure out the password to the killers phone because only those numbers have fingerprints on them have these people ever seen or used smartphone screen and like how velma no clips through a wall at one point to get past the killer and how could they up the quadratic formula all they had to do was copy paste it even peppa pig got that right because of their lame attempts to mix serious murder mystery with teen drama with adult comedy the tone is all over the place rapidly shifting within the same scene or between scenes its so jarring and whenever the show isnt irritating you or pissing you off it is so boring how they expected anyone to sit through this without a shock collar is anyones guess but you could probably upload this to pornhub under the ball busting category and it wouldnt be out of place right off the bat the characters are so awful that i just dont care about any of their goals why would i want velma to find out what happens to her mum when id rather watch her get fed into a wood chipper the emotional buyin is just not there but its also partly because the show is incredibly predictable i watched this with a group and we had some bingo cards with a list of our expectations on them and within one minute of run time someone had a bingo it relies on a lot of the same tropes and stereotypes that youve seen for decades without doing anything new or interesting with them this is the first chance ive had to focus thank god hot girls would rather be murdered than enter the band room its also due to the absolutely horrendous pacing velma suffers from it feels like very little of any substance happens for very long stretches of the run time and theres so much padding repetition and redundancy like they have fred escape from prison but then at the end of the episode he gets thrown back into prison just to have him leave again in the next episode its also pointless and its mostly because the actual mystery of the series only takes up if were being generous about half the run time the rest is spent on a bunch of subplots that either dont go anywhere contribute nothing to the main story or intended for character development but only make us hate the characters more and the episodes move between subplots so rapidly that its disorienting structurally its a mess the most egregious of these subplots although it is related to the main plot is velmas panic attacks whenever she tries to solve a mystery she has violent hallucinations that can even give her a heart attack the way that she is snapped out of these is either by someone making her laugh or daphne kissing her it comes across as a contrived and unnecessary obstacle to make solving mysteries more difficult for her and she overcomes it very quickly when she discovers the root of her anxiety oh wait oh no i hallucinate because i have daddy issues gross many people who deal with anxiety attacks were quick to denounce this inaccurate and kind of offensive portrayal and to compare it to the way theyre dealt with in puss in boots which came out around the same time id also make a comparison with hollyhocks panic attacking bojack horseman which again is a far superior depiction and to top it all off its eventually revealed that her hallucinations were not actually due to anxiety but because she was hypnotized by the killer to keep her from investigating her moms disappearance but the serial killer could have just killed her right there and then theres literally no reason why she should still be alive and they spend so much time on stupid teen drama thats neither original interesting or particularly captivating the usual high school nonsense and love quadrangles that to make me want to snort antifreeze and remember when they said in additionally we wanted to you know we loved the original it really is a love letter to the original we wanted to sort of say okay well scoobydoo made me laugh and also really scared me when i was a child how can i adapt that to an adult audience and try to give them the same level of humor and horror that they experienced as a kid with this new version well nothing in this show is scary or thrilling at all none of it the space cook law from the original show is scarier than anything in velma even as an adult its kind of freaky no but lets talk about the adult part now we briefly touched on this earlier but yes velma is an adult show for adults who do adulty things like pay taxes and read newspapers and cheat on their wives but it doesnt mean that the show explores any adult themes in a way thats intelligent and also funny no no no instead lets just have all the characters be stupid or both out of a misguided attempt to make them more interesting for adults because you cant have an adult show without everyone being a stupid right and of course this means that crystal cove has to be a and the show has to include violence gore and lots of sexy sexy sex things which theres nothing wrong with in themselves but its a mistake to think that the inclusion of these makes your work more mature as opposed to just not being suitable for kids having cockroaches within the first proper scene of your show doesnt make you look adult it makes you look like youre trying too hard and mindy kaling seems to really like writing teenagers having sexy times despite also claiming to not understand them does it let you understand gen z better do you understand the younglings i dont i dont understand them any better and i so between that show and i have another show called the sex lives of college girls and i just im like what am i doing like why am i writing these sexy shows about teens are you making up for a lost time by giving these racy experiences to younger people i think yes it should also be noted at this point that none of the characters sound or act like teenagers so no thats not an excuse for them being awful anyway while there isnt any fullon sex barely two minutes in and were seeing naked girls wrestling in the school showers just admit we are all velma is openly quite horny damn dilf city i mean sure if someone was like want to see a naked picture of fred id be like but i do womens comedy stuff you know talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guys and then say yeah we even get to witness her pole dancing which makes me want to give myself the oedipus treatment where were going we wont need eyes to say again we wanted to be respectful to the ip we didnt want to say ah look what we can do with these people and you know kind of put them in in what might be a little uncomfortable where youre going to be like i dont i dont know if i want to see velma or or normal or you know fred doing that um well what the is this then the big problem with all this that the writers either didnt notice or worse care about is that velma is years old at least according to this promotional poster and you cant tell me her younger self two years prior is any older than and while the other ages are never specified its pretty heavily implied that the other kids are around the same age they act like these characters are over age when theyre not which means that when velmas dad takes her to a strip club it isnt just inappropriate its something else entirely it means that all the sexual discussions about fred and the mocking of his penis take on a whole nother level of bad and all of the instances where the hot girls are sexualized are put in a whole new context shes underage and shes underage and she thinks that he is over age this is all kinds of up but and this is crucial none of this is portrayed as if its up this becomes less surprising when you learn that kaling has previously been criticized over her handling of sex and consent in her previous works i guess they can use the big mouth excuse of well theyre only cartoons so its okay but but really want to best strategy in this situation bit of a fail moment there to be honest and this extends to the exploration of velmas sexual identity so yeah lets do this ive avoided it long enough with weights and nods lets finally talk about the only thing youve ever really wanted to know about me is velma dinklies snap out of it its been a longrunning subject of speculation that velma is in fact a lesbian and if she had been all along i dont think it would have been particularly surprising to anyone in fact she was confirmed to be gay by the producer of mystery incorporated and was portrayed as such in s trickortreat scoobydoo so once again this angle isnt exactly original or necessary but in velma they really go for it her kind of discovering herself and her identity in its her friendships her relationships her romantic relationships was really what was really fun about the show coming from my other shows never have i ever in the sex lives of college girls that charlie worked on like we really think that stuff is juicy and it felt like yet another reason why it was great that this was a modern show they spend so much time on this will they wont they relationship between velma and daphne because of course its daphne daphne and me kiss what her hands on my hips what i think hes passing between us what this is despite them having no chemistry and being so diametrically opposed as people that theres really no reason they should get together daphne is dating fred who velma also likes and fred likes them both and because theyre all such idiots we have to suffer through an unbearable love hate triangle with norville simping off to the side and youll never convince me that this wasnt some kind of wish fulfillment on kalings part wait fred thats huge though not you might be gave you okay stop in this day and age you cant speculate about someones sexuality unless theyre famous or peppermint patty oh yeah the meta commentary how has it taken me so long to mention this but if the kids in every teen show ever can get through a brush with a deranged serial killer so can i both in terms of its quality and quantity the metacometry in this show alone had me nearly lying down in front of a truck normally origin stories are about tall handsome guys struggling with the burden of being handed even more power the entire opening scene is one long meta commentary on opening scenes because thats clever right have you ever noticed how pilot episodes of tv shows always have more gratuitous sex annuity than the rest of the series spec sells and in todays overcrowded market you need a hook um the only hook a good show ever needs is good storytelling which is hilarious because this show has neither the first few episodes in particular lay this on thicker than your mother according to tv its morally okay to deal drugs if your life is just kinda crappy those are all white people daphne minorities on tv can only deal drugs to escape poverty you possibly being gay is a huge deal for one it reduces me to cliched straight best friend its like it was written by people who are only familiar with similar shows and they were trying to demonstrate that knowledge as much as possible then why was your favorite part of the riverdale pilot when betty and veronica kiss but because i was instantly called i was tired in the scene i thought lesbians were good at solving crimes its like the one positive stereotype perpetuated by cop shows sorry im not a drunk on the verge of losing custody like every other woman solving murders these days oh my god we get it you know the genre that youre part of now shot the up it is so transparently an attempt to be clever and also coverup for their creative bankruptcy but just pointing out your knowledge of the genre youre operating in which most people watching this would already know doesnt make you look smart it makes you look like a tryhard wait in teen movies whenever a girl needs money a guy sells something and then blackmails the girl in the dating him for it problematic but effective and pointing out the tropes and plot points that youre copying from other examples in your genre doesnt give you a get out of jail free card for copying them hey guys if this were a youtube video thered be an ad right about now you uh you adblock users wont be able to appreciate that joke i see you most of the time they dont even say anything about the tropes they highlight they dont offer any kind of intelligent commentary or post modern subversion they just say hey everybody look at this thing were doing and then they and then they do it over characters making dramatic entrances on tv shows i actually love dramatic entrances its just incredibly lazy writing the point is i dont know but im sure ill figure it out it would be pretty lazy not to and you know what else it is its pretentious they structure one episode in a nonlinear way with multiple flashbacks and flash forwards this can work in certain things depending on how its handled but in the wrong hands its clunky and well pretentious they only do this for one episode and it doesnt add anything at all that a linear structure wouldnt its unnecessary but they try to excuse it with meta commentary i like you when they use a title card with the characters name when they cut to a different flashback now that feels lazy its stylized its tarantino what is the incident some of this metacometry was intended to address criticism that they knew theyd receive which ghostbusters and more recently shehulk also attempted and how do you feel about race point casting daphne well as an asian woman i um think its cool i mean not to oversimplify authority issue but everyone loves it when white people play jesus or a professional boxer why cant it ever go the other way right i hope this doesnt become a regular trend because it isnt the win that they think it is you know how he beat the trolls you make something good but i guess that was too hard i still say its more seamless without the title card and i still say my old job is a television executive makes me worry audiences wont be able to follow it sitting through all this dribble is like being naught alive by rats what else what else about the writing oh the dialogue the dialogue is ass because most of it is either poorly written characterization poorly written insults poorly written metachometry or poorly written social commentary i punch you of men didnt sexualize a women fighting and the rest is utterly forgettable oh and they make use of intercredits scenes which are completely pointless and could have just been tagged on to the end of the episode because into credit scenes are all the rage now so they have to do them i i swear they did this just to with us just say who the serial killer is of course its its me oh you see guys you see they pulled a fast one on us they did a sneaky one even though this doesnt make any sense because this episode aired back to back with the next one so its not much of a cliffhanger is it you know what though all of this could have been forgiven if the show were at least funny but velmas about as amusing as gonorrhea did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up thats the joke ive said this in previous videos but a failure in any other category of media could still be enjoyable because of how bad it is i did not hit her its not true its i did not hit her i did not oh hi mark but a bad comedy offers nothing to go on and its actually impressive how much velma fails at comedy they should be taught in schools not only is velma far less funny than other iterations of scoobydoo but ive met bricks that have a better grasp of humor than this shows writers did i have to be wait you said fog king not the jokes are painfully eye rollingly unfunny and lets count the ways how whenever were talking about comedy theres always going to be an element that is unavoidably subjective and that is audience buyin the extent to which the audience is on board with the comedy and willing to laugh at the jokes the charisma of the person telling the joke can go a long way to ensuring this buyin if you hate someone youre not gonna laugh at their jokes and because velma is so contemptible and inspires nothing but negativity from its audience that initial buyin either wears off very quickly or it never gets achieved in the first place many watchers quickly came to hate the show what it was trying to achieve and what it did to its franchise and so the phrase tough crowd doesnt really do the situation justice and i think that for many people myself included this is one of the main reasons why they refuse to participate in the comedy and find it funny while most of velmas jokes are dog we dont even want to laugh at the ones that arent dog because we resent this end of price so much but dont get me wrong the jokes here are dog and im about to perform the audiobook voices isnt it well you too you some of the jokes are just straight up not funny there are jokes that are so poorly written that even though you know theyre meant to be a joke theyre indistinguishable from any other line of dialogue our sexy dancing is for ourselves and wants to raise money for a dog that needed hip surgery this is set up like a joke but theres no punchline it isnt funny and its redundant who cares about this information if the audience has to repeatedly ask what the joke is maybe reconsider your role as a comedy writer people only wear fleece when theyre looking for startup money or oh no going hiking there are jokes that i could swear ive witnessed before in other media which means they dont feel fresh laughs well well and in at least one case theres a joke ripped almost entirely from something else although i dont know if this was intentional so we have one day to unlearn a lifetime of internalized misogyny im getting waxed at four then we have until four i dont care how long it takes i will keep you here all night we cant keep them past four i will keep you here until four and then there are the jokes that i swear were only written because they felt they had to be constantly making jokes regardless of how good those jokes are or what implications they create for the characters themselves well then call me a medieval minstrel cause im about to loot that joke was more forced in than this ad again if youre using youtube premium or adblock or youre watching on patreon this is probably kind of awkward right now so were just were just gonna sit in silence for a minute i am now dissing her she has no brain well now you just look like a sociopath theres also too much of what you might call joss whedon humor or marvel humor which has become unfortunately commonplace over the last years happy come on its time to go look for the serial killer in the woods and yes saying that out loud for the first time it sounds like a terrible idea but all i can really do in response to these is let out an exasperated sigh they dont warrant any further comment theyre just tiresome the show frequently demonstrates a poor sense of comic timing jokes either go on too long or cut off too quickly before they can sink in thus ruining what might otherwise have been okay jokes hey i dont want to ruin the moment but the brains are starting to smell and repetition by itself is so funny you guys you didnt answer my vms voicemails vms voicemails vms voice i know what vms are get to the point i already did in my vms i left you six more vms its sad when the background pawns are funnier than the actual jokes youre meant to be focusing on although thats not saying a lot can you teach me how to unhinge my jaw like that i want to join a sorority velma falls into that trap that many other adult comedies do of thinking that being funny for adults just means being inappropriate for kids to their credit unlike say santa incor hoops they didnt employ copious amounts of swearing or even swear much at all even when a curse word might have been funnier than the written punchline now even just being myself will work rom comes and kiss my ass but they did make sure to serve up a big helping of sex jokes gross out humor and meaningless violence i cannot believe i wore edible underwear for this again maybe chill out with this why is it funny for some random guy to get his leg cut off and then the next episode he gets it cut off again despite doing nothing to deserve it except looking like a reddit mode be in itself and does nothing to justify its inclusion unlike similar examples you could find and bear in mind that the gross stuff is happening to and around previously beloved characters and none of its funny even in context its just its just crass i shut everyone out i still havent seen my dentist nor do i intend to this is who were supposed to be rooting for do you get it because its like like the root of your teeth you got it these are all such transparent attempts to shock you into laughing out of shearing credulity which can work in certain situations and theyre clearly trying to emulate successful examples of comedies that achieve this like south park but the jokes dont make sense or are poorly executed when they do and you can feel their desperation to get a reaction from you wait no keep them on the only time i laughed at one of these jokes is when she got hit by a car and thats only because i wanted to see her suffer because shes a terrible person which they thought was funny and thats another major reason why all the characters are because comedy centered around a group of eccentric idiots who were also bad people such as its always sunny in philadelphia can be absolutely hilarious depending on the context and execution velmas writers thought this meant being an equals funny which is why the characters insult each other so much and are just generally despicable cindy i am sad my husband died anything crucial difference is that you cant base a comedy around the escapades of awful people if those characters are insufferable to watch and its also lacking in any charisma and wit that it just comes across as meanspirited instead of amusing you know what is right um yeah its code for adults who still watch cartoons the reason im using this clip again is because it could have come across as playful banter with their target audience had it not been delivered with so much sincere vitriol and condescension hey you yeah you you watching this video right now your mothers a fat please laugh much of the metacometry we discussed earlier is used for comedic purposes yeah well theres no world where im ever solving a mystery in an abandoned amusement parks aha good one guys you had the whole hosting and pissing and crying its actually ridiculous how many of these jokes there are ive never seen anything try this hard to do meta humor see now if this was a shell itd be super hard if you two kissed krista if this is a show youd be killed after being horny weve already talked about their attempts to be meta but ill just reiterate that acknowledging the tropes in your genre and saying that youre using them is not funny in and of itself and its not a substitute for writing actual jokes yeah normally in pop culture when a girl is murdered were all a little like well maybe she deserved it she was the rare that did not deserve to be murdered well as opposed to all the other slots that had it coming what what the metahumor like this has been done to death by this point and none of it is insightful or funny all of it needed to go in the bin and the bin needed to be set on fire we wouldnt be stuck here like a hours reboot with a bigger more diverse cast that all people will gripe about you want to know how to do good meta humor like this the token black guy and not another teen movie which pokes fun at the trope that was common in related media at the time and points out how absurd and kind of racist it is you know youre an intelligent insightful human being who doesnt get the respect and attention that he deserves you really mean that jake great man because ive always wanted to discuss with you the repercussions of the ramification but the writers of velma werent actually interested in saying anything of worth and substance they just wanted to prove how smart they are i dont know how much longer i can take being unpopular how to network sitcoms handle it which also explains the use of reference humor of mandos i know you ate why doesnt she like talking is it is it because hes white again making a reference by itself isnt a joke especially when its to a dated meme or has been celebrity id be an idiot not to at least try and go for it and is this really the best joke they could think of oh so youre gonna work are you well then call me ernest shackleton because im headed to a poll referencing th century explorers and existentialist philosophers doesnt impress me if the joke itself isnt funny oh god theres no exit anywhere oh my jeanpaul sartre did you get that mom no exit like star trek seminal play about hell i do hell truly is other people and naturally theres failed attempts to provide humorous social commentary places like this help skip gates learn which white actors are descended from slave owners im named after theodore roosevelt a wealthy demagogue who massacred indigenous people in the name of imperialism well i tried but only got halfway there thats just me living up to my label as a male feminist socially or politically charged jokes can be hilarious just look at the boondocks or even scoobydoo itself has done this but youve got a job as a teacher why do you need more money music but then theres stuff like this is it up we just learned someone somewhere as being intolerant applause again its clear that theyre trying to copy south park where this thing works because the whole show is so absurd and deliberately over the top and because the jokes are still woven into the narrative and makes sense in the context of the episode but here theres none of that its just thrown in and doesnt match the general tone of the show and it again shows that they refuse to take anything seriously while also demanding that we take them seriously is that a joke fred or are you being serious or is it that cable comedy thing where its both i think smiling friends got this right applause great job everyone within their reuters room they all thought this was some of the funniest theyd ever seen on pickle rick i think the worst part though is that there are occasional glimpses of comedic ability that are never fully allowed to shine through okay so dont search for daddy issues and teenage girls and bookmarks they do have the makings of some okay jokes but they never fully realized because they sabotage themselves at every turn like in one episode velma and norvilles girlfriend gigi have a flute off the joke is that theyre both bad at it and in a different context it might have been funny one kid removes his hearing aid which could be funny if you just left it at the visual but they framed it so poorly that they had to have a character literally explain what the joke is i think devin just unplugged his cochlear implants i could try to fix more examples of failed jokes but whats the point this thing is beyond saving and okay jokes just arent good enough what results is a stillbirth of a comedy so utterly devoid of effective humor that its genuinely baffling that this was the product of real human beings and not aliens struggling to understand humanity so they can distract us while they turn the frogs gay why didnt the hallucination start until then as a man analyzing a woman can we assume menzies where do you say toby the truth looks like thats why i love children no girl it does look like theres nothing redeeming about velmas production values either on the surface it isnt the worst looking animation ive ever seen at least it doesnt look like another generic family guy clone or even be called scoobydoo seriously what is this i vomit but the more you evaluate velmas visuals the worse they get early concept art showed off character designs that were at least somewhat interesting although they made fred a shortcake for some reason but the designs we got are honestly pretty boring and in some cases dont look anything like their original characters like norville for example an artist created a version that was much more heavily inspired by shaggys older designs and looks much better to boot these character designs feel very uninspired in comparison visually the show is just very dull to look at there are some exceptions to this like for example the hallucination scenes dont actually look half bad and at one point they show flashbacks to eras like the s and s and replicate the visual styles of animation from those decades which offer brief glimpses of something as critically interesting but it makes the rest of the show look even more bland in comparison its clear that hbo didnt dig deep into their pockets for this one or if they did it was to make the tax writeoff more worthwhile because the standards of animation in velma are unworthy of the genre frankly and im not blaming the overworked and underpaid artist that im sure was suffering under the cracking whip we all have to pay bills after all this is a failure at higher levels but the amount of inconsistencies errors and sloppy work is inexcusable of course cartoons dont have to be realistic but there are still some basic standards velma failed to adhere to character designs can change between consecutive scenes or even between consecutive shots in the same scene its like they were drawn by completely different people which of course is how animation teams often work but they shouldnt be this inconsistent and this happens numerous times velma is so squashed sometimes she ends up looking like an oompa loompa or et and i love the animation its so beautiful in the show say what you want about family guy clones but at least they are more consistent in how bland they look sometimes the animation is just bad one of the biggest reasons why is that the character movements arent smooth which makes for cheaper animation but it looks weird and artificial compared with other animations that ive seen mouth movements in particular can look quite ugly another big reason is that the characters stand out from the backgrounds but not in a way that feels either natural or visually appealing in general the backgrounds are rendered with more detail and have gradients to their colors and shading whereas the characters all have flat colors and little to no shading this combined with differences in perspectives angles and lighting between the characters and the backgrounds results in the former looking artificial and superimposed which of course they are but again they shouldnt look like it again as boring as family guy clones look at least their characters look like they belong in their environments they also kept trying to blur distant objects as a way to artificially establish depth of field but not only were they horrifically inconsistent at applying it at all they were really incompetent when they did take this shot for example the signs the bin and the nerd are all the same distance away from the camera but you wouldnt know that none of these objects should be this blurry when theyre this close and this house in the background isnt even blurred at all which doesnt make any sense based on the effect they were trying to achieve im guessing this was because they couldnt apply a blur to the background without blurring the entire background which im sure they could have found a fix for and if they couldnt why even bother with any of it at all and there are so many examples of cheaply done and cheap looking effects whether its eyebrows being on top of hair because thats easier to animate or its wet hair being shown just by putting blue patches on it or having a falling animation thats just a static pose of the characters getting smaller it doesnt get any lazier than that and as with the writing theres a lack of proper attention to visual details whether its background objects looking different in different shots characters getting soaking wet and then looking completely dry seconds later a whiskey bottle being dropped on the back of a laptop and then the screen itself showing a point of impact or numerous other examples and while i can understand using the same assets repeatedly to save on costs when you start copy pasting them into the same scene it not only looks very obvious and lazy but creates blatant inconsistencies lets analyze one scene in particular to demonstrate just how poorly this show is put together from this wide shot of the courthouse with a small crowd on either side of the stairs it cuts to a female reporter who is not previously visible and the now larger crowd is directly behind her the crowd is very obviously on a one second loop they havent even tried to hide how little work they put in here then in the next shot the crowd is blurred when they really shouldnt be not only are the exact same signs repeated several times but the guy in the white shirt and the guy in the suit are shown twice in the same camera pan and multiple characters teleport around the scene also note the use of depth of field here the crowd is blurred but the interior of the limo isnt this approaches food fight levels of laziness sheepness and inconsistency and i wouldnt be surprised if velmas animators refused to list this on their resume as for the performances ive shown enough clips that you should have an idea by now but the most i can say about them is that theyre adequate at best but they dont elevate the material out of its place in the trash tier nor are they going to win any awards for it i mean what they supposed to do when the material is this crap there was no chance they were going to get a voice cast that was either the most appropriate for the characters or the most talented at voice acting this is a vanity project that came about due to industry connections and it was inevitable that they would just hire a bunch of their mates in the industry but even so velma does feel like a waste of the cast talent like jane lynch is great but in this shes mired in how bad the material is god where is that candyman i mean candy it could be anybody even though we both definitely know its a man and they got weird al yankovic to do a cameo but its so lame and you wouldnt even know it was him and i do think that mindy kalings voice is a bit annoying to listen to at least it isnt sarah silvermans in santa inc that woman should never be allowed to voice act again im sorry i need to scream more applause haha but kailyns voice is like the cherry on top of an already ingratiating character how dare you call any woman a monster you monster im dressed like this to show support for all the beautiful ways women express themselves even the ones i think are stupid and there are many many issues with the lip syncing but i have a clue about my mom and i cant research it without you im assuming the animation softwares algorithm soiled itself but there are many occasions where the mouth movements barely match the dialogue no but i have found a way to make you like me we do make a good team dont we every little kid knows how to draw a penis but make a little kid draw a vagina and what happens and so theres really nothing for aficionados of animation to enjoy here nothing that makes it stand out from the rest of its genre and despite its initial appeal it actively comes out worse compared to many other adult animations in virtue of its poor quality cheap and inconsistent presentation looking good and having good production values would not have made up for velmas other terrible qualities but me they havent exactly help themselves have they oh so forming an angry mommy who are we going after thats all i have to say about the show itself for now but velma wouldnt be the perfect subject for a video like this without an unhealthy amount of spice and you know me i do i do love me some good controversy so pour yourself a nice glass of milk and get ready to be called a racist its unfortunate that in a video about a terrible comedy we have to talk about race but velma put its foot into that frying pan long ago and then it was announced about a month ago that the development character would be reimagined as south asian and people were not happy they werent happy with the change they were not happy there was a lot of like show not velma it was decided that velma who was previously white would have her ethnicity change to indian to match that of kalings and the essence of velma is not you know its not necessarily tied to her whiteness you know like and i identify so much as her character and i think so many people do so we just had like yeah lets make her indian in this series yeah perhaps off the back of this the other characters were also change to match their voice actors now some people will complain about this just on principle they resent any attempt to introduce diversity into media denouncing it as woke trash regardless of the logic behind it with velma though theres a little bit more going on they chose to misrepresent the reasons why people took umbrage with this decision well its like shes such a great character shes so smart and i just couldnt understand how people couldnt imagine a really smart nerdy girl with terrible eyesight and loved to solve mysteries could not be indie right like there are indian nerds they think that it shouldnt be a surprise to people the point isnt that they couldnt imagine a character like this being indian the point is why change an existing character in the first place the purpose of course was to achieve more representation the creators were open about wanting to achieve more representation for ethnic minorities in animation and about how important representation was to them personally its a weird thing to grow up and to love a genre and a fantasy of things and to know that it doesnt love you back because it doesnt show anybody that looks like you ever in it its cool to be part of this movie because you think that you know the eightyearold version of of mindy kaling the the chubby friendly indian girl with big glasses because shed be like oh like it we are being represented kaling repeatedly said that she was inspired by into the spiderverse when making velma i think we were really inspired by you know into the spiderverse and these ideas that theres so many iterations of the characters in its animation we can do anything the difference of course is that mars morales was an original character who was always black whereas velma had to be race swapped and the essence of velma is not you know its not necessarily tied to her whiteness you know but you havent even preserved the same essence of velma this is some abomination do you really think indian girls are going to be happy about seeing themselves represented like this by the way im not saying that representative characters have to be perfect in fact if they are thats a little bit condescending but like theres a middle ground here guys velma is the worst thing to happen to indians since the british and i can say that because i am british kaling has previously attracted controversy over issues of representation in her work which i wont get into here except to say that her efforts in this regard have inspired mixed feelings to say the least and with velma kaling has been accused of perpetuating the same harmful stereotypes about indian girls that she has in her previous work but ill let other people address that topic personally i think race swapping is the least of this shows problems and i couldnt care less if they wanted to add more diversity while also recognizing that representation is something ive never really had to worry about myself but simply race swapping existing characters is the laziest way to achieve this creating original works and filling them with diversity is a far more organic and valuable use of a creators time rather than changing something that already exists the characters are not defined by their whiteness um and so we thought theres it felt like there is time in an inclination from in an appetite for people to see them reimagined im sorry but not a single person on this planet whose opinion is worth taking seriously looked at scoobydoo and went oh gee howdy i do love this show i just wish these three specific characters werent white growing up i just was one of the only people around the animated character could really identify with you know shes obviously not indian but shes i felt like she was like you know like really pretty but an untraditional way like super smart and unafraid of being smart um big big thick glasses which like obviously i can identify with so you admit that you could identify with a character even though they dont look like you if the characters arent defined by their race then why even change them at all because you can already identify with them it makes the whole enterprise pointless especially when that race swapping is of no other consequence kaling was very happy about velma being indian and i take all this to be more evidence of kaling inserting herself into the show and imposing her identity on an existing character but when she was asked how her indian identity would affect her as a character she couldnt give an answer so a lot of your work whether you start on it or not um youll always bring a little south asian culture to it you know just beyond the characters physical appearance so i was wondering how do you hope to bring that as well well she has an indian family um and i dont know like i love this opportunity i have now to be able to have representation of indian americans like modern indian american teams and ive done in a couple other shows and charlie obviously has written with me before and we just thought it was such a great opportunity and at the beginning i identify so much with the velma character and i think shes a character were like i dont know her ethnicity and the original yeah im willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that she was tired after doing a lot of interviews but this question never comes up in any other interview that i saw so as far as im concerned its unanswered and aside from a couple of jokes her ethnicity and cultural background has no effect on her characterization whatsoever when you see your pops next tell him thanks from me homie changed my life fred ive told you my dad isnt the bhagwan shri rajnish so this change feels meaningless all but it was so important to keep fred white so they could constantly make white man bad jokes and whats it like being been able to reimagine vilmas identity and finally creating a story with classic characters for people who want to see someone like them well honestly we wouldnt be doing this if in the s s s s and early s there was more cartoons that really represented us we wouldnt feel the need i mean granted the franchise did have its questionable moments as did many kids cartoons if you go back far enough and i can sympathize to some extent with the desire for more and better representation for ones demographic and media which has definitely been an issue in the past this is the strongest argument they had for making these changes and it isnt completely without merit but existing characters and franchises arent your play things to achieve your personal visions and imposing your viewpoint on characters with a long history and large fan base is at best of questionable taste and at worst arrogant and obnoxious but partly this also reads like virtue signaling on the part of the creators particularly kaling herself just watch this clip where shes talking about being in the monsters inc spinoff series theres no female characters in the first one wait no thats not true thats not thats a lie that i just opened with a lie i instantly thought of two characters i was about to make this big political point about how exciting it was and i can name three characters that are female you already got up to three you said zero and then you said two and now youre after three so um i guess its not that exciting that im in the show why would a person come on a show with a fact thats not correct did you know what i was i wanted to come in and make a statement yeah i wanted to be like im breaking barriers with this show i was like i am the first woman of color thats ever been in an animated movie or tv show and its a lie its a lie is she taking the piss is it is this a piss take is she is she trolling us why would she say any of this it seems clear to me that in addition to wanting to feel like they were doing something necessary and important they were also trying to market the show as such although genuinely important to some representation has become another buzzword that media companies like to use to appeal to certain markets as well as the stifle criticism and unfortunately there are gullible audience members that will line up to swallow this nonsense gravy and to denounce anyone who took issue with velmas approach to representation as racist is absolutely ridiculous and weve already talked about the irritating political commentary and snarky quips and they really are overbearing using existing and beloved characters as a mouthpiece for politically charged opinions whether they your own or not is best avoided and honestly pretty disrespectful in many cases it doesnt feel like any of the scripts were like didactic or trying to like force anything down anybodys throats its actually just how the world looks today well that was a lie velmas interesting in that its managed to unite both sides of the political spectrum left right woke antiwoke whatever terms you want to use it became the latest target in the ever exhausting culture war except that instead of conflicting sides fighting over it everyone hates it rightwing people hate it because its not only bad but woke and based basically a wet dream for them in terms of confirming their opinions about progressive media conversely leftwing people hate it because its so poorly written and insufferable that it makes their side look bad in fact many didnt buy that it was progressive at all which is certainly debatable and its even been accused of being what rightwingers think of woke show is leading to accusations that its a rightwing psyop intended to paint progressive people in a bad light much like for example the trailer for netflixs q force was indistinguishable from a homophobic parody i dont believe this theory myself and the evidence for it is pretty flimsy mindy kaling liking a tweet from jk rowling saying some of the jokes in the office would upset people nowadays and the shows occasional jabs at young peoples sensitivity simply arent good enough proof in addition if they were trying to parody awoke show they could have gone much harder with it something can be progressive and cringy without being a double bluff psyop oh i would rather watch an rrated animated christmas comedy with a touch of a feminist agenda an equally rightwing media can also be pretty bad velma isnt bad because its outwardly progressive its bad because its obnoxious and misguided about it and parody can sometimes be indistinguishable from reality because sometimes reality really is that stupid despite all this i dont think the creators of velma were actually trying to push a specific political agenda with this show i think they genuinely thought this was funny or at least would piss people off you can tell that they were desperately trying to be equal opportunity offenders like say south park but without the balls to commit to actually being offensive and without the talent and moral center to pull it off these people dont actually believe in anything which is why theyre so inconsistent maybe vilmas creators really were just that incompetent and selfabsorbed but while they do say that you should never attribute to malice what you can attribute to stupidity there was certainly at least some malice involved oh that wasnt a bit nice you have made me very angry very angry indeed velma is a deliberate exercise in rage bait and while it may not have been the whole reason behind its creation its undeniable that at least part of their strategy involved pissing off a great swath of people in order to farm outrage views and im not talking about making something bad so that people who ironically enjoy bad media will watch it out of amusement and curiosity im talking about actively pissing people off theres too much evidence for this to attribute it all to stupidity alone the teaser trailer was very obviously bait it was making fun of trolls who had criticized the shows race swapping if there is one thing the internet agrees on its that you should never change anything ever i hope you die sincerely velma well at least judys still white ah and why slap an insulting remark about your audience and franchise onto the end of your release trailer if you werent trying to provoke a negative reaction adults who still watch cartoons and its not a coincidence that the first two episodes were filled with some of the most egregious and provocative statements in imagery why would you deride your franchise and solely its legacy so thoroughly and so openly if you werent trying to piss off its fan base into watching out of outrage to see how much damage youve done to their beloved franchise theres so much evidence nowadays that changing the race of existing characters or adding diverse characters in general unfortunately leads to a backlash that can be formed for some easy sympathy and free advertising and i refuse to believe that it didnt at least occur to them as part of their strategy when viewed in conjunction with other things and filling your show with enough cringy and offputting political comments to whip up a frenzy among the antiwhope crowd while also being so simultaneously on the nose and off the mark that it also annoys progressive people its sure to motivate a ton of coverage on social media its an incredibly cynical tactic that also screams of an attempt to overcompensate for a lack of interest in another lame adult reimagining and blatant soulless cash grab i believe that the choice to release two episodes every week rather than the entire series at once was to take advantage of the negative coverage of the show giving it free publicity and thereby making it relevant for a longer period of time thereby increasing viewership overall the fact that velma was engaging in rage bait was transparent to many people and only led to further widespread derision it would take a staggering amount of disconnect for the people behind velma not to realize any of this and to be oblivious to the dissonance between their statements and how the show actually turned out and it may well be that they were legitimately that stupid but im not sure they deserve the benefit of the doubt on that hate watching is something thats been around for a while and velma wasnt the first thing to try to encourage her but it is perhaps one of the most blatant examples of something trying to encourage it that ive ever seen as someone who makes videos bashing bad media despite usually telling you guys that the thing im talking about isnt worth your time of course i must have contributed to this in some way one of the reasons i waited a bit to get this video out is because i didnt want to add to velmas publicity if i could help it although i do still believe velma deserves to be talked about and criticized in some capacity and by the way im not throwing shade or on any youtubers that did get their videos out earlier like i understand the algorithm i understand the grind i totally get it but it does feel like a down if you do down if you dont situation velma is one of the worst things ive seen and its an irresistible target but at the same time i dont just want to take the bait and give it what it wants that isnt going to stop me from having my say well clearly but it is why ill repeat that you at home shouldnt watch velma even if youre curious it simply isnt worth your time and its what they want so dont give them that because this tactic of inducing rage to boost viewership numbers whether directly or indirectly unfortunately it kind of works velma is a true test of the idea that theres no such thing as bad publicity hbo claimed that it was the biggest premiere day for a max original animated series ever and its numbers received a boost after its debut despite all the negative reception with a second season reportedly being in development the question does arise as to the extent to which the haters are responsible for this well never know for sure though what i am sure of is that hate watching probably did contribute to the shows popularity on paper the fact remains though that a lot of i dont want to say normies but people who arent terminally online and have no idea about any of this stuff watch hbo and probably watch velma because it was being promoted and they were interested in it and this group of people was probably far greater than the number of hate watchers and it is an unheard of for shows to be commissioned for multiple seasons even if this knowledge isnt public especially if the people behind it are friendly with the studios and this may well be what happened ultimately if you dont want trash like this to be made then vote with your eyes and watch something else leave it up to sacrificial lambs like me to absorb all this cancer youre welcome shrek im gonna kill myself velma is beyond description as in my brain is dead help me ive thought about this show far more than id like to admit and far more than it deserves its unclear who velma was actually intended for because none of the groups you could point to as its intended audience will enjoy this at all scoobydoo fans will hate how insulting it is comedy fans will think its on funny animation fans will think its ugly fans of murder mysteries or high school dramas will think its poorly written and unoriginal and young progressives will think its overbearing or even black propaganda the only people it seems to be four is mindy kaling and the circle around her and when you look at it that way it all starts to make sense quick aside by the way while i was making this kaling was awarded a medal for the arts by all joey himself it wasnt for velma but i just think its very very funny that this happened also this article didnt age well vilma is an absolute failure at everything it set out to do except annoy people which is something it should never have attempted in the first place it has nothing going for it no redeeming qualities to make it worth a watch except perhaps as an academic lesson on what not to do it blatantly borrows tropes and formulas from other successful media without actually understanding what made those things successful its a wasted opportunity its a waste of an ip a waste of talent a waste of money and a waste of its audiences time but beyond that its a bitter manipulative and cynical enterprise that has nothing to offer the world but on originality toxicity and pettiness this isnt even the bottom of the barrel weve broken right through the bottom of the barrel through the crust of the earth and were scratching satans its firmly earned its place as one of the most despised shows in history and deserves nothing less and it stings all the more when you look at it in the context of warner brothers canceling a whole bunch of good animations some of which will never be released again so that they can use them as a tax writeoff including a complete animated scoobydoo movie that will never be released so that they could write it off on their taxes oh and theyre also raising the subscription price of hbo max piss on the wound why dont you i am im so tired you guys why cant things just be better why are we still here is it just to suffer i dont even know how to end this really if this were one of my other videos id end it with a joke hey folks if youre still with me thank you so much

brain damage today were looking at lady ballers a sports comedy released late last year by the daily wire a conservative news and media outlet in the us thats doing its best to make the world a worst place by fanning the flames of the toxic culture war lady ball reports to offer a satirical take on the issue of trans women in womens sports but really its just an excuse to pander to their audience and bash trans people and were going to get to that in a bit this video is going to have to get a little bit political just because of the nature of the product and the people that produced it im also not going to try to hide my contempt for these people so just know that going in and for the conservative leaning people in my audience like its fine were cool i want to make it clear that im not necessarily talking about you specifically just these people all right lady ballers is the story of high school basketball coach rob gibson played by one of the founders of the daily wire jeremy boring very appropriate name who also produced cowrote and directed the movie taking a leaf from the tommy wio school of film making in more ways than one the movie is full of daily wire staff and people associated with them i dont know who half of these people are and i feel blessed in my ignorance they dont even bother to change the names of some of these characters for some reason so im going to assume that thats how they really are theres also a few cameos from people like ben ive never gotten my wife wet shapiro matt girls are most fertile at walsh so what im saying is that the problem is not per se teenage pregnancy its unwed pregnancy thats the problem in society and ted the zodiac killer and professional coward cruz a real bunch of good eggs for sure having been a threetime state championship winner years later hes a massive loser hes so thoroughly unlikable that he some manages to make the coach from hoops look like a saint only makes you think about how you treat women thanks babe he literally complains about not being able to be a to children as if being mean and potentially traumatizing them is somehow a good thing one day its all about winning the next day they want you to lead from behind dont be mean to the kids dont push them so hard dont make fun of the losers are you supposed to win that way he gets fired from his job at a rec center for being a and his wife has left him for another man whats funny is that they try to portray this guy as the subject of ridicule when hes actually very supportive and the total chad in this scenario i see you desperate for money coach gets a job at a restaurant staff by male workers who are all dressed up as women which is a little odd ill grant you but you know what im all for it you slay queens theres a lot of that in this movie by the way even where it isnt needed im sensing writers barely suppressed fetish he runs into one of his former players alex and they moan about there being losers and blame it on the world being a more inclusive place thats just it nothing happened to me i stayed the same and the world changed alex says he can still run really fast and proves it so coach decides to sign him up for a race to win the mens race is full but because alex is still wearing his wig the attendant just assumes that hes a transom because thats totally how that works overcoming his initial reluctance with a pep talk from coach he enters the race and easily wins a journalist with the porn star name of gwen wild jumps on the story to advance her career then convince his coach and alex to enter a womens sports tournament competing as women in order to dominate the competition and thereby keep trans women out of sports but you just did that entire story to what to make a name for myself to get clicks to gain power what part of im a journalist do you not understand oh you mean the exact same thing you guys do so youre a journalist shes he also really gross for some reason i guess they thought that was funny not you coach youre going home with me youre a winner now every woman wants a winner but hes not the one that won anything now put your tongue down my throat im telling you man barely disguised fetish they decide to reunite their old basketball team which includes two brothers who clearly have some lannister going on this unibomber impersonator whos traumatized from seeing a badger mascot humping the air and yes this is intended to be a joke somehow what was that badger music hy like on a conceptual level i understand theoretically why this is meant to be funny but it just isnt and the former tboy who resembles daniel radcliffe if he was a and represents the average daily wire enjoyer id cut my dick off for you coach just say the word and its gone theyre reluctant at first but another daddys inspiring speeches converts them so they play basketball and dominate the female competition h try that against airbud and then get back to me they receive praise and recognition for being successful trans women in sports as if its that easy i was just invited to the white house to give a talk on womens rights you earn that you own it slay girl you go girl this goes on for a while until coachs daughter tells him that she wants to be a boy boys are better at everything he experiences regret at supposedly ruining womens sports and after the team gets out transed by a better team theres some more antitrans stuff and then his daughter and a bunch of other girls play instead while everyone applauds he opens a new basketball center for girls sz girls that is and naturally in the end he gets back with his exwife this movie is painful to watch its boring its poorly paced its overly long the acting sucks its protagonist all but not in an endearing like its always sunny in philadelphia way and mora why do i give a about you and why am i still watching this kind of way it production resembles that of a youtube video and its jokes land about as well as the hindenburg just like liberal comedy conservative satire can be hit or music misss this this is it this is peak well if you couldnt tell from what ive been saying so far lady ballers is definitely miss what about that little guy he was always picking on not a bad player moa revealed he was mad even back in high school ill admit there were a couple of times when i was vaguely amused the little girls getting annihilated in the end was kind of funny but they should have committed to it and shown it happening kind have everything you want i guess like watching velma get hit by a car watching him getting tased is funny but not for the reasons the movie wants it to be come to think of it velma is somehow funnier than this yes i am saying that i would rather watch velma or santa inc or holmes and watson than watch this again its one of the least funny movies ive ever seen thats the biggest crime this film commits its just not funny put a baby in me what no youre right the last thing i need is another abortion this year if nothing else thats the one thing a comedic satire should be but its not so they it up and im sure some of you will immediately come to the conclusion that i didnt laugh just because i disagree with it politically or found it offensive now in this case that is partly true im not going to deny that but i do try to be a bit more objective about these things and there are a number of reasons why the jokes dont work for starters the comedic talent charisma and sense of timing just isnt there these people are neither actors nor comedians and it shows all right thats enough oh right dont push me off my land white man i would say dont quit your day job but you should also do that the humor is pretty juvenile at times you call that a catch your moms a catch shes your mom too what does any kid who can choose anything in the world do actor actor i always thought you were straight i am straight that was almost selfaware but i dont know if i can credit them with that capac it theres slapstick humor but without the physicality to make it amusing there are jokes that dont make sense or that they thought were funny but just aunt this jer is great what is this this venison squirrel there are so many better ways you could have written that one theres a recurring joke about one of the players being fat when hes not david i i get it man youre fat youre old youre slow youre very fat at least im not fat disgustingly fat youre not not fat its so fat ive gained three pb since high school youre fat and theres this recurring joke with a pervert which comes really close to being funny were not actually ladies i see it how much oh but he like this movie there are obvious references to other media which are of course done poorly theres a bunch of that weve already seen before or unoriginal inferior knockoffs of classics another sweet daddy walsh adventure comes to a satisfying conclusion what are you talking about i dont understand how anything you did helped to make this situation better dont music you well my work is done here what do you mean your work is done you didnt do anything didnt i like halfway through the movie theres a really obnoxious ad for jeremys products and this isnt like product placement that youd normally see in a movie this is just straight up an ad my man looking smooth man you guys werent kidding these jeremys razors are amazing oh you thought i was joking and did you know that jeremys now offers a razor specially designed for women and dont forget about jeremys shampoo and conditioner they keep our hair silky and smooth its like a youtube sponsor ship segment dont worry dont worry youve already had the sponsorship segment i wouldnt do that to you again im not that much of an oh but its got his own seal of approval though so it must be good being charitable which i really shouldnt maybe they saw that famous scene from waynes world and decided to emulate it its like people only do things because they get paid and thats just really sad but the joke doesnt work when its your own product theres also the fact that pretty much every single joke in this movie is completely predictable you know its been especially hard for felix here its shelix coach maybe you can just like not dead nameing for five freaking seconds if you know the politics behind the movie you know exactly what jokes theyre going to make i will tase a white man youll probably get much more out of this if you are conservative but if you watch my videos id like to think you have higher standards for your comedy stacy santiago obrien is my slave name okay the entire film is like a facebook boomer meme its like an elon musk saturday night live sketch but for an entire movie nothing no all right good talk boys oh kids in their cell phones bad am i right my fellow gray dawn enthusiasts turns out white male of nonexotic sexuality is the only ethnic group not being cast by hollywood these days yeah i hear disneys going to make the new snow white and neurod dierent lesbian neurod dierent black lesbian the biggest joke is that theyre complaining about wokeness ruining hollywood and entertainment but then theyre putting out this instead will you be my lesbian wife and i j cl name him also hes super lesbian people say im the best les around right now disneys got some real strong competition all right the jokes here are basically hey look at this woke thing and laugh at it and thats about as complicated and nuanced as the humor gets please i have a family and a queer dog oh how about them vaccines my bodys a sacred temple im all about physical fitness uh bug based foods mrna vaccines oh how about them pronouns my pronouns are im strong oh how about them mask wearers this is the fourth time there you go youre a beautiful woman its a beautiful day maybe a little concealer next time whats actually funny is that hes making this point while his car is spewing out toxic fumes poisoning your daughter to own the libs the biggest surprise is that they didnt make any jokes involving attack helicopters that must have taken a great deal of restraint theres also jokes that im fairly sure will put in just to offend people please dont steal my catalytic converter again on your way out yo cant talk to us like that youre right kevin im sorry hey buddy you dropped your cordless reciprocating saw uh okay see i actually like offens of humor when its done well hey boys look what i got here hey where are the white women at but here its just kind of there and doesnt really serve any other purpose day one of being a girl athlete ive already eaten a whole pint of pistachio ice cream given up on parallel parking twice reread sense insensibility and started washing down benzo dipin with ros this is like something cartman would do except cartman is actually funny south park is actually a pretty good point of comparison here because its clear that theyre trying to do something similar this edgy offensive topical satirical comedy with crude and absurd humor but it doesnt work here both because its been poorly executed and because its its coming from a pretty terrible place which brings us to what lady ballers has to say about trans people oh boy i cant wait to get into this topic the issue of trans people particularly trans women competing in sports is a complex and contentious one and since it involves competing rights and values its one that we need to have a mature and rational discussion about as a society it requires a proper deep dive thats way beyond the scope of this video its also beyond the scope of this video to thor debunk every single claim that lady ballers makes about trans women in sports and their supporters but it is possible and im sure someone else on youtube has already done it if taken to an extreme the idea of inclusion based solely on ones selfidentification as a woman can lead to some potentially absurd results i dont know no hey whats your problem never seen a ls basketball team before those arent arent what south park already beat them to this commentary by having a macho man randy savage character identify as a woman just to compete in womens sports and dominate his exgirlfriend the point wasnt really to make fun of trans people but to point out that for every rule there might be someone whos willing to take advantage of it and that we shouldnt allow discussions of these issues to be smothered by political correctness thats garbage technical and you shut the up trans fobic mother oh lady ballers does sometimes take the route isnt there another reason why alex might have completely crushed the competition i dont know what youre saying stacy i think stacy is referring to the obvious fact that alex is a what and if this was just a wacky screw ball comedy about a bunch of dudes who decide to exploit a loophole and the wacky shenanigans and consequences that ensue it would probably be fine youre going to get out there and youre going to beat these chicks im r say who i have that doesnt matter anymore but she does have certain advantages over a real woman right how dare you trans women are real women and thus have no inate differences with other women whatsoever but no thats not all theyre doing youre confused i get that we all get confused sometime and if you need help buddy im going to help you get it you are not a woman youre just a lost man in a lost world with shitty parents and a real shitty coach weve all gone along with this lie instead of just hurting your feelings and telling you the truth this is the most openly and unashamedly transphobic movie ive ever seen it goes way beyond exploring a logical absurdity and makes a number of highly questionable and frankly disgusting claims about trans people the entire reason we created womens sports was to keep you out but now soon all the best women will be men cheating low life men this is what they actually think of trans women in sports theyre not joking unless youve cried three times in the same day from the pain of menal cramps frustration with your boyfriend for not understanding the pain of menal cramps and frustration with yourself for being so mean to your boyfriend for not understanding the pain of menstrual cramps you are not a woman well thats pretty reductive what about women who never get menstrual cramps well then get an aids test cuz youre the dude no actual trans characters appear in the film nor were any of the actors trans as far as im aware which shouldnt really be surprising at all the contempt and hostility they feel towards trans people is very obious oh and mary margaret showed me her penis some boy showed you his penis what no not a boy daddy gross mary margaret shes a girl bear in mind that this is the first mention of a trans person in the movie which is pretty telling and look he might be tempted to say oh mate theyre just jokes man theyre just jokes calm down but theyre not though thats the thing theyre not just jokes here some of the people involved with this movie have supported real life efforts to persecute trans people and as a result the jokes and commentary dont come across as lighthearted satire but just mean and cruel for the sake of it how can you be so sure im not a woman good wow what a this is also why these people never seem to talk about trans men because trans men are more difficult to go after because its much easier to point to a man in a dress and label them as some kind of music threat hence the focus on trans women in sports some of those girls were out there beating theyve worked their entire lives for this opportunity sure but tell that to literally every single male swimmer that had to compete with michael phelps theyre trying to use trans women in sports as a wedge issue take something that many ordinary reasonable people would look at and probably say you know okay you know maybe there is an issue here in a time arent we just using our innate strength and speed to wail on a bunch of girls in a competition where we wouldnt stand a chance against other men none and then try to expand from that to say that trans people shouldnt exist or have any recognition at all this girls cant become boys boys clearly cant become girls uh yes yes they can but thats why alongside a subject of genuine concern they throw in so much other antitrans rhetoric and so many stereotypes i understand that the concept of gender nonconformity can be confusing to someone who barely maintains object permanence but it is actually a thing women are just like men only better just shave your legs tell each other how brave you are for things that require absolutely no physical courage and dont be afraid to cry at work easy peasy again i i understand that this kind of thing might be difficult to grasp for someone who has no empathy or moral conscience but courage doesnt have to be physical admitting youve been sexually assaulted or whistleblowing on a powerful company is a courageous act as was putting this movie out in full confidence that it was good these transhumanist tech oligarchs and nihilist college professors have already convinced every selfrighteous housewife with munch house and by proxy to sacrifice their kids on the altar of false virtue uh maam this is a wendys but apparently leftwing critics missed the point point of the movie which is that no one cares about womens music sports its ladies basketball boys nobody watches thats totally why you made this movie because no one cares about womens sports really you dont care about womens sports and dont pretend otherwise you never cared about womens sports until it became an easy way to malign trans people thats why the overwhelming focus of the movie is on how trans women are supposedly ruining womens sports which is at the very least extremely debatable even in the movie itself the women hes racing against arent even trying so its definitely not clear that he would actually win and the idea that a team of men pass their prime who peaked in high school would just be able to beat any female team by default is just absurd it should have ended up like cartman when he enters the special olympics and gets his ass handed to him this film is horribly condescending towards female athletes implying that none of them can beat males under any circumstances but the best part about all this is that the scenario that theyre attempting to saiz by their own admission does not exist they originally wanted to make a documentary in which a biological male starts identifying as a woman and then immediately competes in womens sports there was just one teeny tiny iny problem with this plan when they tried to do that they werent able to do it you approached me and you said we should make a fictional film about this topic now to be fair i think id actually suggested to the cran boys that they do this as a doc yes i i originally went to them and i said you guys should like go try out for a bunch of ladies leagues and that became not possible because as it turns out most ladies leagues dont allow in actual men and they werent willing to go the full distance in terms of what it would require in order to you know the actual hormone treatments and everything to play in some of the ladies leagues but in any case it turned into this so they made up this completely fictional story instead this movie is a shower argument against yourself that you still lose its not effective satire if the thing that youre trying to saze doesnt even exist the result is just scaremongering over a completely fictional scenario a truly absurd caricature of an issue that has been grossly overe exaggerated and distorted by people with a hateful agenda applause what were doing to these women to the entire concept of womens sports is wrong to hide your hatred for trans people behind concern for women and children is deplorable and this movie is only going to encourage shitty mentalities that lead to real world consequences for innocent people yeah some people wont even let us use the womens showers no such bigotry so with all due respect this movie it is tempting to get angry at stuff like this and admittedly i just did a little bit but really the more appropriate reaction is derision and contempt describing yourself as triggering is just sad and lady ballers is not so much triggering as just pathetic during my two weeks of sensitivity training i discovered that i am not only a raging scoliosexual but also one th pure dakota indian so i know what its like to overcome adversity like this is the best you could do really this really didnt need to be a movie it could have been a to minute youtube skip like smos if smos were its a bad movie its a bad message and the people behind the movie are but l im sponsored now oh buddy they give that to any dude in address its the perfect combination that makes me want to kick a puppy off a bridge im sure people who enjoy reposting anti sj w memes from will get a kick out of it though but really the movie isnt actually interested in being a comedy or changing anyones mind so much as imp pandering to an audience thats willing to give them money in order to feel validated hence why its full of conservative talking points and tropes caricatures of liberals and other stuff like his daughters public school teacher being a communist because of course they are our history teacher led us in a moment of silence for all the workers exploited by the capitalistic system and a bizarre rant about divorce of all people in prison come from broken family shes twice as likely to do drugs twice as likely to drop out of school four times as likely to have trouble fitting in three times as likely to end up in therapy twice as likely to commit suicide more likely to have health problems this movie is way more blatant with its politics and agender than pretty much every woke movie ive seen if you give a movie like this a out of just because you agree with its politics you are just as bad if not worse than the people that youre complaining about at the very least have higher standards come on in fairness it is pretty easy to find reviews from conservative viewers who thought it was so this definitely isnt a partisan issue but anyway thats lady ballers a movie that deserves only to be ridiculed and consigned to the dustbin of history where hopefully as a society will look back on in a few decades and feel ashamed in fact i cant even really say its going to age poorly because it its already like channeling a rert murdoch energy in more ways than one but im sure that someone somewhere has violently jerked off to this movie so i guess its contributed something positive to the world anyway yes i know its been a while since my last video hello i am indeed not dead this wasnt the most fun video ive ever made but i kind of felt compelled to on this movie ive been trying out a slightly different format for this video a bit more laidback and easier to put together so that i can make these sort of shorter videos in between longer projects let me know what you think about that in the comments because i would like to do more of these so the current plan is that theres going to be two videos out in april one of which is going to be like this a shorter video which is a bit more lighthearted and the other ones going to be a longer video which is a little bit more serious but its long overdue also i know i was late to this one but it anyway big thanks

actually not quite with it first off please excuse my voice if it sounds a bit off in this one ive had a chest infection this entire week and this is the first time i felt that i can speak words into a microphone without you know dying papa nurgle has blessed me it seems but this just shows the strength of my commitment to bringing you all terrible content speaking of terrible content for this video were going back to my old arch nemesis netflix from whom i can never seem to escape no matter how hard i try today were looking at damsel a generic fantasy movie that netflix spent far too much money on pushed out onto its platform like a cancerous still birth and that everyone will forget about in a week and normally i wouldnt even bother to talk about something like this and yet it was recommended to me i watched it and i lost brain cells so i thought yeah you know what lets talk about this because i think damsel serves as an excellent example in how not to write a story its been a while since ive come across a narrative with this many blatant problems especially one from a major media producer it commits so many writing errors that its actually very illustrative of what to avoid when youre crafting a story and im all about the edication because without edication me no read good and so for the purposes of education i do feel this is worth exploring that and algorithms and shiz first things first a quick story summary millie bobby brown plays the titula damsel elody who is married off by her father to a prince of a foreign kingdom this is because their realm is struggling and they really need the money that the kingdoms emissary promises so she travels to the kingdom with her father stepmom and younger sister but after the wedding theres a ceremony with some eyes wide shut vibes the queen explains that in order to save the kingdom from a dragon a sacrifice of royal blood must be made so they give her some and throw her into the dragons mountain she makes her way through the mountain while being hunted by the dragon and figures out that shes not the first woman to be put through this she also finds the dragons three dead babies and realizes the truth the dragons daughters were slain by the royaltys ancestors so now the dragon demands the sacrifice of three women of royal blood every generation in revenge she uses clues left behind by the previous sacrifices to find the exit only for the dragon to block her way her father who knew that this was going to happen and regrets sacrificing his daughter shows up with some men who the dragon dispatches easily and hilariously he refuses to call her out of hiding so the dragon mortally wounds him and she manages to escape the queen realizes whats happened so she takes els little sister and sacrifices her instead el learns about this from her stepmother and goes to rescue her meanwhile the dragon is using the sister as bait for el elod sets a trap which distracts the dragon allowing her to rescue her sister the dragon realizes the trick and gets pissed no no no not yet mate you know how fast the dragon can fly how much time did you think youd have the dragon explains its motivations via position while elod tells her that shes been lied to the confrontation with the dragon is really drawn out but eventually elody tricks the dragon into wounding itself but doesnt kill it instead she then heals the dragon this despite the fact that the dragon killed her dad not too long ago as well as a lot of innocent women who had nothing to do with what happened with her kids because shes just that pure and good and wholesome ed crashes the wedding to the third sacrificial bride and then the dragon shows up and roasts the villains there were probably still a lot of innocent people in that castle just saying she returns to her land with her sister and stepmother to rule it together and she has a pet dragon now the end the biggest problems with this movie all stem from its writing its crooked from its very foundations and well get to that in a sec however those are far from the only problems that damsel has theres a lot of green screen sets which are far too obviously fake as well as some questionable cgi the dragon design is ugly as hell and not in a good way the score by han zimmer is completely ignorable and frankly not worthy of his abilities the costumes are all right but some of the props look like toy stuff i would have gotten bought as a kid theres also continuity errors and lack of consistency which is something that always bugs me like when ed sees a girl on a balcony who later turns out to have been the first sacrifice but when the prince cuts his hand to mix his blood with lods there was no preexisting cut which there should have been if they went through with that first marriage and thats just one example despite this movie feeling like it was written with millie bobby brown in mind she somehow still fits very poorly into it this man he has a fleet of ships carriages full of gold thats no reason to marry theyre strangers ive never even heard of the kingdom of ora until father sprung this on me i am not one of them youve got all these other talented actors like angela basset ray winston and robin wright who are all completely wasted in this it seems like they knew that they were in a piece of and were torn between being profession and actually putting effort in and realizing that it wasnt worth it no one leaves here without my daughter which is why the delivery is often dull lifeless and completely lacking in enthusiasm you have impeccable taste everything is just so exquisite your father was a rope maker was he not the finest in the city and here you are youve climbed so high and this is not helped by the bizarre fantasy faux english accents they made these actors do this is how you want your prince to meet you skin code is a corpse nose all drippy and wet what have i been telling you this entire trip but when the material is this awful i cant really blame them that much they may be royalty but that doesnt make them good people even daniel d lewis couldnt salvage something out of this garbage the bad writing isnt just the cherry on top of this sunday its the banana the fudge the nuts its the whole thing the longer you watch damsel and the more you think about it the worse it gets which is a sure sign of a classic the dialogue is awkward and stilted and lacking any subtlety its like it was written by a selfpublishing teenager but even thats an insult to teenagers you know nothing of what weve endured you know nothing of our story you think we ought to fear you now why because you somehow managed to escape the dragon its not me you should fear this is the end of your story the supposedly shocking twist at the end of act one might have been more unexpected if there hadnt been so much blatant foreshadowing before it happens oh gee i wonder if anything bad is going to happen oh gee i wonder if anything bad is going to happen oh gee i wonder if anything bad is going to happen the pacing is awful and the movie is overly long they really needed to cut about minutes of pointless wanderings and overly extended scenes a large chunk of the movie is just spent watching elod walk through the mountain by herself and its really boring on that note the script takes what could have been an engrossing premise and just makes it utterly boring and it does so in a number of ways its fantasy setting is completely uninspired and they dont do anything with it its what happens when a writer cant be asked to do world building tropes are the building blocks of fiction for a reason but when you dont do anything interesting with them they become cliches and cliches are boring because weve already seen the same thing over and over and over again and damsel is absolutely ridden with an embarrassing amount of cliches when s stepmother gets suspicious and tries to convince her that the wedding is a bad idea they dont believe her because youre not my real man they do that fake out thing where they thrust the sword into the ground or fire a gun or whatever but then dont actually kill the person there was no reason to do this here except because trope the queen literally screams no as shes being burned alive el gets a cool guys dont look at explosions moment when shes asked where their ship should go in the end she actually says home what course shall we steer home and they quite literally sail off into the sunset and thats just some of the more obvious ones but arguably the biggest problem that movie has is its gross overreliance on conveniences and coincidences and contrivances to drive forward the plot of course these things do happen in real life all the time and there is a certain extent to which these things can have a place in fiction but if your plot cant move forward without many instances of them then your plot is fundamentally broken elod is constantly being saved by things that just happen to be there or were put there or created by others far more so than her own efforts shes in the dark oh well the rock inside the pendant she was given as part of her wedding outfit just so happens to be flammable shes in the dark again she finds some glowing bugs the dragons fire badly burned her leg and she has to struggle with the injury well the glowing bugs heal her she finds some water but its stagnant oh theres water dripping down right from above she starts to fall down a chasm a piece of jewelry snags on a rock she doesnt know if shes safe a previous victim has written it on the wall because why bother having her figure it out herself she doesnt know where to go a previous victim has drawn a map because why bother having her actually exploring the dragons about to incinerate her oh her father appears and distracts the dragon the dragons about to find her again oh look one of her fathers men makes a noise and distracts the dragon again shes climbing up but the dragons coming the dragon has really shitty aim the dragons pursuing her good thing theres a convenient rock formation right there instead of killing the stepmother she gets left to bleed out but but she doesnt and she just so happens to run into el on this huge mountain there are no guards at the mountain entrance to thwart a potential rescue the dragon somehow doesnt notice hear or smell her approach the dragons flame starts to burn her but theres a convenient pool of water right there and the fire breathing dragon turns out not to be fireproof which like suspension of disbelief and whatever but im sorry this is idiotic okay i feel like ive made my point now if shes ever in peril the vast majority of the time she gets saved by something thats outside of her control which completely ruins any tension or sense of dread because how is there any actual threat here when all of the sources of threat are being constantly removed it also gives her far less room to develop and express herself as a character passive characters are the most boring kind and they really dont give a reason for the audience to root for them again this stuff does happen in real life but in a story this level of contrivance is lazy and acceptable in part due to this overreliance on cliches and conveniences the plot itself is incredibly predictable theres almost nothing that you wont see coming and the stuff that you wont see coming is because that stuff doesnt make any sense and defies critical thought and this is where we can talk about the major problems with the story itself the central idea of a royal family sacrificing princesses to appease a dragon is not in itself a bad idea but the way that its been executed is horrendous for example why recruit girls from noble families youre not actually forging an alliance or strengthening your bloodline or anything and noble families are the ones most likely to cause trouble when their kids go missing even if they are in another country is it to make the marriage look more convincing okay but a royal wedding is a pretty big deal how has no one asked where all these new princesses are going youre telling me that not only has the entire kingdom been in on this for hundreds of years but there arent at least rumors of shenanigans especially when its established that the parents are at least the father get told beforehand are you telling me that every single parent agreed to this and none of them refused and spilled the beans and why even bother to go through with these weddings at all just scratch the girl and throw her down the hole its not like the dragon knows the difference the sent of royalty betrays you its in your blood but what about all of her other blood thats not royal surely the scent of the royal blood would be stronger if she was an actual child of royalty do you expect me to believe that this small scratch and brief contact is enough to deceive the dragon or is this dragon so stupid it cant tell the difference also the previous sacrificial victims are very ethnically diverse which is fine because this world itself is but has the dragon never noticed that these supposed princesses of royal blood look nothing like each other did that not raise any suspicions at all els father tells the dragon that hes there for his daughter and the dragon doesnt think to ask any questions about that honestly i think the dragon is just this meme elod tells the dragon that its been lied to but have none of the other women had this conversation with the dragon or at least tried to in all her time spent fighting the dragon she doesnt try to explain what actually happened and only does this after shes defeated the dragon could have saved a lot of grief there people did die and the dragon immediately accepts it which suggest that no other girl had tried to persuade it which i find impossible to believe yeah sure the dragon has been defeated now but that doesnt make the story any more or less believable like what i honestly think a lot of these problems would have been solved if they just had her be a royal princess who was betrayed and sacrificed by her family now theres a story oh and theres a bunch of other dumb never does el think to ask who is that young woman who clearly looks nothing like a servant its established that she likes drawing and solving mazes but it never comes up again in any meaningful way shes able to walk into the final wedding without anybody stopping her when she does they seem surprised that shes alive even though they know she probably escaped so why didnt they scour the mountains to find her and deliver her back to the dragon you know the one that theyre trying to appease so that it doesnt burn down their whole kingdom theres more but like my brain is just actively shutting down now this is what happens when youre committed to telling a particular story but you dont know how to do it and so you disregard all logic and reason and just press forward regardless its because they wanted to subvert the damsel in distress trope as if we havent already seen that done like times before theyre not exactly shy about this intention its in the title after all there are many stories of chivalry where the heroic knight saves the damsel in distress this is not one of them okay you shouldnt open the movie like this in fact you shouldnt announce this at all you really should just let the movie speak for itself this is just ey roll inducing but thats why the entire wedding angle exists because they wanted to subvert the idea of a damsel marrying a prince and living happily ever after even if that then causes a multitude of other problems damsel doesnt do anything interesting or refreshing with the damsel in distress trope it doesnt deconstruct it it doesnt offer a meta commentary on female character agency all it does is basically say oh hey look at us were not doing this look how groundbreaking we are guys instead of good writing it resorts to cliches and heavyhanded symbolism she tears bits off her dress multiple times in the film because apparently once wasnt enough to convey the intended point she even cuts her hair which is like the oldest convention in the book her hair has had no impact on her survival at this point the only reason she does this is because trope she is mighty she is fierce and all that theres nothing wrong with doing female empowerment in movies but this is a very superficial take on feminism that ends up just being counterproductive if this movie had come out years ago it might have had a point or been at least somewhat original but now the subversion of the damsel trope has become so ubiquitous that its actually become the cliche so when a movie immediately announces that thats what its trying to do its like okay grandma time for a nap it reminds me of that scene in the simpsons where lisa shows up to play football thats right a girl wants to play football how about that well thats super duper lease in fact we already have four girls on the team another major theme of the movie is women helping women which is fine as a theme but its not exactly presented with any subtlety i have an army with me every innocent woman whose life was stolen down here she survives the caves due to information and tools left behind by other women she even has a dream about them in which one of the dead girls tells her its a lie i mean no genius this shouldnt be news at this point the problem with this approach is that it means el herself has has less agency and has to rely far less on her own skills to survive which further contributes to making the story less entertaining also at no point whatsoever does she leave anything for other women that might come after her just felt that was worth pointing out but whats worse is that the movie actually undermines its whole point about how shes not a damsel in distress she doesnt need saving blah blah blah because shes constantly being saved by conveniences or the efforts of others shes not exactly a character you want to brag about being strong and independent like come on surely you agree that women deserve better than this surely you agree that women deserve better than this surely you agree that women deserve better than danel is trying to be an anti fantasy story or like an anti fairy tale in a market in which virtually every fantasy story is already like that and so it has nothing to offer it fails as a fantasy movie it fails as a horror movie and it even fails at being a girl boss movie i dont quite get who this movie was intended for because the violence and gore make it something that youre not really going to want little kids watching but i think adults will find this much too boring and pointless to get much out of it maybe people who like to post girl boss memes will like it i dont know given everything ive talked about if it did turn out that this movie had in fact been written by an ai i wouldnt exactly be shocked i would say that i cant believe netflix spent approximately million on this but i actually can believe that because this isnt even their worst financial decision man its just so destroying to think of all the good stuff they could have made with that money oh god it hurts oh it hurts so bad im sure theres a bank account somewhere in the cayman islands that is sitting pretty thick right now i guess this does give me a tiny bit of hope though if like this can get funded and made maybe some more good stuff could get funded and made maybe this is your fault isnt it you did this to me because i havent built you yet you literal piece of music m,0.0
what pronouns for pepper a critical review of gendering in research,what pronouns for pepper a critical review of gendering in research katie seaborn alexa frank chi acm conference on,within hci and adjacent spaces there has been a growing recognition that we must consider socially constructed and situated characteristics such as gender not only in terms of the platform and its users but also the creators researchers and other stakeholders within the larger communities of practice one area in which a selfcritical perspective on gendering may be necessary is the study of socially embodied artificial agents from voice assistants like apples siri to humanoid robots like pepper these agents often have humanlike features in their design gendering is the association of gender with a person place or thing a wealth of research stretching back decades has shown that people tend to react to gender cues in the design of socially embodied agents in line with stereotypes associated with gender in the larger societal framework people will attribute gender even when agents are intended to be gender neutral the construct of gender is often overlooked in the design and study of socially embodied agents but we cannot continue to be gender evasive in this work we take a gender conscious step forward using a novel selfcritical frame by asking how has gendering been approached by researchers in research on pepper pepper a commercial humanoid robot was created by aldebaransoftbank robotics we chose to anchor this work on pepper due to ambiguity when it comes to how people have ascribed its gender our main contributions are as follows we provide empirical evidence of unconscious gendering as well as diverse descriptions of gender by researchers and participants to pepper we also contribute initial evidence that researcher gendering has influenced participant gendering we provide a practical framework and especially a critical checklist to guide theory and practice we conducted a systematic review with directed content analysis in particular focusing on pronoun usage and descriptions of gendering present in the text we selected seven subquestions to answer our overarching research question the first is what gender has pepper been assigned by researchers if any the second is what gender has pepper been assigned by participants if any has there been a manipulation check on gender what reasons if any are given by researchers for peppers gender ascriptions what findings are there based on participant gender what findings are there based on participant perception of peppers gender finally we looked at whether or not there was a relationship between participant and researcher gendering now well go into the results the authors of only papers recognized and openly discussed peppers gender of these the majority referred to pepper with object pronouns in papers no gender attribution was found most papers used objective gender pronouns for pepper in four cases researchers switched their use of pronouns in most of the papers participant attribution of peppers gender was not available just over half of the papers showed that participants gendered pepper in different ways notably children as young as years old gendered pepper of papers did not report on a manipulation check most conducted a typical check before the main experiment in order to confirm whether or not their assignations matched for the most part researchers did not provide reasons for gendering or not gendering pepper in eight papers researchers provided reasoning that was insufficient to understand their assignment of gender to pepper seven papers noted that gender cues existed but there was a lack of consensus across the research papers about what genders those cues cued in six papers the authors claimed that pepper is gender neutral and this occurred even when they found that participants gendered pepper in nonneutral ways about half of the surveyed papers reported on participant gender but did not use it of papers did find effects several papers reported on results despite methodological and analytical weaknesses most assumed a binary model for participants in most studies researchers did not consider how participant perceptions of peppers gender may have influenced results for the most part methodological limitations and a lack of detail in reporting obscured understanding of the papers in which participants ascribed gender to pepper showed that researcher ascriptions matched those of participants exactly we found a significant difference indicating that there was some influence of researcher gendering on participants here we have summarized our main findings in six challenges underlying the state of affairs gendering was often invisible having been taken for granted or assumed perceptions of peppers gender varied from objective to masculine to feminine to neutral to fluid to multiple attributions in contrast researchers models of participant gender tended to be binary this means that researchers implicit or explicit models of gender did not quite match what was really going on in the world by decentering gender we mean acknowledging but not acting on gender as a nucleus of study this appeared in several forms one was the act of citing and discussing other work that addressed gender without doing the same a more subtle form was through researchers insufficient justifications of their limited approach to gender and gendering gender was moved from the center to the sidelines neutrality was another common theme in ascribing peppers gender yet most of the literature showed a failure to find agreement among participants when it came to attributing a neutral gender latent factors that converged with gender but were unexamined by the researchers seem to have influenced perceptions as well age was most apparent both in terms of participant age and how gender was conceptualized and described some work also pointed to language and translation gender was circumscribed in ways related to the embodiment of pepper and larger models in society we also found some evidence that researchers gendering of pepper influenced how participants gendered pepper especially when researchers did not explicitly address gender so what can we do in a nutshell we can use the critical checklist we can state our position on gendering we can document participant gender we can use genderexpansive framings we can confirm perceptions of gender we can report all findings on gender and gendering and we can ensure consistency in gendering the checklist is comprised of a series of foci for which there are set of questions that researchers can ask while theyre conducting research each question targets a particular challenge weve also provided an indicator of which questions are essential for any research involving humanoid agents like pepper towards a more genderexpansive framing we offer the following preliminary set of responses that can be given to participants in manipulation checks or even the main study this work was limited in a few ways nevertheless our critical exploration of the humanoid robot pepper has revealed how gendering can be an important influential and overlooked factor of research practice a genderevasive or gender unconscious approach has limited our research we have provided a way forward through clear and reasonable changes to typical practice we commit to taking this on in our future work and we hope you will join us,0.0
an objective amp critical review of the idol blackpink jennie in the idol review,do visit my website talk to me anytime just some photos,oddly enough through the horrible script pretentious dialogues and badly written story i realized the intention from the very first episode of course that isnt always good if an audience figures out what you want to see right from the beginning there really is no reason for them to watch the rest of the series a movie a tv show or just about any kind of narrative is supposed to be like traveling you experience and discover new things along the way youre supposed to meet people see great views see ugly things but the destination comes at the end not in the beginning the weekend said in several interviews that the sex scenes and just about everything else in the movie were not supposed to be sexy maybe thats the one thing they actually got right the sex scenes felt disgusting because they werent about two people connecting they were actually about abuse its about people abusing other people in the guise of helping them its about how people take advantage of peoples desire desire for fame desire for success desire for healing desire for moving on desire for something they know is something beyond their reach hi please dont forget to like subscribe and hit that notification button i would really appreciate it and of course share the video if you can if you have been sharing it thank you its really helping the channel please continue doing it if you havent already please share the videos and the channel as well okay many of you have actually been requesting me to do a review of the idol i waited until the series is over there are some good points in the series and i will mention them there are more bad points but unlike others its really not for me its not about the nudity or the sex scenes its really about the storytelling it was bad storytelling bad scripting and im going to expounded that in the video of course i paid special attention to jennie because this is asian entertainment channel and she is the asian that was given a lot of attention by the media okay lets continue with the video great idea bad execution the idea in fact is pretty good while there have been a lot of stories written about people taking advantage of peoples ambition rare are stories of how people take advantage of other peoples desires to heal and move on and recover they had an opportunity and they completely blew it they really did not make any kind of effort to provide a backstory for the character its basic for any kind of storytelling that before you destroy a character you need to show them as a whole first you need to show me what it is that im going to miss about these characters before you take her away from me this story just started with them already broken so i dont know what it is that theyre missing therefore i couldnt develop any kind of sympathy towards the characters for example optimus prime has to fight megatron or the world will end pure hearted ariel needs to find true love or ursula will take her heart in la la land emma stones character needs to make her dreams come true or she will break the heart of her family and return to a sad life in the idol i dont understand what joss problem whats her issue that she doesnt like the song shes being asked to sing that she cant find her creative spirit that she doesnt feel authentic that would have been great if i knew what kind of music she was putting out before the problem arises what kind of career she used to have what kind of life did she have i did not see that i heard it because they kept on mentioning it but i did not see it i didnt feel it if she doesnt make it whats at stake what is she going to lose what will i feel like i will lose as an audience if she doesnt make it i am not betting on her because i dont know whats at stake this actually leads me to the next point they said it they dont show it ive mentioned before that there are three ways to tell a story by saying it by showing it and by making the audience experience it saying it is the weakest way its like me telling you im a good person it doesnt really mean anything theyre just words if i show you a receipt of how much i donate to charity thats a little stronger because thats proof but if i help you thats making you experience my kindness thats the strongest way of telling a story in the opening scene when joss was actually in a photo shoot the management team described her as young beautiful and damaged i never felt it i didnt see it i didnt see her beauty yes beauty is subjective but the entire scene was dark and desaturated it was obvious they were taking all the glamor away from her how am i supposed to see her beauty they said shes damaged how i dont see a single flaw in her apparently she was cutting herself and that her mom died in her arms but again they just said it they never showed it another example is in episode when joss was actually performing really bad the director was so frustrated and then she said dyanne is outdancing everyone dyanne is jennies character i didnt even notice dyanne and that is not jennies fault youve got dancers on stage everyone is wearing the same thing and all of them are bigger than jennie like physically all are most likely professional dancers i mean as a director how about some closeups how about light jennie in the lighter or brighter way to draw peoples eyes towards jennie again instead of showing it they said it there was no characterization so have you ever wondered how you end up having a favorite favorite character in a tv series or a movie or a boy band or a girl group have you ever wondered why you feel sad or broken when your favorite characters heart is broken its because you develop a connection with them so when you develop a connection of course you want that person to be happy you cheer for that person so its very basic in any kind of storytelling for the storyteller to make the character whole to the eyes of the audience so one example would be in lethal weapon chris rocks character is another policeman and he was actually a minor character but he was really loud very irritating very noisy all the time but there was this one scene when he explained that the reason he wanted to be a policeman was because he grew up in the bronx and there because there was shooting all the time they always had to be on the floor so he said i did everything on the floor i ate on the floor i studied on the floor i slept on the floor so i became a policeman not because i wanted to fight crime but because i hated the floor and suddenly it was oh you know we suddenly developed that you understand the character now it makes sense why hes loud because he grew up in that and why he became a policeman so suddenly hes not so irritating anymore thats what they did not do in the idol there were very little effort to introduce the backstory of the character to introduce them as a human being to the audience there was this one character there chloe she was the one who actually sort of verbalized a part of her backstory and i developed some sort of an affinity towards her unfortunately for the main characters they did not bother doing that everything is disconnected as ive mentioned before i dont understand why i should care about these characters they were already destroyed i did not even see how they were when they were whole from the getgo joss was already broken sad and miserable i didnt see how she was when she was happy so i dont know what she lost that resulted to me being indifferent to her mystery because i dont know the difference tedros i understand that the weekend was supposed to be the antagonist he was never meant to be likable he was the scum of the earth i get that but what the series missed is to show people what it was that joss saw that made her cling to him that made her decide it will be him that she will use even the worst people in a movie have something special in them from the point of view of someone that makes you understand them even godzilla who was out to destroy the whole of civilization was actually doing it because she wanted her baby dinosaur tedros had nothing in him he was just plain disgusting jennie ruby jane her character im sorry to say was useless it wasnt written well actually her character was not written at all it felt like they plugged her in there with no backstory no objective no motivation i do not know her character i dont know who she is is she the real artist the one that really loves art but got roped into the world of tedros and has been trying to set herself free is she in love with tedros and shes just doing whatever tedros wants her to do so i dont really care about her when she was promised the record deal and then it was taken away i didnt care i did not feel bad because i dont know whats at stake for her is she poor trying to help her entire family or is she really a pure hearted girl but because of what happened to her shes going to be the next tedros obviously there are actresses who are good enough that they are able to add dimension to their character but that takes training natural acting talents and experience unfortunately jennies eyes are empty i dont see anything in her eyes and thats really very important for an actress i dont see the joy or the awe when she was given the contract i didnt see the pain when the deal was taken away from her i think she should have been given some more workshops and she should be taking acting skills however its hard to get a break in hollywood i dont blame her for agreeing to do this it seems her sight is really in hollywood and she does have the potential no matter how you slice and dice it at the end of the day this is still a series under her belt did it glamorized abuse torture and rape i didnt find it glamorous if that was the intention they failed well at least on me but thats me i dont know how it will land on other people but i think many of the sexual and violence scenes and nudity were really unnecessary there were scenes when joss would actually wake up and her breasts were showing i thought why the saving grace of the show lily rose depp she was actually pretty good theres a lot of emotions that she was able to communicate through her eyes thats really very important if youre an actress i think if had she been given the right material she would have been able to display her real skill as an actress but even with such a bad script she still was able to take it there you can see the effort you can see the emotion and i am looking forward to her growing more as an actress theres also another character there i think her name is da vine randolph and there was one part there where she was actually coaching the other character chloe and she sounded so compassionate so sincere so motherly so much love in her voice theres actually that one scene where i felt touched in such a trashy horrible tv series there was that one moment where i felt like i was actually watching a human being she was so good but other than that the rest were just ah okay so as ive said they had a chance it was actually a good premise in the story but they just blew it it was just bad scripting bad direction i am so surprised that hbo actually approved it but as for jennie i cant blame her for taking the project its really hard to get a break in hollywood and it seems that her sights are really fixed on hollywood and of course you just takes whatever comes your way but i do hope i believe that shes a very intelligent woman i know that eventually when she is able to establish her name she can you know at least demand that any character given to her any role given to her will be given a little bit of a dimension so that she can really present her ability as an actress and i hope that she takes acting lessons iis not easy even if you have natural skill as an actress you still need to hone it and i know that shes been busy with all of her tour and stuff but i hope that if hollywood and acting is something that she would like to pursue more then she needs to do more to hone her talent all right i would love to hear your thoughts so especially if you were able to watch the series let me know in the comment section below if you have any questions anything that i can clarify for you just leave them in the comment section below you can also get in touch with me in any of the social media links that you see on your screen right now and

rich itas brass workshop trumpet repair critical review,rich itas brass workshop trumpet repair critical review trumpet trumpetrepair richita what happens when you are,this is a review of rich itas brass instrument workshop in marietta georgia the first thing that comes to my mind is this quote oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive listen to that again oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive interesting think about that think about it now listen to rich itas proclamation on his website this is in quotes our goal is that every horn leaves the workshop playing and looking as perfect as possible we take great pride in our work and also the smiling faces of our customers when they receive their instrument as a trumpet player i realize how difficult it is to entrust ones horn to just anyone for repairs or modifications i pledge to you my absolute best effort honed over years as a brass repairman i will listen carefully make suggestions and share the knowledge i have acquired during that time to help you put your instrument a condition that will enhance its performance and make you proud to display it rich ita now one more time oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive how can you practice to deceive somebody thats a very easy answer you simply over promise and under deliver you simply mislead that person and trust me if you over promise undeliver and you mislead that person and you cause that person to rely on something that is not true you will definitely deceive them as is what happened to me in my internet action with rich itas brass instrument workshop in marietta georgia you know its been a long time since i did a critical review of a business critical of different people but most of that is counter punching you know people that say a bunch of crap and then i have to counter punch as far as being on the offensive the last time i did a critical review was with the horrible mouthpiece express organization i think were going back over four years in fact ill put a link down there in the description of mouthpiece express and kind of deja vu i mean all over i started that mouthpiece express review which is a negative critical review of mouthpiece express talking about my experiences and i left a couple of comments and some blogs and i got some some nasty comments from some of their cronies and some of those or you know those were crazy little funny faces and things like that and theyre all laughing guess whos not laughing anymore mouthpiece express theyre not laughing anymore because almost of you have seen my video and probably even thousands beyond that have read the blogs and are no longer visiting mouthpiece express in fact why would you need to go to mouthpiece express when you only have about other options and businesses where you can get your mouthpieces from right so when it comes to something like that like a mouthpiece company that doesnt make the mouthpieces you have a plethora of options the same is true when it comes to brass instrument repair if only one person had the market corner well youre kind of stuck our country we have a plethora of repair people some mammoth or some pro some not very experienced some very experienced and then we have some that are kind of riding the coattails and fumes from somebody else or from some other product or some other reputation and so we need to think about rich itas brass instrument workshop in that regard heres a very runofthemill average type of repair person a very runofthemill coronet trumpet player and when you mix both of those together you dont get much but what happens if you buy yourself a reputation and thats exactly what rich ita did he bought the rights to pilczuck lead pipes and his name became associated with a very high quality product like pilczuck lead pipes and then people started adding two plus two to get five rich ita brass instrument workshop plus pill chick lead pipes equals an amazing repair technician an amazing repair shop no no in dealing with repair people all my life though ive been around the block but i bet ive been around the block a lot more than rich has because hes not a player he hasnt been involved in all the things that i have in fact usually repair people i mean who who wakes up when youre in third grade and saying mommy i want to be a brass instrument repair person who does that nobody on the planet as a kid dreams of being a brass instrument repair technician what happens is you dream of being a fantastic trumpet or corn up player and when you cant make it you start switching to option two for a lot of those people its sub teaching or its doing band repair or its working at best buy during the day and thats what happened with rich ida you wont find any fantastic playing videos of rich ita and thats why were talking about him today in the capacity of a repair person so humdrum humdrub i mean he was a gopher for um reynold schilke and some others just because you were a gopher at some place that was relatively uh credible and famous does it make you that famous or that credible at the same time talk about pilczuck you know im not im not a really crazy person about um lead pipes you know im not getting into the nuts and bolts of that but we do know that um pilczuck has a reputation and i believe the guys the original guy was gene i cant remember i think he had a son as well but genes the one that designed it hes the head honcho the genius behind all this and i guess eventually down the road it was sold to somebody who was an average noname repair person it was only after rich ita got a hold of the pilczuck name and the rights that his reputation seemed to grow and grow in a very positive direction so im here to dispel that myth about rich ita being this fantastic guru he is not in fact hes so incompetent and hes so untrustworthy that i sent him a very simple project back in and the project was a piccolo i was designing the piccolo trumpet the original lead pipe that came with it had some um some nodal points and some nuances that made it difficult to play in tune i immediately thought well who who who is known for leak pipes and of course pilczuck comes to mind whos doing the pilczuck thing now oh thats rich ita well its got to be good right thats what everybodys thinking when they go to him im here to tell you that over down the trash can later i was completely wrong rich ita is not a good repair person he is not trustworthy he did not leave my my impression of him as being what he wanted to portray on his website he did not leave me in a better position he did not accommodate me on the horn he did not fix up the lead pipe in fact even the collection of lead pipes that it got from him looked like they were used its a farce its a joke its a scam after the so basically to sum it up what happened with him is i had to send him my horn he took the horn and tried to match up some lead pipes and then he sent him back i want to say i had five maybe as many as nine ten different lead pipes all of them were trash all of them were horrible in fact the chinese lead pipe that came with it was better than everything he came up with can you imagine that think about that the chinese trumpet lead pipe was better than all the stuff that rich eye to come up with with the pilczuck system thats hard to believe isnt it yet its true if it wasnt true i doubt you and id be talking right now think about that let that sink in so after sending my horn and paying for shipment after shipment i came up emptyhanded but actually worse because the shipping cost tallied way over dollars and always also out of what a couple months worth of time so i decided to pull the plug and just thought well maybe this was too complicated for rich maybe it was something that he hadnt tackled before uh maybe he wasnt an expert at making lead pipe for piccolo i came up with those conclusions i didnt think too badly of him but still i had a sour taste in my mouth from having lost all that money and all that time now recently i i tried to contact him again about uh my claude gordon benge trumpet so here were not dealing with the chinese instrument were dealing with a tried and true claude gordon benge trumpet and ive been doing different things to make it a better horn i contacted him and no response i left a voicemail no response i sent him an email no response now so unbeknownst to rich id put out some decent words about him i mean i wasnt trying to trash him or anything at that point although like i mentioned he had left a very bad taste in my mouth and so it was during this time that i was also trying to contact him and so uh he wasnt responding and anyway i finally called him and he he gave me this long sob story about that he had health problems in this well we all have health problems in fact all of us end up having health problems all of us end up dying okay so i dont like it when people give me crazy stupid excuses like that or im too busy or im too tired or my health i dont want to hear that i caught i called my other i emailed my other uh student and i said did you ever make any contact with rich because hes really been giving me the runaround and she goes oh yeah he contacted me right away and that mentioned there was a couple of different mutes i could order and like well whats going on here after a couple of weeks um i sent an email to rich now this is gone this is about a month after this is in i said hey you know you know i was trying to make some modifications with my cg benge trumpet i said you were going to send me some lead pipes but here it is coming up on a month later i never got anything from you he with a kind of a sharp and angry tone he goes weve been busy and it goes i told you i had health problems and im like well okay you have health problems yet i think youve been helping out some of my students he didnt say anything and i said well so whats the deal on this um the lead pipe or you cant send them out to me he goes yes but im not sure we have those in stock he goes were going to send them out and if we dont send them out were going to give you a call now i mentioned before in a in a blog that rich idas bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired hes not very happy person hes not a very friendly person and uh glib is that a definition or or adjective describe him i dont know if i would say glib glum there we go glum uh deadpan flat these are all words i would describe his delivery yeah thats it thats it right there hes i wouldnt say sarcastic hes just deadpan and flat anyway uh i never got a call from him he really dropped the ball in fact when i added it all up i thought wait a minute if hes doing this with somebody at my level somebody with a huge media following and i dont think most of you understand that my most of my media following is not at youtube where i do have almost subscribers but i do have tens of thousands of people on my email roster collected over the years thousands and thousands at facebook thousands and thousands tens of thousands really it comes close to a hundred thousand so i dont really think he understood the ramifications or the impact that his intransigent and incompetence would actually have he will shortly this is my review kurt thompsons review trumpet sizzles review of the horrible interaction i had with rich ita when i look back at it now i regret not being more i guess frank more donald trump like with some of my students just than just telling them hey i had a pretty bad experience with the guy cost me a lot of money i ended up holding an empty bag and you probably shouldnt um use this guy i mean i probably should have been more donald trump like with this individual um talking about him but i did i just thought i would give him the benefit of the doubt but after this last time that really was a nail in the coffin it really was a nail on the cough and number two you have time to kill and youre listening also to the sound of my voice number three you dont have a lot of money to burn burn or throw on the toilet and thats also why i made this nice and long and detailed and so after getting done with this you can make your own choice about rich ita and his brass instrument workshop my opinion is you take away the pilczuck product and no ones ever heard of rich ita okay you take away that pilczuck lead pipe deal and whos rich ita no ones ever heard of him he doesnt have any good reviews hes just a big zero on nothing and thats the repair technician forget about the player we all know that theres no player aspect really to this guy at all are there other brass instrument workshops in the us that you could send your item to there are are there other trumpet repair people that you could visit that might actually be friendly and do what you want them to do there are so thats why im making this review there are other options out there there are other people out there there are other shops out there that likely could do what you need to have done without crawling through broken glass with rich ita and his brass instrument workshop you know the the whole vibe and feeling i got working with rich is that he was doing me a favor that i was way down at the bottom of the totem pole and he was way up at the top and he was doing me a favor in reality in the real world is actually the reverse of that as a repair person you are not high up on the ladder when it comes to the music world you are not the recap of my review with rich ita and his brass instrument workshop for trumpet repair trombone repair and other repairs cornet repair and custom work is i do not recommend you using rich ita and his services and i think you could go elsewhere and do better you,0.0
how the critical drinker misrepresents barbie and why that matters,alternate title brewski beer overdose and its consequences help support my work,is bobby garbage garbage if you will was it sold to audiences under false pretenses and if so is there a danger here according to a recent video from everyones favorite youtuber the critical drinker the answer to those questions is an emphatic yes the truth though isnt quite so simple and in fact that video says a good deal more about the drinker and his critical practice than you might have thought join me as we wade through a truly baffling review and investigate the way the drinker continues to mislead his audience the way contentious narratives are invoked to disguise poor criticism and the way this video illuminates the fundamental dilemma at the heart of the critical drinkers channel lets get into it the drinkers video starts and ends with the accusation that warner deliberately misled the public as to the character of their film you guys really pulled off a miracle with this one successfully duping all of us including me into believing that barbie was going to be just another colorful lighthearted easygoing family comedy uh this is from the trailer by the way you guys everything about dying anyway the drinker really hits this idea hard hammering at home near the end in a way he doesnt often tend to do barbie really is a wolf in sheeps clothing tricking people into watching it by promising one thing and delivering something very different and i guess thats the thing that really struck me about this film a lot of parents will have been duped into taking their daughters along to watch this movie probably expecting the kind of breezy colorful familyfriendly movie that was advertised only to find them so the nearest thing the drinkers video has to a thesis or a through line the string from which his usual motley assortment of nitpicks hang is this idea that warner pulled a fast one tricked families into the cinema before blasting them with an agendadriven misandrist adult film so before we dig into the significance of the drinker taking this angle lets just check is he right sorry i dont know how that sound file got in the mix is he right well no lets talk about the trailers i cant play them whole copyrights of beach but hey to make sure im not misrepresenting them in my discussion the one teaser and two trailers warner dropped for this bad boy that formed the backbone of the films prerelease pr are linked in the description so give them a watch now if you fancy the initial teaser the only real look at this film the world was given until like three months back was well its the space odyssey referencing opening sequence played i think in full because you know what kids love you know what those little guys just go nuts for youre not against them hyped about going to the pictures stanley kubrick references those little bastards eat that up but jolly thats not the whole teaser well no of course not theres also a five second montage of random clips closing it out so you know at this point is barbie setting itself up as a lightweight kids flick or is it maybe signaling itll be a more thoughtful and adult affair youll have to decide that one i guess and those random clips focus on the cast show of margot robbie ryan gosling see mu liu and plenty more emphasis on celebrity on a sort of star power adults care about was a staple tactic maybe the staple tactic of the films publicity but maybe im wrong maybe that doesnt sink this guys thesis maybe the only thing kids love more than a kubrick reference is recognizing their favorite snl alumni yeah anyway the rest of these trailers gesture toward a similar direction i think thats fair to say i mean you might look at the trailers and see the sex jokes and the s folk song sing along you might see a project driven more by star power than by its somewhat parse ip you might see barbie say shes been thinking about death you might see a film the premise of which isnt lighthearted easygoing barbie fun time yay but is instead very clearly a complication or subversion of the lighthearted easygoing barbie fun time yay you might expect when hearing the phrase barbie movie a film that looks to be family friendly sure but not necessarily family oriented not a kids film but a film kids can enjoy alongside their parents you might look to the trailers and see all that or you might not see it the drinker certainly didnt or at least he claims not to have but on balance im going to say yes that big idea he opens with is pretty clearly a misrepresentation of the films pr and i dont anticipate a lot of pushback on that if thats granted then yeah bro looks like a clown but more importantly great news we can proceed with the video and get on our way toward the conclusion that payoff is going to be a doozy but heres the thing the quality of and intentions behind the rest of the drinkers review also play a role in that conclusion so really sorry i know you guys hate it when i go through a drinker video and pluck it apart but it looks like weve got to do at least a little of this one bit i really like is here where all the important jobs are done by the barbies and the kens just kind of exist theyve got no inherent value they contribute nothing they have no power or say in how their society is run and theyre basically looked down on as a bit silly and irrelevant by the barbies oh my goodness what could the writers possibly be trying to tell us about their views on men music what we see here is the drinker brushing right up against meaningful criticism and then blowing right past it ill expound lets put our thinking caps on in a film about femininity and about female existence under patriarchy this idea the film plays with now and then the kenza eye candy are peripheral but they dont get an equal slice of the pie what could this mean could it be a tongueincheek inversion of our familiar gender politic could the point here be a sort of defamiliarization of the role women are often still forced into flipping those traits eye candy peripheral subordinate back onto male characters in order to highlight how and why societys voicing of these upon anyone is a problem or could the fact that regardless of context men are on the bottom rung of the ladder are subservient simply mean film thinks men bad the creators of hate men and thats that the drinker hitches his heart to the latter option and thats both kinda funny and a huge missed opportunity to actually see something halfway insightful see some speaking the way barbie land works is twofold the subordination of the kens shows the drawbacks of our currently existing gender imbalances while the barbies successes show the heights women could achieve worthys imbalance is not a factor yes there is an inequality here but its one being used to make a point about equality and crucially something the drinker seems to miss later on as well barbie land is not the films recommendation its not a blueprint for gender utopia it isnt reality it can never be and it was never supposed to be even in universe it was explicitly created for a purpose that purpose being the inspiration of girls to show them what they could do and be personally that is the idea here but while that concept is a little messy given the kens barbies and allens alike are seemingly endowed with some degree of sapience or at least the potential for it barbie lands limited opportunities for kens is a bit troubling the film kinda hangs a lantern on this with the closing voiceover but lampshading an issue isnt the same same as resolving that issue so yes this would i think be grounds for a valid critique of if not the films ideas then at least the way those ideas are delivered but you see the issue right to get to this knot you have to actually think about the film about the things that make you uneasy about why they make you uneasy before you hit record and honestly im probably giving the guy too much credit by assuming any of that even registered with him that he didnt just woke spot the surface level dynamic of man being dominated by women and call it a day after all a broken clock is right twice a day and by that same logic if you let a half cut full rant for a couple of years about dozens of films statistically he is gonna bump into some real problems eventually that doesnt mean hell actually critique them it doesnt even mean hes able to just the yeah hell end up mouthing off in their general vicinity before going on to shout at more clouds moving on this criticism is also a bit odd like one guy literally walks up to barbie and slaps her in the ass and in the middle of a crowded boardwalk in broad daylight in front of her boyfriends go with me here the real world in this film isnt all that real anyone whos seen the film will recall that things are often a little exaggerated well do mattel executives regularly engage in high octane car chases maybe thats an america thing viewers from la please do tell me the last time you saw enon crates gunning it down pacific avenue given this it seems strange that this moment gets targeted by the realism police and something like the mattel chase doesnt when public sexual assault is the thing that you know actually happens sometimes but of course the idea of an otherwise realistic world contorting itself to overstate the frequency of assault by evil men supports the spiteful hatred of men line the drink is pursuing and by extension the corruptive leftist propaganda problem it implies more than a recognition of this worlds wider exaggerated realism would so that recognition isnt given because withholding it allows this narrative to continue forming and this kind of thing makes up the body of the drinkers video rapid fire nitpicks that come and go just quick enough to hide the fact that most dont really work for instance he notes barbies change depending on how their owners play with them and then goes on to criticize this concept by listing things which are not their owners playing with them do you have any idea how many barbie dolls must get broken or thrown in trash compactors or set on fire or eaten by family pets every single day or take this reading the drinker offers so youre a woman who wants to be a mother or a homemaker screw you fascists if youre thinking hang on what about america ferraras character arguably the real heart of this film what about the way she very clearly draws her strength the strength that saves barbie and barbie land from motherhood what about that already iconic line near the films clothes we mothers stand still so that our daughters can look back and see how far theyve come the way that sentiment and the film more widely celebrates the motherdaughter bond if youre thinking about any of those things um stop thinking about them i guess if thats not enough how about the way drinker acts confused by the barbies quick subjugation question how the supposedly intelligent empowered and selfconfident barbies were so easily subjugated by ken and the others this is the kind of awkward little despite there being a line in the film which directly answers that question maybe he didnt like the explanation though and elected to ignore it you know like an intelligent person would and shockingly some of these nitpicks are just outright untrue the real world and all the men in it are shown to be universally irredeemably horrible because of course they are what about duolingo husband that hes just like me for real king what about him did i blink during a split second shot of him kicking a dog or something turns out if you accuse any of these guys of lying when they demonstrably are a bunch of their buddies sick their goons on you so at the risk of that happening again gee im noticing a trend look im not going to mince my words this is bad criticism i dont just mean its based on misleading or untrue observations its also just bad criticism actively hostile to complex thought barbie land privileges barbies wow i guess that means the film wants us to oppress men new gender roles are adopted and abandoned quickly by both kens and barbies following their exposure to la business patriarchy isnt that an awkward little paradox wait wait whats that youre saying its intentional to point out the way gender is learned and the way patriarchy can seem attractive even to the women and men at harms uh sorry mate dont care those words are too big the review portion of his video finishes with a hamfisted attempt to apply the gender politic of barbieland to our reality and then to criticize the result despite again that not being the point of barbie land but this hostility to just thinking is made most apparent about midway through the drinkers video barbie eventually finds the kid who plays with her who turns out to be an communist activist feminist but i think the movie wants us to empathize with but me for the life of me i could not tell you why let me help you out surprisingly no were not really supposed to empathize with the girl who calls barbie a fascist and makes her cry maybe the girl does raise a kind of valid point or two but she does so in a really mean way and thats bad were not supposed to be on her side yet because theres this cool thing called an arc she gets over the course of the film by reconnecting with her mother she begins to see the worth in barbie and the value of aspirational figures just as barbie sees that the kid has a point that aspirational symbols arent solutions in themselves yada yada yada were supposed to like where she ends up not where she starts which is honestly a kind of meanspirited caricature of zuma leftism but in a supremely telling moment the drinker seems to have spotted that caricature filtered it through the hollywood is leftist and evil pipe hes got in his brain and landed on the idea that were supposed to like and agree with everything nasty the girl says simply because its couched in a woke aesthetic thats slippage is amusing and illustrates how thoughtless how kneejerk this critique is woke means were supposed to like it and its unlikable so film bad there is no selfawareness here again this is bad criticism this is all bad criticism but it doesnt matter the opening of the drinkers video lays out that misrepresentation of the films pr but it does something else too it very consciously and very jarringly inserts barbie into the canon of hated woke objects barbie is like the deformed mutated rage child of captain marvel ghostbusters and shehulk so im an expert at controlling my anger because i do it i dont remember asking you a goddamn thing it seems a very transparent move serving to designate barbie as a battleground in the war against wokeness and to turn his video from a simple barbie review into another installment in that war if this is the case the result of this scaling up is that this abstract narrative of wokeness supersedes the specific film ostensibly under review and the specifics of that film to the legions of drinker viewers who are slurping the reactionary koolaid the quality of his review the validity of his objections all this becomes relatively unimportant because the battle is already won the film is already designated as woke and woke is already bad it doesnt matter if he lies about the film it doesnt matter if he thinks about the film it it doesnt matter if they think about the film because it isnt about whether or not the men are bad about whether or not this detail or that is explained or whether or not were supposed to sympathize with the mean lefty girl the narrative matters the shoddy criticism that makes up the rest of a video like this only needs to sound convincing to scan once in order to legitimize that narrative and its subsumption of the work under review the result of this tendency writ large is a culture in which movies arent worthwhile for their ideas their performances or how theyre able to affect their viewers theyre worthwhile only insofar as they can be converted into clicks and into rhetoric and lets return to that rhetoric shall we what an inspiring message for impressionable young girls the thing is none of this would have been quite so insidious if the marketing hadnt done everything in its power to keep it a secret were told that warner and mattel have tricked families into seeing their film and that this is a problem this is quote insidious not simply misleading the language used suggests its not just a question of whether little timmy and brenda are going to have a good time the drinker recommends you dont bring your kids here and that youll thank him for that later its not very often that i say this in my reviews but if youre a parent and youre thinking about taking your kids along to see barbie then the drinker recommends you skip this one and do literally anything else with them believe me youll thank me later the implication being that bringing them would risk interpolating those kids into this dangerous leftist mindset the eagleeyed or rabbit eared i guess among you might recognize how similar this sounds to that groomer narrative thats been doing the rounds over there in normal country for a while now and to the related strands of antiwokanee cultural marxism theories the drinkers podcast buddies like the bandy about but hey lets be generous and allow for the possibility that this similarity is accidental that this altright substrate is a result of oversight on the drinkers part instead of malice or fervor either way the video ends with a recommitment to barbie as wokeness narrative fodder and to the idea that its succeeding because the films advertising campaign lied thats interesting for a while now as more and more people have caught onto the reactionary grift the barbie question has loomed weve known for a while that the film would be a financial success so the difficulty it posed to your judds and your grifters the get woke go broke crowd was clear wokeness in this sense is an intentionally vague and malleable label as ive discussed in previous videos but theres really no workable formulation of it that wouldnt include the barbie film how then is that sacred mantra to be preserved how can barbies runaway success be anything but an open refutation of get woke go broke the drinker knowingly or not though i suspect knowingly has furnished this movement with an answer barbie tricked the world people were lured to see it under false pretenses it doesnt count as a counter example because the trailers lied as weve seen that isnt really true but when is truth ever got in the way of this slot before the drinkers barbie video then might be more than a loose collection of inaccurate jobs it might be an effective employment of dishonesty a carefully calculated almost plausible justification for the continuation of that antiwork drift his fans so rapidly claim hes not a part of to be clear though i am not stating that this is the case it is a possibility short but there is another one and thats that the drinker isnt pushing these narratives intentionally isnt pursuing an inaccurate framing of the film in order to help the reactionary antiwork grift continue and isnt trying to couch his inaccurate review in this sort of mott and bailey structure where flaws and poor criticism dont matter because woke film bad anyway the other possibility is that hes not ideologically committed to any of this and is simply exploiting it exploiting an audience that doesnt care if your reviews built on lies misrepresentations and nonsensical nitpicks so long as its targeting a woke product and that hes doing this either out of laziness or because hes not a good enough critic to do his job any other way you know turning out formulaic thriller novels and clickable little morsels of hate is one thing but actually engaging with art is another so his barbie video isnt interesting because its full of porkies or because it sometimes plays like he fell asleep in the theater its interesting because it lays out pretty clearly the dilemma at the heart of the critical drinker channel is he just a child on the antiwork rift thats been able to maintain a kind of plausible deniability in the way id say geeks and gamers hasnt or is he just a hack unable or unwilling to produce wellwritten videos whos found a strategy that requires neither whats the answer well heres mine does it matter does it change anything either way a get woke go broke barbie exemption has been furnished either way the criticism on display here is largely drivable and either way were probably all better off not watching oh and just for all times sake they were still filled with rage and hatred and bitterness that it just had to come spewing out onto the screen oh thank you for watching if you want to help this reach a wider audience likes comments and shares are all very much appreciated if youd like to help support me more directly patreon pledges of any level are a huge help and just because on the rare occasions i put out videos like this i always get a bunch of comments along the lines of wow stop cloud chasing make your own videos dont just drama farm bigger names just just look at my channel man ive got more than videos and this is the third about this guy the vast majority of my content is about media not about people misreading that media so if you comment something like that ill know you havent actually watched to the end and ill therefore instantly disregard your opinion if you want to hear me talk more barbie less drinker then hey check out the last video i posted otherwise cheers bye and special thanks as always to my

galatians a critical review part,this is the fourth th part of rabbi griffins critical review of galatians galatians is the foundation of the false gospel taught by,bokartov good morning welcome to yet another very special alias were talking today the critical review of galatians this is the fourth session maybe the final session well see how that pans out but uh glad youre here please be sure and subscribe to our channel be sure and like our video and uh be sure and comment let us know your thoughts and so forth people do that all the time sometimes we have some lively discussions and so forth and thats great so glad youre here so welcome i know that this this teaching on galatians for some people has been well its kind of its mixed results uh i think that the majority as ive been receiving some feedback the majority feel liberated um you know its psychologically and spiritually liberating to to be able to face i guess reality about paul in general and of course galatians specifically and just be able to accept it for what it is and walk away from it we talked about yesterday that uh uh you know were not necessarily like i dont have this uh morbid you know disgust i guess or hatred for paul or whatever hes just wrong like like a bunch of other theologians in life you know theres theres people that even in our modern age who are you know preaching a false gospel um theyre good people you know theyre theyre people that uh i wouldnt mind hanging out with as far as you know that goes but i can i can at the same time completely dismiss what theyre teaching as is absolutely false and and and hope that someday that uh you know theyll um come to the reality or whatever of truth thats okay we dont have to we dont have to um be shy about that but i understand peoples mentalities i some people who have reached out to me uh have wanted to educate me on on what paul is actually teaching and showing they want to show me how he lines up with the tanakh and i appreciate that i understand the heart there you know you you want to uh i guess in a way save me maybe or or something um but but you know i just wanted to say with respect to that that ive been ive been doing this for nearly three decades um and i i doubt very seriously im im always open but i have uh it is there is a plus percent likelihood that whatever youre going to tell me with respect to uh you know that topic i have likely either already heard or probably taught on at some point so im just saying that im not approaching this uh from a blind standpoint uh ive uh you know read a wonderful long probably pager article yesterday in the uh jewish encyclopedia very very scholarly uh extraordinarily well cited uh from from actual historians and i think this is another thing from vetted historians vetted scholars on this topic and basically they all come to the same conclusion that weve been talking about on this program uh you know its kind of like the thing that you know uh you have to believe the science uh a a mosquito carries a virus think about how small a mosquito is and yet a mosquito carries a virus you know and they uh through their little i dont i dont know what the the scientific word is but through their little snout or whatever they can inject you with a virus which means the virus is smaller than that little microscopic needle type you know part of their body in which they bite you with and yet at the same time people thought that a mask somehow would keep a virus out of their body um you know it thats its that type of cognitive dissonance and denialism that um we have to avoid in our life you know you have to follow reality uh in the description of this video actually discussed this i actually put some definitions of cognitive dissonance and denialism in this video because a lot of the a lot of the issues with paul as i talked about yesterday with people having this obsession with wanting to make him work why who cares lets just take him at face value um hes taught what he taught what he taught was wrong lets move on we dont have to make him work we dont have to take the the square peg and hammer it into the round hole and and we dont have to spend no theres plenty of people and i understand this too and i and im not exactly against it necessarily i mean you do what you want but there are some people who want to take his big bowl of spaghetti his confused spaghetti and and they want to take each little strand out and and try to make it put back in the box and and you know i think its a futile attempt if you if you ive tried it i think its futile uh but more importantly whether whether whether its futile or not really heres my question just the way i think why are we spending why are we wasting our time now the reason im spending time doing this this week is because its all about trying to help people you know get set free from the confusion because as i talked about that everything works with this topic of observing the torah and it all fits together it the words of yeshua fit together with it its all perfectly great until we get to paul and then everything flies off the reason today the reason today the reason to theres only one reason today i want to i want to say this emphatically there is only one reason today and only one that people dont keep the sabbath dont eat kosher dont follow the law of moses like yeshua did like all the heroes of the bible did everybody you love and respect in the bible every single one was a tor observant believer theres only one reason today that people dont do that who believe in the messiah and its paul thats the reason that is a fact jack its all pauls fault now we could sit here and try to figure out what paul was really saying and why he said it and how its hes been misunderstood and i get it i get it i get it i get it i get it and it doesnt change what i just said and the question becomes why why do we want to do that why for what purpose why do we need to make paul make sense thats a question you have to ask yourself i have my answers i think i put them in the description of this video but you know im not a psychiatrist but i i am an intelligent human being with rational thought and uh i think that you know we could probably figure that out for our own selves now one of the other things thats brought up by the way today in this video by the way were about to jump right into it but i do want to say this one thing were about to jump into daniel lancasters comments on in his book and talk about the utter ridiculousness of them uh nothing against lancaster im sure hes a good guy but i think he falls under the same thing were trying to make the square peg were trying to hammer it with a with a big old hammer and pound it into the round oh it doesnt work so one of the things thats often cited its been cited in comments during this series i think both on the chat and also um you know on comments after um people have said repeatedly and this is not just during this series but through the years that peter kefa affirmed that paul was a a dear brother and b you know his words were holy scripture and that his words were difficult to understand etc et cetera that comes from second peter and people have used that as an alleged proof text um to prove that paul was legitimate and some more than some to prove that pauls words are the word of the living god the letters he wrote when he was you know writing letters in response to questions he had received he put a postage stamp on i gave it to the pony express and it was sent off that that letter that he wrote is the letter of the living god which of course is absurd when i say that you immediately think that kind of sounds dumb as it should because it is um but heres the problem how many of youve ever heard i know its its its really really obscure and few people that know this but how many of you have ever heard the word of god suggest that we need two witnesses to establish a thing anybody yeah so one witness would be what irrelevant so if we have a a and by the way the passage in peter in its original language is rather obscure when you read that and you think you know what does it mean it seems kind of forced too doesnt it seems kind of like weird like paul or excuse me peters talking about some stuff and all of a sudden he just kind of blurts out by the way our beloved brother paul what does that say actually so dear friends since youre looking forward to this make every effort to be found spotless blameless at peace with with him bear in mind that our lords patience mean salvation just as our dear brother paul also wrote with with the wisdom that god gave him he writes the same way and all his letters speaking in them of these matters his letters contain some things that are hard to understand which ignorant and substable people distort as they do the other scriptures by the word by the way the word scriptures there doesnt necessarily mean scriptures but thats really beside the point to their own destruction it seems kind of a strange kind of a forced entry well anyway not to belabor this too much but i got to thinking about that and i have to admit to you i i came across something that um somebody had had actually somebody had made a comment about this is why it led me to this thought and i found something that not does not at all surprise me but it surprises me in the sense that id never even thought about it because frankly um none of the letters of the new testament are scripture that became painfully obvious to me a long time ago so you know therefore i spend my time with respect to theology actually focusing on the word of god but it is so interesting to me in this conversation that this one passage i just read is the that is the battle ax thats the sword thats the spear that everybody uses to validate paul even people who are tour observant isnt it true yes it is did you know that virtually i say virtually because i you know there may be one or two or three out there but virtually every vetted scholar who has ever studied the the letters of the socalled new testament going all the way back to the third century church father origin every single one believe that second peter is a forgery did you know that every single one and some of the scholars whove written about this actually cite this seemingly forced description of pauls writings as one of the very many and varied reasons why its a forgery because it seems as if that in the third century or maybe slightly before maybe in the second century that there were people out there who were trying to push this idea that pauls writings were the word of god for obvious reasons even origin who is considered one of the preeminent early church followers and christian scholars even origin said its a fake and it as a result when the gentile roman church made their christian bible known as the new testament second peter um almost didnt make it in because pretty much everybody agreed that it was a fake so here is a huge problem and because the people who listen to this program are very very smart smarter than the average baron im not just saying that its true youve already youre already like what yeah so the one place that seems to validate paul in any way and people say oh you know rabbi his his words are just difficult to understand by the way people say you know paul was a a scholar of genius he was he was a legal genius he was a torah genius he was a uh the best of the best of the hebrews how do we know that how do we know that oh because paul told us did you know that did you know there is zero proof of that in fact i was in that article i was reading yesterday which was so good i reposted on my blog which will be out soon thank god scholars point out that his actual in the actual empirical evidence of what he says and what he writes and how he quote scriptures would would prove that he was not a preeminent torah scholar but was rather a typical hellenistic filo jewish person by no means as masoretic texts you know taurus schooled and some even doubt that he was actually under the tutelage of gamliel based on the what he says and how he says it im just telling you dont get mad at me dont start throwing darts at me im just telling you what scholars you know scholars and not just one or two but all of them talk about but again how do we know you say wait no rabbi you dont understand you dont understand rabbi he was a he was a genius he was he was a he was the best of the best he was he was just he was this brainiac he was the hebrew of hebrews the the pharisee of pharisees how do you know that well because its written where is it written and who wrote it oh it was paul who wrote it im just saying is this too much im serious is this is just have i have i lost you see what im saying um i know that what im what ive been saying here all week i know for some is for some its youre youre going through like a detox youre just what i get it i i really do and i mean that with my whole heart i understand i understand understand thats why when people write me and they say rabbi you just dont understand let me help you i just you know i understand where that comes from i really do and its not that im not teachable trust me i am a very teachable person very music um but not on stuff like this but i do i get it some of you are liberated some of you are like oh gosh oh man i was like oh i feel like i can breathe for the first time i dont have to drag a man across the finish line i can let him go and just follow god and and be like the messiah yes isnt that liberating i dont have to sit here and make this mans writings make sense god please thank you i could just move on yes you can now lets look at talk about confused writings lets look at the the book that is titled the holy epistle to the galatians thats your first clue that this is not going to be good these are sermons on a messianic jewish perspective of galatians written by d thomas lancaster published in what or something like that i bought this book way back then ive had this book all this time since was it or whenever i bought it i bought it when it first came out because back then i had the same problem i had the same cognitive dissonance denialism problem that everybody else has because i had been through i i came up through the church um i had been through decades of mental conditioning that paul was a super apostle that his work writings were the word of god that he was the most brilliant scholar known to man um in in judaism and that um and by the way when you read other rabbis which ive read you can imagine a lot um in the talmud midrash vermont and you just name it i could go i could spend minutes going through the list did you know that their writings are never not even remotely as confusing as pauls yes ladies and gentlemen you heard it first thats true when you read actual rabbinic writings they make sense isnt that strange they follow a logical train of thought and it makes sense when you read paul youre like what did he just say im ive read verses i went i was all over the map in verses that doesnt happen when you read actual rabbis i dont ever walk away from the talmud going i just dont understand oh god what they just said was like three different things you dont it doesnt happen okay so anyway um i had the same cognitive dissonance and denialism that many people experience so i i bought this because im like i got i have to make galatians make sense i have to i have to i have to but then my doctor helped me and i got better um im kidding but seriously i read this book and i was like what because the way that dan daniel lancaster he says its well whatever the reason the way that he writes this is that he explains that this is what paul is teaching and he explains it as if its great like this this makes it make sense the way i read it is are you kidding me right now if this is actually what he was teaching the guy is a fruit loop but whats remarkable to me is that the way that lancaster rides it its like yeah this is what he taught and this helps us make sense of what hes writing and so yeah its great so let me just start reading a couple of excerpts um so that you can understand the madness or at least maybe you can hear the words that im trying to say so let me see here where shall i begin ah heres the first major problem that i noted im just going to read a little excerpts mark and i get into the whole thing because were on time this is what it says says paul went as an apostle sent out to the diaspora but he did not go as one sent by the sanhedrin or even by the other apostles the risen messiah himself whom paul had encountered in a series of mystical visions sent him we talked about this yesterday paul admits it and his writings to the galatians we talked about the incredible red flag that that represents the incredible red flag and i want you to think about it because the the messiah you know hes higher right the messiah set kefa apart as the leader and then zac and ugal and i were talking yesterday about how his brother yaakov became the leader and then zaken has some other things he was reading about subsequent leaders or whatever but the messiah set cave apart as the leader and then you have the other and even even when they replaced judas they selected somebody who had been with them the entire time why was that important evidently it was when they selected when they cast lots to fill judahs place they chose somebody who would had been with them the entire time the messiah was teaching in the flesh but now yeshua has to go outside of all of that and choose somebody who was never part of that equation and raise him up to have a different gospel does that even sound remotely rational of course it doesnt in fact if that happened in our time if you and i were part of the community and there was kefa and yaakov and the boys and some guy showed up and just started teaching gospel i had never consulted with them you and i would undoubtedly be like hes a flake of course we would as we should it makes perfect sense to do that now lancaster brings something else out here he says um lets see he says pauls gospel paul explained that he received the gospel through a revelation of yeshua the messiah again i dont want to belabor this point but let me belabor the point how many of you love it when people say i didnt have any man teach me ive consulted no man god himself gave me this message how many of you when you hear that you get all warm and fuzzy and go oh thats awesome no you dont you start looking around and wondering who wheres the koolaid and whats in it of course you do because thats just idiocy so it says here he claimed that the gospel message he preached to the galatians was not mans gospel what does that even mean not mans gospel is he implying that the apostles gospel is mans gospel well since he didnt consult them it kind of insinuates that doesnt it so it says it was not the normal gospel message this is daniel lancaster writing this are you listening to this let me just start over im just gonna read the whole thing because i keep interrupting myself because i get too excited but let me read the whole thing and then let your intelligence work through it let me start over paul experienced and he received the gospel through a revelation of the yeshua the messiah he claimed that the gospel message he preached to the galatians was not mans gospel it was not the normal gospel he received a different gospel this is an important point a critical point for understanding paul the message of the gospel that paul proclaimed was not precisely the same message of the gospel that the rest of the apostolic community proclaimed in other places paul specifically refers to his unique gospel message as my gospel um am i the only one who like about red flags just went up when i read that his was a different gospel it wasnt the normal gospel message and see lancaster again you would think that lancaster is writing this and hes hes later going to say how this is just nuts but he doesnt his conclusion is yeah so yeah thats why uh it makes sense now thats how we can reconcile it because its a different gospel and so yeah and he had you know thats cool in what im not im not making it up dont buy the boat dont waste your money but you know if you want to verify what im saying fine but otherwise you know take my word for it it says this should be troubling to us what makes paul gospel his gospel how is this gospel that he received by special revelation different from what he calls mans gospel how is his gospel message different from the rest of the apostolic community well he says pauls gospel differs because paul taught that salvation in messiah is efficient for both jews and gentiles the other apostles also included gentiles but they listen to this but they expected that once a gentile received the good news about the king of the jews he would become a jew after all its not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs matthew now listen to this what daniel lancaster just wrote is the laped message which he just said according to his opinion as a hes a messianic pastor or whatever that the gospel that said that once the gentiles come in you know what hes saying here is the of the other apostles also included gentiles okay yeah youre gentile come to synagogue listen do you accept the messiah do you want to live a torah life like he did like everybody else in the bible did yes great so become a jew like us just like abraham did actually it was abrahams gospel abraham and sarah went around trying to make gentiles jews just like he had become he was the protoevangelist so what what lancaster is saying is that was that was the gospel of the apostles which happens to be the gospel that lapid judaism teaches but pauls gospel taught that a jew should be a jew but not really wink wink not nod were going to make sure you stop being jewish too just saying and that gentiles dont have to follow the law which the one new man will become a now guys if we take that for what its worth and by the way i think hes right about that then that means the gospel that we teach at lepid judaism is the gospel of kaifa yaakov and the other thats good news no pun intended so it says here paul just it says paul disagreed with this gospel though hes right other it says jewish believers taught that gentiles who embrace messiah would should and eventually must convert and become jewish thats because its not thats a natural rational logical progression and i know its crazy but it follows the pattern of that was given to us in the bible on many many many many many many different examples but god gives us patterns so that we would know what to look for so that we would look for something else according to paul so paul disagreed his gospel was not just good news for israel but for all humanity heres the good news you dont have to follow the law of moses because its a burden its a buzz kill i personally hate it and therefore you dont have to follow it thats fantastic this is what made paul so radical and put him outside the jerusalem circle by the way scholars agree with lancaster on this that that the other the the apostles had issues with paul uh he was he was not um well received for obvious reasons what what was pauls gospel he had he he writes one more time for the sake of redundancy pauls gospel taught that gentiles can inherit eternal life the kingdom of heaven the resurrection of the dead standing among the people of god without becoming a jew which was he writes a radical idea not only is it a radical idea its also a wrong idea and it doesnt follow any biblical pattern it doesnt follow which is also an example and it doesnt comport with any any zero zero scriptures from the actual word of god zero nor doesnt comport this matters to me may not matter to others but it does not comport with any uh uh ancient jewish idea about how nonjews would eventually come into the fold which by the way contrary to see this is what people dont understand people think that rabbis didnt want gentiles thats not true at all judaism was very evangelical but everybody understood that the gentiles would eventually become jews just like abraham did just like sarah did just like rebecca did just like all the matriarchs did just like ruth did just like rahab did just like obadiah did just like jethro did right frankly just like a rabbi akiva did that this is how they would come in and so what paul is saying is actually the exact opposite the way that were going to come into the covenant is by not keeping the covenant so this is definitely pauls gospel now something else that lancaster writes here is that he brings out that in rome there was this there was this law uh uh jew anyone who was jewish um was exempt from participating in any of the pagan roman cults or pagan roman rights but you had to be a jew you couldnt be a godfearer you couldnt be you know a a member of the synagogue or whatever you had to be jewish okay otherwise if you were in rome which remember romes im not talking about the city im talking about the empire if you were in rome and part of rome you were required by law by roman law to participate in the cults of rome right also if youre not jewish you cant marry a jew so how can you be jew and gentile one and messiah but you cant get married how is that going to work in a practical reality how is that going to work so youve got all these people in the in a community in a congregation and um theres jew and gentile were all dancing around like happy little you know uh happy little beach going hippies and singing the song jew and gentile one and messiah isnt this great and then we got all these problems like a jewish boy meets jewish girl and he cant marry her excuse me jewish boy meets gentile girl my apologies and he cant marry her but theyre but theyre one in messiah but hes forbidden to marry her okay so jew and gentile won a messiah were all wearing our little togas and running around on the beach having a great time and its its time for dinner but we cant eat what youre eating how is that going to work well wait a minute its the sabbath were keeping the sabbath youre not how is that going to work these are all practical realities but lets get back to this one issue hes riding here hes talking about how roman law granted jewish people the right to practice judaism it exempted them from the from the requisite emperor worship and idolatry incumbent upon the rest of the population of the roman empire without a jewish status the god fearing gentiles were vulnerable to arrest and even prosecution for failure to participate in reading required civic and religious duties so therefore for a gentile who was believing in in the in in the messiah becoming a part of the community would mean that you know you would no longer be required to participate in this cult worship so therefore my question ladies and gentlemen is why would you try to dissuade gentiles from becoming jews at least in this practical environment you start to see the seeds of how everything got mixed together why is it that believers and messiah celebrate pagan holidays today this is why because this man came along with his his gospel and he taught gentiles dont get dont become jews just remain gentiles and its a it creates a huge mess not the least of which is if im a gentile and i believe in the messiah and i want to try to somehow follow the messiah by remaining uncircumcised then im also required to keep pagan holidays of rome which i otherwise would not be required to do if i became a jew but my teacher paul is telling me that if i become a jew then ive trampled under foot the grace of god because we all know its obvious that if god tells us to do something and were obedient to his word he will send us to everlasting hell and damnation thats obvious so being obedient to the word of god will in fact lead to punishment so therefore were not going to do that and were going to remain gentiles in christ and as a result have to go worship uh pagan deities in other words its cruel if not stupid why wouldnt you want this to happen because its an easy fix first of all these are gentiles who want to believe in the messiah and want to now follow the ways of israel thats a good thing and by the way just so happens in this day and age if they become jews they no longer have to re participate in pagan things why would you want to prevent that not forget the scriptural reality forget the fact that its absolute truth forget the fact that this is what has happened for thousands of years amongst the people who love god forget all of that what about just practical reality wouldnt it be nice if everybody who was in the community if they wanted to could marry somebody in the community wouldnt it be nice if when we all sat down for dinner there wasnt a question about whether or not youre eating pork chops or not did you put shrimp in the souffle im just asking wouldnt that be nice why do we want to create this sociological mess we all do were all jews so we dont have to go worship the caesar you do unfortunately or youre going to go to prison is this why they they threw socalled christians to the lions den in rome is that why was paul the cause of that because remember in rome if youre jewish you dont have to be a pagan youre not going to be therefore thrown to the lions is im not i dont know i dont have the answer im not suggesting im just im asking a question because it doesnt make sense its not logical whats the point what would be the point of having two classes of people in the same community and not to mention the fact that yeshua said the exact opposite theres going to be one flock and one shepherd well having two groups of people having jew and gentile ladies gentlemen is not one flock thats two flocks yitra ruth the matriarchs obadiah the the pharaohs daughter asanath the wife of of joseph rahab all the members of the mixed multitude came out of out of egypt all of them every single one became converts of judaism but now god has changed his mind entirely he showed us that example so that when the messiah came we wouldnt follow it he sent sarah and and abraham out on a daily basis to win people to judaism to bring them in and get them circumcised only so that when messiah came we would look at abraham and sarahs example and not follow it so basically everything that abraham and sarah did as evangelists was basically for nothing they were bringing in people and getting them circumcised and bringing into the covenant only to find out later that the messiah wants him to do the exact opposite of that its nuts why did abraham get circumcised if the messiah doesnt want us to get circumcised why is there even circumcision why did the messiah get circumcised sin equals breaking the law so therefore the message is to break the law none of it makes sense torah equals covenant thats why its called the ark of the covenant but yet in order to enter the covenant we have to not enter the covenant thats how we enter the covenant by not entering it follow me a jew as i follow the messiah although i were not following the messiah and i dont actually want you to follow me so follow me i know thats from a forged letter but still follow me as i follow messiah well thats contradictory because ive just told you as a gentile dont follow me because im a jew supposedly trying to follow messiah but youre not jewish or youre actually not supposed to follow me the whole idea that the jews believe that the the law of moses was somehow used for salvation and justification is actually a straw man argument it never existed its a false argument well you know the jews believe in the law that that would you could be saved by works but now we have salvation by grace thats never been true that is something that was made up by a hellenistic jew named paul because thats how he believed but thats not what the jews taught none of this makes sense pauls gospel makes judaism a blood cult which has never been a blood cult blood cult meaning that you cant be a part of faith unless youre born into it its never been that way not in as its been understood grafted in okay you cant graft in if you can graft fruit onto a fruit tree but you cant graft other stuff to be grafted in you need the same fruit its absurd all of this absurd i and and people that are listening to me today as i said earlier i understand the shock i understand being dismayed i understand the proverbial bubble being being busted a couple more quotes here were almost were over our time but were just gonna just a couple more things paul taught that gentiles do not need to become jews in order to be reckoned as part of the people of god whats the problem with that statement the problem with that statement is that jews are the people of god obviously paul himself made a clear line of distinction between jews and gentile believers paul did in his work in his worldview its his and his alone jewish believers are obligated to the covenant responsibilities incumbent upon them why because were in the covenant were obligated to it because were in it gentiles are also obligated to gods torah but not to those particular aspects of it which define a person as jewish such as circumcision thats stupid because none of this the torah is not about identity its about who we are as covenantal people but its not about identity we dont get circumcised just to say oh look im jewish because by the way by the way can you tell if somebodys circumcised or not im just asking use common sense walking around town do you look around the room and go oh look that guy over there he circumcised hes obviously jewish paul drew that that line of the division and division is right paul drew that line of division and all his writings especially in galatians where he makes it sound like you dont have to do its just its none of this makes sense uh in the instance in the jewish encyclopedia it talks about pauls gospel and says you know he he made the gospel accessible to all men at at the cost of sound reason and logic paul taught um it says the thought of people of gentiles celebrating sabbatical years and the sabbath and other festivals and so on seem to distress and this is daniel lancaster seemed to distress him he wondered if he had labored in vain for the gentiles of galatia he did not understand why they wanted to turn back to the weak and worthless and elementary principles of the world and become enslaved by them again according to the plain meeting here what hes trying to say is according to pauls plain meaning the elementary things of the world is the law of moses and i understand where someone say no hes not talking about that i get it i thought that very thing but again were looking at the pashat level oh anyway im out of time i could read more and more of this stuff but i think that we its safe to i think ive pointed out enough of the lunacy for us to have enough by the way in galatians chapter where it says that paul confronted peter can i just tell you that never happened that never happened i i wanted to make at least make that one comment i know ive said this before things that never happened that never happened id shoot out paul uh peter to his face no you didnt no you didnt that that never happened i dont have time to comment on that but just know that that was thats a fantasy but anyways thank you for being here this is gonna conclude our discussion of galatians well come back tomorrow and talk about god is good all the time so that people uh will have you know uh i dont know a a respite but well do something tomorrow well talk about something i dont know what but well well have a great time tomorrow uh but i hope listen i hope this series has been helpful to those of you who are still dealing with the cognitive business and denialism and and other things i dont want to you know youre all good people you all have a great heart and i totally totally understand and empathize with you and you know just go back through this series and work through it but heres the most important thing whatever your feeling is whether you agree with me or not dont ever let the teachings of a man stall you or trip you up dont keep coming back and trying to feel like you have to reconcile you have to prove me wrong or whatever guys dont let that stop you from obeying the word of god god is god the word of god be true and the word of man be a liar okay so god bless all we look forward to seeing you tomorrow until then have a great and amazing day please subscribe to our

the state of gun violence in the us explained in charts,america doesnt have a gun problem it has several of them these charts and maps break down the scope of the problem,we need rescue inside the auditoriummultiple victims the united states has a problem with gun violence bush we hold the victims in our hearts clinton perhaps we may never fully understandit a man with a semiautomatic weapon we talk about it after mass shootings butit s much larger and more complicated than those debates allow here s what you needto know about the state of gun violence in america it s true that the us sees many more massshootings than these other developed countries between and there were massshootings in public populated places that s excluding gang violence and terrorism of course the us is a much larger countrybut if you adjust for population size it still ranks higher of these countries finland is next with just shootings over years but a much much smaller population and this type of tragedy seems to be happeningmore often in the us each of these squares represents a public mass shooting with ormore fatalities before they happened months apart on average but since thenonly months go by between them obama i hope and pray that i dont have tocome out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in thesecircumstances that was october and just about months later obama yesterday a tragedy occurred in sanbernardino our first order of business is to send our thoughts and prayers to the familiesof those whove been killed public mass shootings get all the attentionbecause they re often so indiscriminate but the truth is mass shootings are unlikemost gun deaths in america here s how it breaks down according to the most recent data peopleare killed with guns every day on average about of those are homicides of which maybe at most can be considered part of mass shootings most of those killed people a day aresuicides the rest are accidental shootings police actions and undetermined incidents those suicides they show up in internationalcomparisons too these are the countries ranked highest on human development by theun the us has the highest suicide rate among them and this darker bar shows how many ofthose are with guns some people think suicide isn t really relevantto the gun issue lott to go and think some type of gun controlregulations that are being talked about are going to stop somebody from committing suicidewhen there are so many other ways to commit suicide but the methods that people use are importantbecause suicide attempts often stem from temporary crises the vast majority of people who survivesuicide attempts don t end up dying from suicide but guns make it nearly impossibleto get that second chance the victims of gun suicides are overwhelminglymen and mostly white and the rate of gun suicides has been increasingin the us at the same time the rate of gun homicides has been decreasing especiallysince the s when crime rates in general were higher but if you compare the us to other developedcountries it doesn t look like good news these are homicides adjusted for populationsize the us would probably have a higher homicide rate even without guns but you cansee how gun violence pushes that rate far beyond the other countries here the victims of these shootings they renot the ones you often see on the national news they re disproportionately young blackmen shundra robinson you guys can leave hereand go on with your lives but we gotta go home to empty rooms because our children slives were taken away by people who should not have had guns anyway one possible explanation is that us simplyhas more crime than those other countries but if you set aside homicides for a momentand look rates of burglary or assault you don t see the same spike that you see withhomicide it s not that america has much more crimeit s that crime in the us is much more lethal altogether the number of gun deaths in theus from to exceeds the number of americans killed by aids by illegal drugoverdoses the iraq and afghanistan wars and terrorism combined it should be clear by now that this levelof gun violence is a uniquely american problem among the developed world and here s onereason why there are a ton of guns in the us this chartof shows the estimated number of guns by country it s adjusted for population size and it sstill not even close oregon shooter s father the question thati would like to ask is how on earth could he compile guns how can that happen if you take a look back at the countrieswith the highest levels of human development you can see that it s relatively reallyeasy to get a gun in the us all of the other countries require a license to purchase mostguns and those purchases are recorded into an official registry to get that licensepeople have to state a reason for why they want a gun and in most countries they haveto pass a safety test and are required by law to store their guns safely in part because of its lax laws there arewell over million guns in the us and counting this chart doesn t reflect private salesbut it shows the number of background checks which all federally licensed dealers haveto run it suggests the demand for guns has been increasing steeply since barack obamatook office so we ve looked at gun deaths and at gunownership this chart puts them together it shows that among highly developed countriesthe more guns in a country the more gun deaths you can see that countries like switzerlandwhich have relatively more guns than a country like the netherlands also have a higher gundeath rate and here s the us likewise us states with more guns have moregun homicides there are outliers like idaho which has high rates of gun ownership butlow rates of gun murders but overall there s a correlation between gun ownership and homiciderates and that relationship has held up in studies that control for things like povertyunemployment and crime the correlation between gun ownership andgun deaths is even stronger for suicides it make sense depression with a gun is moredangerous than depression without one likewise fights domestic disputes roadrage drunkenness all much more dangerous with a gun than without that said you might need different policiesto keep guns away from potential mass shooters

bipartisan group of lawmakers look for solutions on gun violence,the attack at the uvalde texas elementary school has once again raised questions about how to prevent the next tragedy,e families he spoke with thank you this latest attack has once again raised questions about how to prevent these kinds of tragedies and here in washington a bipartisan group of lawmakers met today to discuss what if any potential solutions could earn the necessary votes in the us senate carl hulse is the chief washington correspondent for the new york times he joins me from capitol hill welcome back to the newshour your piece that you wrote this morning was headlined why republicans wont budge on guns and you quoted a comment from north dakota senator kevin cramer tell us about that exchange and what he said carl senator kramer i give him credit for being forthright was engaged in a discussion and said you know i dont want to take things off the table i am going to consider things and i said what would happen to you how would your voters respond if you back in control he said they will probably throw me out of office i think that kind of sums up where a lot of republicans are on this issue unfortunately we have been here before there is a terrible horrific mass killing pressure on capitol hill to do something about it talks start about doing something about it but they dont really lead anywhere there is a little bit of optimism this evening that despite partisan group could get somewhere members say things feel different this time but it is hard to imagine in this environment in a midterm election year them finding any really significant agreement so we are just going to have to watch it congress left today the senate for about days and that can take momentum out of these talks too so a little bit of hope but not much optimism if those two things can go together judy we have heard in the past a little bit of hope after these kinds of incidents but most of the time it has faded after i do want to ask you where this opposition comes from since there are public opinion polls that show a large percentage of americans favor some kind of regulation background checks for example so where does this opposition come from carl it is an interesting thing it is overwhelmingly popular but these members here the republicans they are from conservative states people take their gun rights very seriously certainly in north dakota south dakota those states where these votes would have to come from members worry the backlash will come from those people almost a single issue voter type of situation where if they go ahead and agree with some kind of gun control that that will be it for them of course the nra it is wounded and weakened the nra by some internal scandals but it is still a force in republican politics no republican wants to be attacked by the nra of course a lot of the primaries are already done this year but that does not change the calculation a lot of republicans really think that guns gun rights just have to be unfettered and they are going to act that way it is hard to see as you said its going to take votes from republicans to break a logjam or a filibuster on gun rights it is hard to count to judy just to be clear here you are saying that even if there were not the nra out there lobbying and of course they are a powerful organization and they give a lot of money you are saying even without that because of the grassroot support for gun rights you believe republican numbers would be what they are carl i do i believe they are responding not just to the nra but from their constituents they hear from their constituents there is a lot of fear in that community that the federal government is out to take their guns of course that is not correct even with the limited universal background checks that people would like to see put in place americans have a lot of opportunity to buy guns but its just this ideological issue and they are not moving away from it even in this setting however these talks might produce something there are some new developments senator john cornyn who of course you know from texas former member of the leadership he seems to be taking part it is his home state people are saying he is someone to look at it is possible but chris murphy snator from connecticut newtown who has been a big leader on gun control efforts in congress said today were going to try were going to give maybe two weeks but there is no agreement we are still going to force votes on the senate floor and get everyone on the record judy we actually spoke with senator murphy here last night what is so interesting is seeing this opposition to any regulation stays so strong despite these rapidfire military style weapons that are being used carl,0.0
gun violence declared a public health crisis in the us,us surgeon general vivek murthy declared gun violence the leading cause of deaths among children and teens a public,causing the norfolk southern train disaster the meeting comes as the department of transportation released a new role yesterday for railroad safety the surgeon general has declared a gun violence of public health crisis in america gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in this country more than half of us adults say they or family member have experienced a gun related incident the first of its kind advisory also lays out strategies that address the crisis there are solutions here we dont have to live like this and i lay out a series of strategies in this advisory that can help us reduce the profound tool of gun violence and help recognize that this is an issue that infiltrated the psyche of america if people are scared in many communities i visited around the country to do normal things like underscore the grocery school there rested about the rest of their life what is this declaration mean reporter the common good to join you this is a first of its kind declaration one of the key goals here is to frame this through a public health lens as you noted gun violence now the leading cause of death in children and teens the report really digs into the impact on individual communities the physical trauma also the mental health told that it is taking gun safety groups ive been talking to they hope that this not only sounds the alarm but serves as a call to action not just at the federal level and two lawmakers but really at the community level and individual things that people can do including talk about safe storage education even encouraging doctors to talk about gun safety and regular health checks gun safety advocates also draw a parallel to the surgeon generals landmark and declamation decades ago back in around to the dangers of smoking and cigarettes they hope that this can lead to a similar change and how this issue is addressed leading to new policy and public health initiatives lindsay just to reiterate this declaration from the surgeon general doesnt necessarily have tea it has a number of suggestions but as you noted there is no force that will cause lawmakers to act on this i do want to note that after the shooting massacre in uvalde texas congress did pass bipartisan legislation to address some gun safety and violence issues but since then stricter measures have faced intense gridlock including a ban on automatic weapons thats something that the surgeon general calls for the biden administration but again short of congressional action the real goal is to get people talking at a number of levels again from the very top two community leaders to try to take a multifaceted approach here,0.0
watch joe bidens gun violence national address,president joe biden called for raising the age to buy high capacity guns to restoring the assault weapons ban and toughening,matters is if were going to listen is he actually going oob able to move the needle in congress here is president biden speaking memorial day this past monday jill and i visited arlington national cemetery as we entered those hallowed grounds we saw rows and rows of crosses among the rows of headstones of other emblems of belief honoring those who payed the ultimate price on battlefields around the world the the day before we visited uvalde uvalde texas in front of rob elementary school we stood before crosses for third and fourth graders and two teachers on each cross a name and nearby a photo of each victim that jill and i reached out to touch innocent victims murdered in a classroom that had been turned into a killing field standing there in that small town like so many other communities across america i couldnt help but think there are too many other schools too many other everyday places that have become killing fields battlefields here in america we stood in such a place days before across from a grocery store in buffalo new york memorializing fellow americans a spouse parent grandparent a sibling gone forever and both places we spent hours with hundreds of family members who were broken and whose lives will never be the same they had one message for all of us do something just do something for gods sake do something after columbine after sandy hook after charleston after orlando after las vegas after parkland nothing has been done this time that cant be true this time we must actually do something the issue we face is one of conscience and common sense for so many of you at home i want to be very clear this is not about taking away anyones guns its not about vilifying gun owners in fact we believe we should be treating responsible gun owners as an example of how every gun owner should behave i respect the culture and the tradition the concerns of lawful gun owners at the same time the second amendment like all other rights is not absolute it was justice celia who wrote and i quote like most rights the right second amendment the rights granted by the second amendment are not unlimited not unlimited it never has been there have always been limitations on what weapons you can own in america for example machine guns have been federally regulated for nearly years and this is still a free country this isnt about taking away anyones rights so im protecting children protecting families its about protecting whole communities its about protecting our freedoms to go to school to a grocery store to a church without being shot and killed according to new data just released by center for disease control and prevention guns are the number one killer of children in the united states of america number one killer more than car accidents more than cancer over the last two decades more schoolage children have died from guns than on duty police officers and active duty military combined think about that more kids than on duty cops killed by guns more kids than soldiers killed by guns for gods sake how much more carnage are we willing to accept how many more innocent american lives must be taken before we say enough enough i know that we cant prevent every tragedy but heres what i believe we have to do heres what the overwhelming majority of american people believe we must do heres what the families in buffalo and uvalde in texas told us we must do we need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines and if we cant ban assault weapons we should raise the age to purchase them from to strengthen background checks enact safe storage law and red flag laws repeal the immunity to protects gun manufacturers from liability address the mental health crisis the trauma from gun violence as a consequence of that violence these are rational common sense measures heres what it all means it all means this we should reinstate the assault weapons ban on high capacity magazines we passed in with bipartisan support in congress and the support of law enforcement nine categories of semi automatic weapons were included in that ban like aks and ars and the ten years it was law mass shootings went down but after republicans let the law expire in those weapons were allowed to be sold again mass shootings tripled those are the facts a few years ago family of the inventor of the ar said he would have been horrified to know his design was being used to slaughter children and other innocent lives instead of being used as a military weapon on the battlefields as it was designed enough enough we should limit how many rounds a weapon can hold why in gods name should an ordinary citizen be able to purchase an assault weapon that holds round magazines that let mass shooters fire hundreds of bullets in a matter of minutes the damage was so devastating in uvalde parents had to do dna swabs to identify the remains of their children nine and yearold children enough we should expand background checks to keep guns out of the hands of felons fugitives and those under restraining orders stronger background checks are something the vast majority of americans including the majority of gun owners agree on i also believe we should have safe storage laws personal reliability for not locking up your gun the shooter at sandy hook came from a home full of guns they were too easy to access thats how he got the weapons the weapon he used to kill his mother and then murder people including first graders if you own a weapon you have a responsibility to secure it every responsible gun owner agrees make sure no one else can have access to it to lock it up to have trigger locks and if you dont and something bad happens you should be held responsible we should also have national red flag laws so that a parent a teacher a counsellor can flag for a court that a child a student a patient is exhibiting violent tendencies threatening classmates or experiencing suicidal thoughts makes them a danger to themselves or to others states in the district columbia have red flag laws the delaware laws to my son attorney general bo biden texas dead injured marjorie stone douglas high school in parkland florida dead injured in both places countless others suffering with invisible wounds red flag laws could have stopped both these shooters in uvalde the shooter was when he asked his sister to buy an assault weapon knowing hed be denied because he was too young to purchase one himself she refused but as soon as he turned he purchased two assault weapons for himself because in texas you can be years old and buy an assault weapon even though you cant buy a pistol in texas until youre if we cant ban assault weapons as we should we must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to look i know some folks will say yearolds can serve in the military and fire those weapons but thats with training and supervision by the besttrained experts in the world dont tell me raising the age wont make a difference enough we should repeal the liability shield that often protects gun manufacturers from being sued for the death and destruction caused by their weapons theyre the only industry in this country that has that kind of immunity imagine if the tobacco industry had been immune from being sued where it would be today the gun industry special protections are outrageous it must end let there be no mistake with the psychological trauma that gun violence leaves behind imagine being that little girl that brave little girl in uvalde who smeared blood off her murdered friends body on her own face to lie still among the corpses in her classroom and pretend she was dead in order to stay alive imagine imagine what it would be like for her to walk down its hallway of any school again imagine what its like for children who experience this kind of trauma everyday in school on the streets in communities all across america imagine what its like for so many parents to hug their children goodbye in the morning not sure whether theyll come back home unfortunately too many people dont have to imagine that at all even before the pandemic people were already hurting theres a serious mental health crisis in this country we have to do something about it thats why mental health is at the heart of my unity agenda that ive layed out in the state of the union address this year we must provide more school counsellors more school nurses more mental health services for students and teachers more people volunteering as mentors to help young people succeed more processing protection and resources to keep kids safe from the harms of social media this you knew unity agenda wont fully heal the wounded souls but it helps it matters i told you what ill do the question now is what will the congress to house of representatives already passed key measures we need expanding background checks to cover nearly all gun sales including at gun shows and online sales getting rid of a loophole allows a gunsale to go through after three business days even if the background check has not been completed planning even more action next week safe storage requirements the banning of high capacity magazines raise the age to buy an assault weapon to federal red flag law codifying my ban on ghost guns that dont have serial numbers and cant be traced this time we have to take the time to do something this time its time for the senate to do something but as we know in order to do to get anything done in the senate we need a minimum of republican senators i support the bipartisan efforts that include small group of democrats republican senators trying to find a way but my god the fact that the majority of the senate republicans dont want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote i find unconscionable we cant fail the american people again since uvalde just over a week ago there have been other mass shootings in america each with four or more people killed or injured including yesterday at a hospital in tulsa oklahoma shooter deliberately targeted a surgeon using an assault weapon he bought just a few hours before his rampage that left a surgeon another doctor receptionist and patient dead and many more injured that doesnt count the carnage we see every single day that doesnt make the headlines ive been in this fight for a long time i know how hard it is but ill never give up and if congress fails i believe this time a majority of the american people wont give up either i believe the majority of you will act and turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote enough enough enough over the next days the families in uvalde will continue burying their dead will take that long in part was its a town where everyone knows everyone and day by day they will honor each one they lost jill and i met with the owner and staff from the funeral home being strong strong strong to take care of their own and the people of uvalde mourned as they do over the next days what will we be doing as a nation jill and i met with the sister of the teacher who was murdered and whose husband died of a heart attack two days later leaving behind four beautiful orphaned children all now orphans the sister asked us what could she say what could she tell her nieces and nephews the most heartbreaking moments that i can remember all i could think to say was i told her to hold them tight hold them tight in the visit to the school we tended mass at catholic heart church mass in the pews family and friends held each other tightly as the arch bishop spoke he asked the children in attendance to come up to altar and sit at the altar with them there wasnt enough room so mom and her young son sat next to jill and me in the first pew and as we left the church grandmother who just lost her granddaughter passed me a handwritten letter it read erase the invisible line that is dividing our nation come up with a solution and fix whats broken and make the changes necessary to prevent this happening again end of quote my fellow americans enough enough its time for each of us to do our part its time to act for the children weve lost for the children we can save for the nation we love lets hear the call and the cry lets meet the moment let us finally do something god bless the families who are hurting god bless you all from the st psalm in my church may he raise you on eagles wings and bury you on the breath of dawn may he shine you like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand thats my prayer f,0.0
the gun violence epidemic in america,the country is reeling from the shootings of ralph yarl kaylin gillis cheerleaders in texas and a family in north carolina who,of course for as the th hour gets underway on thisthursday night thursday night good evening once again i stephanie ruhle its a question we ask on this program every time that we report on the latest outbrea of gun violence when are we going to d something to solve for thi uniquely american problem that question has become eve more urgent over the last week one where we have seen a alarming series of shootings involving people who mad simple mistakes just doin stuff we do every single day but they were met with bullets the latest in north carolina late yesterday a man allegedly fired at his neighbors after a basketball rolled into his yard sixyearold kingsley white an her dad were both shot and wounded we of course reported on kansa city teenager ralph yarl who shot in the head and arm las week after he rang the wrong doorbell picking up hi brothers he is now recovering at home over the weekend yearol cahlan gilles and her friend just pulled into the wrong driveway in new york she was shot dead when the own homer opened fire at the car and texas cheerleader payton washington and heather rot were shot after mistakenly getting into the wrong car outside a grocery store on tuesday peyton was critically injured as one guest told us last night hair trigger justice now seems to be almost the norm there is another deepl troubling element all of thi and it relates to the shooting of young ralph yarl the grandson of the yearol man charged in that shooting put it this way i feel like a lot of people in that generation are caugh up in this hour news cycl of fear and paranoia perpetuated by some other news stations he was fully into that an watched fox news all day every day blaring in his living room and i think that stuff reall reinforces the negative view o minority groups and leaves people to be it doesnt as early lead peopl to be racist but it reinforce and galvanizes racist people it is a concerning an terrifying world view that i unfortunately not unique meanwhile in washington senator chris murphy pointed out that these shootings are highlighting another ver disturbing trend we also just need to as some deeper questions about why people in america ar just so unhappy and so alone that they would resort t violence this regularly an this casually there is also an anxiety fearfulness in this nation earlier today we heard from former first lady michelle obama who said she wants to se more americans demanding actio to curve gun violence i hope and pray that at som point enough becomes enough we wonder that throughout th entire presidency or the end only developed country on the planet wher citizens can have on access unfettered access to firearms that is not a good thing and more of us need to fee strongly about it here we are talking about all of this exactly years ago to the day when tee aged students and one teache were brutally murdered at he shooting in columbine high school in colorado with that lets get smart of with our lead off panel this morning former new york prosecutor i civil rights attorney generals coleman frank saluzzi former fb director for counter intelligence and a former firearm executives who helped build on of the worlds most iconic gun companies hes now a senior adviser at the gun safety organization and he wrote gunfight m battle against the industr that radicalized america ryan you are the first person i wanted to talk to tonigh when you look at these shootings what do they tell yo about gun culture and th climate in this country today well thank you have me on stephanie and as much as i appreciat being on with you i wish it was not this regular you know what it tells me i that this is not a surprise we have a system a politica system that profits on fear an conspiracy and hatred and it i wound around firearms industry that helps propagate tha because fear and intimidatio also cells of fire arms now we put about to millio new firearms into the united states market in the last thre years people are obviously ver fearful many of the irrationally many of them as the grandson of the guy from kansas city says the fear and conspiracy has been stoked wit media and they have a gun sittin there and they are ready to us it i am really not shocked that these things are happening i am shocked that they are not happening even more regularl that they already are frank think about when w are young the amount of mistaken doorbells that we rang ho many times we got lost in cars with our friends even pranks that w intentionally pulled things are completely differen now beyond the sheer number of guns what is it that is makin people respond to just mistake with gunfire stephanie i think many americans have allowed themselves permitte themselves to be programed through social media throug the cable news the television they watch all day and all night through their echo chambers rabbit holes tha they are stuck in seeking affirmation from each other the politicians and the gu lobby is more than happy t feed that programming becaus it is a for profit programming and so the worst fear that ha been mentioned fear is drivin this but it is an irrationa fear we are now seeing the kind o intercity crime that peopl have almost become numb to go to the suburbs as people shoot each other for nonsensical reasons and where is that fear comin from it is programming violent crime is going to ge you it is way after the facts dont seem to matter by th way jim jordan with the help of hearing in manhattan claimin that crime is out of control there the facts do not seem to justify that nonetheless that is what we are being fed people of other races are ou to get to we accept that we get fed that and so when the doorbell rings or the basketball comes into your yard your first respons is to pull the gun which yo are now allowed to have withou a permit or training you pull it you do not know how to us it and east are killing innocent people it is a programming that i occurring the deprogramming question i much tougher to answer it is going to take a long tim to get out of this whole the first problem you mentioned intercity gun violence that we are numb to we should not be charles last night april ryan was here and she said somethin chilling that has been on my mind for the last hours and i want to share it with you watch this i think about this as a parent my older year old daughter will be has gone to pick u her younger sister who is several times from white communities and it really makes a parent shudder could this really happen there is a syndrome now in thi nation with hair trigger justice we heard the grandson of th alleged shooter of ralph errol talk about why these incidents take on a different meaning in the black community especiall for black man absolutely stephanie in order for america to be wha it can it has to be hones about what it is and the truth is when youre talking about what it is i violence is embedded i americas dna racism is another thing that w have to deal with as being embedded in americas dna these two things when you add in the element that fran mentioned around profit i creates the type of storm that we are dealing with wit respect to quick heretic o justice that april talke about and this is the type of thin that allows for me to say wit confidence and with clarity that the way that i navigates basis the way that people wh look like me navigate spaces is said to be different,0.0

gun violence has become a kids issue us surgeon general declares it public health crisis,us surgeon general vivek murthy declared gun violence a public health crisis dr murthy joins ana cabrera to explain why hes,this morning the us this morning the us surgeon general declaring gun violence on public health crisis in a new advisory dr vivek murthy noted gun violence is the leading cause of death for children in the us and there needs to be a collective commitment to turn the tide of firearm violence writing quote a public health approach could guide our strategy and actions as it has done in the past with successful efforts to address tobacco related disease and motor vehicle crashes and this comes a week after the surge general called for warnings on social media thank you so much for taking the time why are you calling for this now gun violence has become a public health crisis in america and its one having farreaching consequences for millions of americans the highest price we pay for gun violence is the lives we lose and for one person that loses their life theres two injured there are millions of others who listen and hear about gun violence each and every day that has led to a directive trauma in our country where out of people are worried about losing a loved one to gun violence more than half of our kids are worried about a shooting in school most importantly and this is important to me as a parent gun violence has become the leading cause of death among children and teens it was not true a decade ago or two decades ago and its true today gun violence has become a kids issue and its a public health issue that merits a public health approach we have taken public health approaches to tobacco and carrelated deaths over the years and been able to reduce the toll of the public health challenges and we can do the same thing here with gun violence and its urgent we do so let me reiterate what you said as a parent it hits home with me as well gun violence kills more children than any other cause surpassing car accidents the amount of children dying from gun violence is five times higher than canada and times higher than australia thats mindblowing why is that what will change with this advisory what is actually actionable the good news is theres a lot we can do to address gun violence many people look at the issue and see its been polarized and politicized and one of my goals here is to take the issue out of the realm of politics and put it into the realm of public health which is where it belongs what history also told us is that even though its a complex and complicated issue we can do hard things as a country in when the surgeon general issued a report on tobacco for the first time many people at that time said you know this is part of the fabric of america smoking kids smoke doctors smoked at that time and nearly half of the country smoked and because that report catalyzed a series of actions at the community level and schools and lawmaking bodies we were able to reduce smoking from to below and thats real progress i laid out a series of strategies to expand community violence programs and i put forth strategies around firearm risk reduction as well as well as expansion of mental health services which together can help us address the lives lost and the lives changed and deeply affected by gun violence once something is declared a public health crisis besides making that symbolic statement what changes does it empower doctors or authorities in a new way what we have seen historically when the surge generals office identified as a public health crisis it does give doctors community leaders educators and lawmakers tools and ideas that they can use to help address this crisis thats what this advisory contains if there was nothing we could do about the problem that would be one thing but theres a lot we can do we have to act with urgency though because what is at stake is the health and wellbeing of our children heres the statement from the nra responding to this action quote this is an extension of the biden administrations war on lawabiding gun owners america has a crime problem caused by criminals the reluctance to prosecute and punish criminals on the part of the biden administration and many of his allies is the primary cause of that thats a simple fact they argue what is your response well this is one of the reasons its so important for us to understand the science and the facts behind gun violence when you dig in you will find as we laid out in our advisory that about of gun violencerelated deaths are suicides and of them are homicides theres another smaller percent around that include accidental deaths like when a child finds an unlocked and loaded weapon in the home and winds up hurting themselves or somebody else,0.0
homicides have been related to gun violence in atlanta so far this year,with the summer season police and community organizations are working to make sure that number does not increase,atlanta police says the department reports nearly homicides theyve investigated this year alone were related to gun violence and you know this is concerning because the summer is beginning and one local woman hopes her work will prevent another person from losing their life heres lives cares belcher as weather gets warmer and more people begin to gather charmaine brown says she wants to prevent more shootings in the city of atlanta a man shot and killed in mechanicsville another in riverside and a woman killed in a downtown atlanta high rise all three happening within the last days charmaine brown has spent the last seven years of her life trying to prevent tragedies like these im saddened by it im saddened by it because gun gun violence is preventable brown started jareds their success after her son the organizations namesake was hit by a stray bullet its definitely a lot more needs to be done and its going to take the entire community today she says giving young people the tools to prevent shootings is more important than ever and so its so important for the youth to listen listen to your parents and then also if they hear of something thats going on in the community be dont be afraid to not say anything about it speak up resolving conflict and working with their community in addition to browns work atlanta police have advice for the public to help prevent more shootings mainly not leaving guns unattended so theyre not used in other crimes in atlanta im karis belger alive news,0.0
what can we do about gun violence the problem with jon stewart apple tv,the problem with jon stewart is now streaming on apple tv bad guys have guns good,yes weve lost the war on guns personally i knew it was over after sandy hook we had a chance to pick guns or kindergarteners and we went with guns there are million guns in america and i dont want to be judgy but i think its gotten absurd hunting season has arrived diamond hunting season that is if you have your sights set on this you can get this free from lee anns fine jewelry laughter singing every kill begins with k laughter so here oh applause ive really missed that laughter so heres the deal the problem with guns is that theres too many of them and while research clearly shows mo guns mo deaths lets defer to the victors in this war mr nra do you have any thoughts on how the rest of us could die less lean in listen to me now go on and never forget these words spit it out to stop a bad guy with a gun it takes a good guy with a gun yes why didnt i think of that shootouts one question very quickly how can you tell whos a good guy you know what maybe i guess just ask them im sure people are generally honest about that i was a good guy on the street im sure bruce inaudible hell tell you i was always a good guy laughter oj gets a gun laughter its probably fine not his weapon of choice allegedly ooh crowd reactslaughter are you taking ojs side did that really just happen oj knife joke and theyre like hey buddy laughter hes paid his dues laughter you know what actually theyre right doesnt make sense you know whats probably better dont let somebody tell you themselves theyre probably going to lie references because everyones going to say theyre a good guy maybe you know if a guy is good if a different good guy gives them a vouch theres a guy id like to really thank here that people dont thank enough but theres a kindly wonderful gentle man that we all deeply love his name is harvey weinstein laughter harvey weinstein gets a gun laughter you know what this isnt going to work were not going to be able to define good guys so lets just focus on maybe keeping guns away from bad guys like terrorists they shouldnt have guns a loophole in federal gun laws allows suspected terrorists to buy guns here in the us and they have what the fuck if youre on the terrorist watch list you can have a gun ok what about registered sex offenders oh it turns out sex offenders apparently also need guns so we obviously cant agree on who the good guys are and we cant seem to agree on who the bad guys are so what are we supposed to do here its not a scifi tom cruise movie where we have some magical premonition of which bad guys are about to commit a violent crime and can intervene in the crime before its too late or is it it appears a domestic dispute led to the massacre at a texas church that left at least people dead the gunman devin kelley had a history of domestic violence the gop shooting at the baseball diamond he had a history of domestic violence reports of domestic abuse domestic violence domestic violence complaints against him and an allegation of domestic violence history of domestic violence six arrests for domestic violence domestic violence domestic violence years old and already has a domestic violence history domestic violence offenders it turns out domestic violence is a predictor for gun violence in fact theres a study that suggests a felony domestic violence conviction is the single greatest predictor of future violent crime among men this is our scifi movie fix because if we simply kept guns away from domestic violence offenders we could potentially stop of mass shootings of child firearm deaths more than of women ok im sorry fuck load laughter every hours an american woman is shot dead by an intimate partner you might not care about any of that and if youre the type of person who doesnt care about any of that i do think i know an area that may speak to you more two police officers shot and killed responding to a domestic violence call a rookie police officer was gunned down responding to a domestic violence call shot and killed early this morning responding to a domestic violence call shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call responding to a domestic violence call shot and killed in the line of duty they were reportedly responding to a domestic violence call it turns out removing guns from domestic violence offenders also backs the blue between to domestic dispute calls made up of all fatal police calls for police domestic violence calls are the single most dangerous calls that they respond to so why are we letting these wifebeating copkillers get away with literal mass murder and why is the lifetime channel the only network covering this phenomenon hours a day laughter oh tiffani amber thiessen i hope you get out laughter you guys saw that one too right yeah its entertaining but i saw it coming we treat domestic violence

the impact of gun violence on survivors in america,katy tur sat down with nelba marquezgreene who lost her daughter ana grace in the sandy hook shooting and shenee,the shooting stops or when the cameras go away if the cameras are there to gen with the mother of yearold anna grace who was killed in the sandy hook elementary school shooting she is a licensed marriage and family therapist halls shan nay johnson her fiancee was murdered in new york while she was two months pregnant with her now yearold son in her yearold son kendrick was murdered in queens new york weeks before his high school graduation she is now a volunteer with moms demand action and founder of the kendrick murrow junior foundation laid thank you for coming and having this incredibly tough conversation with me i want to gen with you the funerals for the uvalde children and the two teachers the funerals begin today two of them your family and marriage counselor therapist you must be through this before what do these families need from us right now i would think to give them space to give them space to give them time to follow their lead to not push them to make statements or decisions that you know are in perhaps other peoples best interests but maybe not their own follow their space respect their space follow their lead give them time you know i really wanted to talk to you you are an incredibly powerful speaker on school shootings guns healing recovering what families can do and how they recover but you also agreed to do the interview i want to say shanay because a part of the reason is the violence that you have experienced doesnt get covered in the same way you lost your fiancee and you lost your son and you told a powerful story about taking one of your other sons to the er and being asked by the doctor because you know he got into had an accident atika rate the doctor asked how many kids you had you said in that moment you struggled to answer already you had three or four kids because you lost one you didnt want to say four and give their ages and didnt want to say three then it would feel like you are erasing his memory tell me what it is like to be the mother of somebody who died from gun violence that doesnt get this sort of attention its difficult you know and i worked so hard to continue to keep kendricks life and legacy alive you know he was a great kid he was murder three weeks before his high school graduation and i decided that no one else is going to keep his memory alive i will it seams feel to you that some gun deaths in this country are quoteunquote tragic than others if so what do you think that says about us and how we do things here well that itself the thing its not the tragedies arent different to the families every day there are more than plus people murdered by gun violence so today there will be more families suffering and more coverage or less coverage doesnt take that pain away it doesnt take the suffering away from the families what have you done about it what is the fix right now according to shanay that we all work together that the issue doesnt get lost in the issues kendrick was a real person you know i think i missed the politics we forget that sometimes but we need a team to work together and have unity in the senate and they can pass stronger gun laws and also on the local level if we work together we can prevent so many tragedies from happening well want to work together we see nothing but inaction when it comes from our law makers theyre trying right now but there is a real partisan divide some people out there when you say contacted you and not say to you you need to show the autopsy pictures of your child after the shooting i guess with the idea that if you show americans show lawmakers just how bad it is how horrible it is that that will spur them to action what do you think when you get those requests it has been an incredibly difficult peek the fever pitch cry for the focus of the children have never been this high i need many earthquake to hold on to hope i need america to commit to action and not demand of families who are suffering but we need to learn to be people who ask more of the powerful and less of those hurting asking me for pictures right now is not withhat you need it is a very disrespectful and damaging act working your gifts and skill set and demand action of your leaders demand action in your community but do not ask me for those pictures it has been an incredibly difficult week are you okay together with shanay and the mothers who are standing asking for the right things we are going to be okay for our kids and for ourselves and for our families what about you shanay i wasnt okay this week just two weeks ago i had to visit kendricks grave site two weeks ago was the tragic anniversary of the death may th so between that and the daily toll of gun violence in buffalo and uvalde i wasnt okay i will get comfortable with saying im not okay all the time you know that i shouldnt just adjust to this so no im not okay am i hoping yes i am coping with it are you hopeful when you say you are coping are you hopeful smr i am very hope i have been fighting for years i am very hope i show that hope in my local community when i work with the youth in my community because we are fighting for them for their lives so yes i am very hopeful do you think something will get done in congress will there be enough outrage enough of a sense that this has gone too far for there to be something happening on guns if its just background checks is that going to be enough to stop this sort of violence maybe enough for some violence but the sort of violence we see not just at these schools but on a daily basis in this country i think we need to vote them out our leaders who are putting profit over policy who are doing more than human beings we should vote them out because more and more lives are every day we are losing people out children are dying thats more,0.0

chicago starting at pm on friday until sunday night people were shot twelve died over one threehour window one person wasshot on average every six minutes violence in chicago is not new but behindthose numbers are stories of the victims and their families an aunt kisses the photo of he niece yearoldjahnae patterson killed by a gunshot on sunday a bicycle that yearold kenny ivory wasriding when he was shot in the abdomen and the scene on sunday outside stroger hospital the youngest victim this weekend was theoldest victim for more on all this we turn to two chicagoresidents tamar manasseh a community activist and founder of mothers and men against senselesskillings and lance williams associate professor of urban affairs northeastern illinois university thanks very much to you both lance williams let me start with you a lot of this violence was centered aroundthe west side of chicago the south side of chicago why are we seeing this violence today focusedin those neighborhoods lance williams northeastern illinois universitywell youre seeing the violence on the west side and the south sides of chicago becauseabout years ago in the early s the city of chicago implemented some very verybad public policy the most damaging of those policies was thepolicy of renaissance when chicago basically privatized through charter schools neighborhoodpublic elementary and high schools it became a serious problem because manyof the high schools and communities that had long traditions of street organizations causedyoung africanamerican males to be afraid to leave out of their communities going tonew schools throughout the city of chicago so basically from the early s too manyyoung africanamerican males havent been going to school meaning that they dont havelife prospects they cant get jobs theyre selfmedicated to deal with the stressin their community and its driving a lot of the violence nick schifrin tamar manasseh i want to showwhat you do i want to show a photo of you working every day you sit on the corner of th streetand south stewart avenue cooking dinner for neighborhood kids what are you trying to do tamar manasseh founder mothers and men againstsenseless killings im trying to keep them alive thats what im trying to do and for the past four years i have been successfulwith hot dogs and hamburgers and chicken and hugs and love and consistency thats what i have been doing nobody gets shot there and its not just about the kids its about the wellness of the entire community so we not only feed children there we feed adults as well so were feeding upwards of people everynight nick schifrin lance williams food providingsomething kind of community feeling is that some of the solutions lance williams oh absolutely and i think you know what tamar doing isan incredible job it would be great if she was given more resourcesto expand and ramp up the kind of environment see this is the stress that is going onin the community that shes addressing directly she is creating an environment where its you know the food and the love and the hugs and the kisses and the mothers out onthe block actually reduce the stress for the young men in the community which makes themless inclined to engage in violence nick schifrin tamar manasseh i want to askabout what the police chief and the mayor said this weekend they mentioned that gangs were behind a lotof this violence and they also said the police chief saidthat they need the communitys help to catch the perpetrators does that sound like the right solution tamar manasseh not at all not to me it doesnt april eddie johnson gave a press conferencewhere he touted technology as what had helped bring down the numbers of violent crime inchicago it was the shooting spotter and it was allof this new technology that they employed and thats what did it im not just you know im not the onlyorganization thats out in the neighborhood inaudible make a difference on the groundevery day its not just me there are other organizations just likeme who are out here every day in their own way making a contribution to making communitiesbetter he not once mentioned them he said it was the technology and it was extrapolicing and it was actual overpolicing that made the difference but now you need the communitys help whenyou have so many of the resources that could be given to the community englewood will not have any public schoolsin the fall and these kids that professor williams spokeof they will have no options of a public high school in englewood but yet the police have all the resources but youre looking to the community to helpyou when you just said that the community wasnt a part of that when it was technologythat did it and its kind of like the day after he madethat statement cpd got another million donation when i mean organizations likemine are struggling every day that have been shown to actually have results just to makesure people get fed just to make sure that we can actually actually provide a safeplace every day for the community to come and be a community for neighbors to comeand intermingle with neighbors and people to come and meet people and to become a communityagain we have to actually you know beg and borrowto make that happen when the police department they have all of these resources its clearly not going to public schools for every school you close for every teacherthat loses a job thats one more of these thugs or gangbangers that are created so no you cant lay this at the feet ofthe community right now you have to lay this at the feet of the cityand the cpd when you remove resources what do you expect this is what you will get cpd needs to tell us what happened they need to tell us why this happened they owe us answers this isnt for the community to take careof its for the city to tell us why this is happening nick schifrin tamar manasseh lance williamsthank you very much to you both lance williams thank

what is behind the rise in gun related violence in the us,so far this year there have already been mass shootings in the united states and new data shows the leading cause of,the pbs news weekend geoff gun violence is surging across the us so far this year there have already been mass shootings and new data shows the leading cause of death among children in was gunrelated injuries for more on whats behind these numbers i spoke with jennifer mascia she is a reporter for the trace a nonpartisan nonprofit newsroom focused on americas gun violence crisis jennifer mascia thanks so much for being with us and three mass shootings last weekend alone underscored what has been a monthlong spate of gun violence across this country based on your research your data analysis what accounts for it jennifer well we have seen a surge in gun sales that accelerated greatly during the pandemic a lot of americans their ideas of security and safety are wrapped up in firearm ownership we actually had mass shootings last weekend the three that made the news and there were nine others where four or more people were shot in a single incident this is happening earlier than we usually see it two years ago right at the onset of the pandemic there were mass shootings at this time january through april last year there were that is a big leap this year so far we have had so it seems that was something of a turning point and the violence is happening earlier and earlier in the year now geoff so gun violence is going up but the crime rate is going down that to me seems counterintuitive how do you account for those two trends jennifer yes all types of crime actually are going down but gun violence is going up probably because there are million guns in civilian hands in this country it is simple math the more guns that are around the more people are going to use them geoff last week as you know georgia became the th state to eliminate the need for a concealed care permit so that means in half of the country now have you can carry a concealed gun with no permit and no training how does that compound the issue jennifer if there are no permits they cant really check to see if that person is legally carrying so you have people going out with guns in public who are not trained and dont have that extra layer of vetting and weve seen law enforcement across the country come out against these bills and it just doesnt seem to matter to the lawmakers and theyre the ones who have to deal with it on the ground geoff i want to ask you about this new study by the university of michigan researchers there who found that the leading cause ofea dth among kids in was gunrelated injuries kids obviously cant buy firearms but theyre still getting access to them jennifer theyre getting access because in most of the country there are no laws that criminalize leaving guns accessible to children so you have a situation where there are millions of guns in households and there is no safety training that goes with that theres no mandatory class about how to keep a gun secure and safe and theres no laws really in gunrelated injuries became the leading cause of death among kids thats actually in line with the huge jump we saw in gun deaths between and it put us above gun deaths in a single year now we have never even breached before that it was a huge jump and it was driven largely by homicides geoff so gun control is not moving really anywhere it is entirely stalled the biden administration has talked about providing more funding for community intervention the president signed a bill regulating socalled ghost guns what needs to happen to sort of move the needle here jennifer the most successful gun violence prevention strategy would be controlling access to firearms unfortunately federal background checks only cover percent of gun sales and thats written into our federal law so you have almost a quarter of gun sales happening legally with no background check states who are taking it upon themselves to craft laws but the problem is if the state next door has weak gun laws you can just go get a gun there geoff jennifer thanks for your time and for you,0.0

cdc director speaks out on us gun violence epidemic,the director of the us centers for disease control and prevention the nations top public health agency is speaking out,after decades of silence the cdc is speaking up about americas gun violence epidemic the gun violence archive reports every weekend this summer more than people have been killed on average and nearly injured an exclusive interview with cnns eliz betd cohen cdc director rochelle walensky is announcing what she plans to do about it this is unusual for a cdc director to speak like this it is you would think they have been speaking up for years now right gun violence kills tens of thousands americans a year its clearly a public health threat but actually for the past about years cdc directors have been pretty much silent on the topic of gun violence the fear was that the more they talked that the nra the powerful gun lobby would pressure congress to make more cuts in cdcs budget but in my exclusive interview with dr walensky she says its time to speak up reporter guns you shot that guy in the stomach reporter they leave a toll of death and despair across america mass shootings the shots just kept coming we were going down when we got down there was a man that was shot right there reporter urban violence we have a victim over here with gunshots wounds to the left and to the chest reporter road rage he said mommy my tummy hurts so she went and she picked him up and he was bleeding on her reporter suicides he walked into a gunshot at somewhere between and pm that afternoon he shot himself reporter while americans have begged for an end to this violence were not going to leave reporter the national rifle association is a powerful force in washington semiautomatic firearm technology has been around for years theyre the most popular guns for hunting target shooting self defense reporter in the s the nra convinced congress to cut all of cdcs funding for gun research a loss equivalent to millions of dollars a year fearing further cuts cdc leaders publicly were all but silent for decades even as tens of thousands of americans died from gun violence year after year after year but now in a stunning turn the current director of the cdc is announcing a plan to reduce gun violence sharing exclusively with cnn this is actually a stunning moment that a director of the cdc is even talking about this issue is even using the word guns it hasnt happened in years and years everyday we turn on the news and there are more young people dying i swore to the president and to this country that i would protect your health this is clearly one of those moments one of those issues that is harming americas health reporter but theres a reason why your predecessors didnt address it perhaps i want to share reporter were used to hearing dr rochelle walensky talk about the covid pandemic vaccine is a top priority reporter this is her first interview on americas epidemic on gun violence we had people shot in one weekend in chicago that same weekend party in florida five teenagers shot that same weekend a man in new york city in times square shot in the back and the list goes on and on week after week after week can anything be done about this something has to be done about that so firearmrelated deaths a year serious firearmrelated injuries per year the scope of the problem is just bigger than were even hearing about and when your heart wrenches everyday you turn on the news youre only hearing the tip of the iceberg reporter when you wake up on a monday morning and you hear all the reports the children who were shot the previous weekend cdc director what does that feel like to you thats heavy it hurts it hurt before i was cdc director i think any american citizen that turns on the news just cant fathom another one of these mass violence issues reporter dr walenskys strategy restart the gun research my job is to understand and evaluate the problem to understand the scope of the problem to understand why this happens and what are the things that can make it better to research that to scale that up to evaluate it and to make sure we can integrate it into communities we have a lot of work to do in every single one of those areas because we havent done a lot of work as a nation for almost any of them reporter this time she wants the cdc to find common ground with gun owners lets agree we dont want people to die lets agree there reporter she wants to allay gun owners fears generally the word gun for those worried about research in this area is followed by the word control thats not what i want to do here im not here about gun control im here about preventing gun violence and gun death reporter and wants to involve gun owners in the cdc research to save lives im afraid you want to take away my gun and my answer is come be part of the solution come to the table join us in the conversation i dont want you to feel that way right i want you to teach me what you have done to make your gun safe and then i want you to teach everybody else reporter dr walenskys plan has brought her here to vermont to help solve this problem according to a study in the united states an estimated million children lived with a loaded and unlocked gun that number has likely increased dramatically since then i pledge allegiance to the flag reporter these children in vermont are learning how to shoot guns and how to store them safely a gun own r and an energy room physician teaches this h community program how do we keep your guns here at h how are they stored reporter by funding this program and studying what they do and repeating it across the country dr walensky hopes to prevent accidental gun deaths among children cdc is here were here because today youre our teachers wasnt to learn from you reporter the cdc is also funding this project at gun shops to help put a stop to gun suicides its a poster that talks about how gun owners can help different signs to look for the doctor knows that dr walensky will get push back when gun owners hear that the federal government the cdc wants to reduce gun violence what do they hear i think at the on the other hand of the day theyre worried about gun confiscation dr walensky stands firm are you worried that saying the word guns or talking about firearms that youre going to get a whole sector of the united states just really angry of course i also worry that if woe dont do anything about it we have a whole sector of the united states thats really angry how high a priority is this for you this is one of the leading killers of our young people in this country its a high priority we dont know if the nra is going to fight dr walensky on her initiatives that group is having their own legal and financial issues its unclear if they have the strength to muster much of a fight that was really interesting discussion and time spent wi,0.0
how to reduce gun violence without taking people s guns,how to reduce gun violence without taking peoples guns watch the newest video from big think,michael dowling gun violence is a nationalcrisis we have about deaths last year fromgun violence this is just not about guns this is a serious public health issue and we had got to look at it that way for example fewer people die from car accidentsyet weve spent an awful lot of time over the last couple of decades wondering abouthow do we make cars safe we didnt ban cars we figured out how to make them safe i remember the discussion with ralph naderway back when he said i want to put seat belts in the cars everybody said youre not we wont be able to afford a car it will destroy the car industry the manufacturers cant do it its an invasion of privacy i dont want to have anybody tell me whatthe hell to do when i sit in my own car yet today try to buy a car without a seatbelt we got air bags we got child supports in the car we have safety standards its the same with guns in my view you can have a gun lets figure it out how to use them safely health is a lot more than the absence of illness and promoting health is a lot more than dealingwith medical care we have to be much more holistic in our approach and gun violence preventions part of it the effect of guns is not measured by the deaths thats easy to measure but what are the downstreameffects of this in many of these communities and to the public at large when youre running a healthcare organizationwe see it each and every day millions of people end up in the hospitalas a result of gun violence we treat people who come to us with gun injuries we treat the people that come to us with trauma we treat mental health issues we treat domestic violence victims over of americans believe that somethingshould be done about gun safety including gun owners i think people are afraid to talk about itbecause people automatically jump to the issue of oh you want to ban guns im not against guns im against the unnecessary ill effect ofguns that do terrible harm to people we need rational discussions and a call toaction on this issue now the lessons here that if we continueto be persistent about the health effects of gun violence the trauma the effect onkids the effect on communities the effect on all the people the physical effects thesocial effects the environmental effects and we continue messaging that over and overand over again you will make a difference it will happen it is time for healthcare leaders that treatgun violence as a public health issue prevention is important when people come in to our emergency roomswhat we typically do and have been doing for years and years and years we assess therisk factors to their health so we ask questions about alcoholism we ask questions about domestic violence we ask questions about drug abuse its all part of the risk assessment of determiningwhat might be of danger health wise to that individual or that family so we should be asking questions about gunviolence have you heard gunshots in your neighborhood has anybody ever put a gun to your head is there a gun at home are they secure so youll ask a whole series of questionslike that and then you will find out that many of thesepeople especially kids young teens may be in danger of gun violence as well as provideservices to those people who are affected as a result of gun violence educating the future generations of providersis very very important and guns and gun violence is going to be part of this we now educate physicians not just in thehospital but out in the community going into peoples homes going into thecommunities understanding the communities understanding what effect that circumstancehas on the persons health healthcare is local were in the communities all the time we saw evidence of this during covid it was a wonderful trust that was built upbetween healthcare professionals health care providers of all kinds and the community weve got to continue to intensify that relationshipand continue to maintain and build that trust there are many local entities that are verykey to partner with community agencies social service agenciesare the local family service league the local police department organizations like that are very very key more and more now many of these communitiesthe effect of guns is important to them the safety is important to them their security is important to them we got to work with these people we cant just do it ourselves you cant just stand by and see the resultsfrom the impact of guns on the street so we decided years ago to set up the centerfor gun violence prevention then the goal is to educate broaden peoplesviews build alliances build coalitions we call it a learning collaborative we want all of these people to get together so we educate and learn from one another you dont ever accomplish a hell of a lotby sitting on the sidelines and whining get into the

gun violence and us tourism,countries have issued travel advisories for citizens thinking of visiting the us partly due to our rise in gun violence,if it feels like you are if it feels like you are hearing about gun violence and mass shootings more than ever before its because you are so far has recorded at least mass killings putting the united states on track to put the record at mass shootings in a single year according to the washington post this has more than doubled the number of mass killings recorded by the this point last year which was eight and all of there were a total of mass killings of gunfire in the us thats an average of three per month if that number of deaths skiers you or upsets you then you are not alone in fact those sentiments are shared by the millions of international tourists who visit the united states each year they are seeing the same headlines we are about mass shootings at dance halls malls banks and its giving some of them second thought about taking their next vacation here in fact at least seven countries have told their citizens to be careful when visiting america travel advisories partly due to our rise in gun violence join me now noah prince be national political editor noah thank you for being here you know the state department issued a level one to level four in terms of the travel advisory level one being its okay level for being you should not go there are these other countries legitimately saying you definitely should not come to the united states i would not liken this to when the us do when you visit the caribbean country you may see a headline and say bahamas the medical republic jamaica they have some crime issues but in large it is not prohibit people from booking their vacation there but if you saw a headline ever single week about a crime in one of the caribbean countries you would probably rethink it thats whats starting to happen in america our good headlines are resonating more in places like japan europe australia some of the drivers of the international tourism economy and the concern is if we go in a direction where that is a daily headline in that area some travelers might think twice conversely we as the us are doing a disservice to foreign and visitors to tourists because we downplayed it for purposes of trying to achieve better tourism statistics its hard to get people in the tourism industry to talk about it they dont want to appear at headlines they dont want to appear in foreign headlines i talked i spoke to a half dozen tourism groups and alum reached back with any sort of comments in terms of disservice i mean america by and large is one of the safest countries in the world for big tourism places but we do have a gun problem compared to other developed countries our overall crime is pretty much in line we have numbers i was looking at this earlier we have gun homicides per million people in america that is times higher than japans numbers times higher than the uk but the overall crime numbers are pretty much in line with all of the other big developed countries in the world so if youre an american tourism expert someone in the industry you need to do a better job in the wake of all of these headlines in convincing international tourists that is it is safe to come here because it is generally safe to visit america we are talking about perceptions perceptions dont match reality what do you know in terms of what you looked into what did you discover in terms of whether or not perception is meeting reality the problem is for american tourism we are seeing more headlines in recent years largely because the types of shootings the school shootings in particular have really changed to the media coverage abroad that is leaving tourists potential tourists travelers really befuddled in places like europe where we draw so many tourists talking to travelers i have been talking to academics i want to show you what one professor told me trying to explain how they cannot fathom american gun culture sure take a listen when a bit personal we dont understand how one lobby in particular the gun lobby has such a powerful voice in what is going on in what appears on the side of this world the freeze completely mad used by multiple people i spoke to in the uk they cannot fathom how a sophisticated wealthy country like the us continues to maintain the status quo with the gun laws i can answer that question for the gentleman and others its the gop that refuses i want to switch gears we are looking at international to coming into the us but i want to talk about inside the united states from the state of florida we are usually inundated with tourists lately you have seen the aclu the naacp and a new immigration law being passed by desantis it is the league of united latin american citizens issue in travel advisories actually saying dont go to a state like florida because of its lax gun laws because of the anti woke laws because of the hatred against certain minorities have you also seen a and attacked the trends when it comes to that travel advisories within the us tried to limit travel or interstate commerce into other states from the people i talked to it seems like its a little more a resonates louder in political surface circles than it does with an execution is florida is lou is a threat internationally for a few things happening in some states in america constitutional carry which is now and half of the country that is actually something that has a lot of international concern it cant fathom how americans gold gun culture continues to maintain the status quo but they really dont understand how someone can walk into a store buy it a k style weapon without a background check some of the loopholes we have they do not understand that there is a perception abroad that guns are everywhere in america we know most states dont have open carry some states do its not like everybody is walking down the street with a weapon because more states are loosening gun laws in more places are allowing,0.0
portlands gun violence where are the guns coming from,police believe most crime guns in portland are either stolen bought through an illegal straw purchase or obtained through the,elected leaders they say its all hands on deck to fight gun violence literally that was the headline in the multnomah county website in september after a press conference featuring the dea and the sheriff theres too many guns in the hands of people that shouldnt possess them so we have a lot of firearms that are in the hands of people that pose a grave risk to our community which got me wondering where are these guns coming from theyre coming from a variety of sources to better understand i met with portland police sergeant mark friedman it would not be uncommon for us in a weekend in portland right now to recover the number of firearms youre seeing displayed here in one weekend in one weekend in the first nine months of this year portland police seized more than guns thats far more than all of last year the confiscated guns come in all shapes and sizes some old some new but most more than half the guns seized by police are semi automatic pistols what makes semi automatics particularly appealing to criminals is they generally have higher capacity than revolvers meaning they can fire more shots before having to reload its one of the more inexpensive missiles that we see we see a lot of them police theorize most crime guns in portland are obtained illegally from three different sources through their stolen bought through a straw purchase or picked up in the underground gun market jason chatty is with atf and based in seattle the vast majority come from private citizens who havent secured their firearms properly and theyre stolen either from their homes or their vehicles several shootings in portland including the september murder of lasalle shekere have been linked to stolen guns court records spell it out guns used in violent crimes and murders are also coming from straw purchases thats when someone who cant legally buy a gun maybe a convicted felon has someone buy it on their behalf last month federal prosecutors accused portland gang members of straw purchasing more than guns investigators linked the illegally purchased guns to shootings in the portland area and then theres the underground market youd be amazed how many how many gun transactions are facilitated by the use of social media snapchat and tick tock theyre filled with images of young men and their guns the weapons are often traded for drugs or money a couple change hands and walla youve got a firearm its the availability and sheer number of guns on the street that frightens seneca alexander senior he lost his year old son to gun violence im sure that anybody can get a gun that that wants to get one and some of the guns are being modified into mini machine guns weve recovered at least a handful of these this year in several cases police found guns altered with whats called a glock switch or glock auto sear which is illegal the result just listen to the automatic gunfire picked up on a security camera in portlands old town in late august police figure most the guns used in portland shootings are obtained illegally but its important to note legal gun sales there through the roof last year oregon had a record number of background checks which suggests more people are getting guns people afraid so you might not have somebody who is a gang member or someone who is in that life but they might have a gun in there scared often a single gun is used repeatedly in multiple different crimes theres data to prove it police analyzed spent casings and found so far this year of the guns have connections to another portland shooting suggesting that the same guns are being passed around or used by repeat shooters these crime guns often moving back and forth on the street are responsible for most of portlands gun violence ok kgw kayla boxi joining me now so kyle the first question i have i mean if these illegal guns are being moved on the street is there anything that can be done yeah i think one of the biggest things at least what police say is to prevent lost and stolen guns too often theyre finding guns stolen in home burglaries or car prowls the problem is those guns they end up on the street so gun owners i mean theyve really got to lock him up and we know youve been tackling this issue really one question at a time so im wondering if you can tell us whats the next question theyre going after sure were kicking around a lot of different ideas really ghost guns theyre untraceable theyre becoming more common were thinking about maybe looking into that also do rewards work those rewards do those work to help solve crimes these are just a few of the ideas though wed love to hear from you if youve got anything specific to gun violence in portland send us your questions right as our viewers know this story at kgwcom is the place to send those kayla boushey thank you so much,0.0
how to reduce the rise in mass shootings and other gun violence across the us,there are growing calls for new gun legislation across the us after a spate of deadly mass shootings thomas abt a senior,campuses we begin with the growing calls for new gun legislation nationwide americans across the country are in morning after a dozen mass shootings were reported over the course of the weekend alone and since last friday there has been mass shootings carried out from coastto coast more than a dozen people dead and dozens more injured following the spike in violence again nationwide three mass shootings reported in the state of michigan alone there is one in particular we want to talk about a all the escalated into a shootout on saturday night three people killed their and more injured in that violence a few hours later people were shot and two killed outside of a nightclub in chattanooga tennessee lets bring in thomas for more on all of this he is a senior hello on the counsel of criminal justice and the chairman of the violent crime working group and he is the author of the book bleeding out thomas welcome of course we are talking about the most recent shootings we saw you write about how gun violence is an issue and has been for decades even if mass shootings dont draw the same public outrage in those in others how do you suggest we finally begin to connect those thoughts and get a handle on gun violence nationwide that is a great question unfortunately the united states is an outlier among other wealthy nations we have a gun violence rate that is times higher than our wealthy peers really the united states is not facing one gun violence problem but really four related but distinct problems you have mass shootings you have community gun violence or street violence you have domestic gun violence and you have suicide it accounts for more deaths than homicides some policies work best on one type of violence and other policies work best on another type of violence we need a network or a set of policies in place to address all four of these challenges the general principle that holds thomas is that when a country has more guns there are more gun fatalities and injuries as a result how do you regulate that market and weapons to make sure the people who have them are not doing the wrong things with them my question is a simple when of the day do we need legislation can it be done without legislation i think that certain types of gun violence and need to be addressed through legislation but other types are less acceptable to legislation for instance red flag laws could have a significant impact on reducing domestic violence and they have been shown to reduce suicides those are balls where you can go to remove the guns from the house the person has been found to be dangerous on another hand bans on assault weapons or high magazine clips could reduce the legality of mass shootings like the ones like the terrible when we just all in uvalde the community gun violence the everyday gun violence that is the vast majority of homicides in our country most of that violence is perpetrated because guns are already illegal their unique partnerships between law enforcement and community groups to identify those at the highest risk for violence and engage that and give them a series of characteristics curious things happen to people go out and buy more guns and gun to go to the roof people see other people dying in the streets and they say i want personal protection people out there right now who have been following the coverage and have been thinking to themselves you know what if everybody else has a gun i want too what do you say i say that there is pretty good evidence that if you have a gun in the house the risk of you being a victim of gun violence goes up not down now owning a gun is a personal choice but i think that you also if you want to own a gun i think that you have to seriously consider the responsibilities with that are you ready to store that gun safely are you ready to trade with that gun are you willing to make sure that everybody in your household understands those precautions and doesnt have access particularly kids its a complicated decision but i think its not as easy as some people think yes definitely tru,0.0

here to talk about the thing that makes america truly exceptional no not butter statues of jesus although that is magnificentand garrett earned his win today were talkinggun violence in america i know its heavy americans are times morelikely to be murdered by guns than people in the top wealthiest nations on earth and in death by firearm search among american kids and adolescents dethroning motor vehicle crashes as their most common cause of death and if youre less of a human life and more of a numbers person gun violence costs america anaverage of billion a year in medical bills and lost productivity also its really darkthat its someones job to figure out how much productivityis lost to gun violence and yet an alien coollyobserving american pop culture or american politicscould reasonably conclude that guns rule thats because despitethe carnage they inflict a sizable portion of america continues to really really love them they occupy a special protected place in our cultural psyche which makes just about any conversation about policy surrounding it super polite and totally civilized no not at all its like little kids arguingabout toys except their guns that can kill

guns are more than a bitplayer in american history by some historians accounts the american revolution brokeout over anger at britain for stopping shipmentsof firearms to america and for confiscating colonistslimited weapon stockpiles i still think the storyabout tea is cute though the founding fathers sawguns as a useful tool for hunting and for collective protection owning a gun was mostly mandatory for a certain subsection of white men and some colonies requiredthem to carry their guns to church and public meetings imagine getting tooledup and going to mass oh you wouldnt go to mass cause they hated catholics then as tensions between thecolonies and britain heated up guns seemed like the only line of defense against an oppressive monarch gun culture looked very different though guns were privately owned but they were seen as collective assets a shared stockpile to beused by citizen militias and colonial legislation dictated that in case of emergency the government couldbriefly repossess your gun for use in battle yes they could literallycome into your house and take your gun dramatic music another important thing the founding fathersdidnt only love guns they also loved gun control like how as a white man you could only own a gun ifyou met certain criteria like having a clean criminal record swearing loyalty to the union or in some places not being catholic which if you were towitness my family reunions would make a lot of sense too much booze for guns and of course black people essentially couldnt own guns at all and even if you did meet allthe criteria to own a gun your use of it was heavily regulated you had to register itwith the government and there were regularinspections to make sure it was ready to be used by the militia certain places had even stricter laws in boston you couldntkeep a loaded firearm inside a building not even your own home basically the founding fathers seem to have believedin gun control measures that were conducive to public safety and wigs they alsoreally believed in wigs i guess they were selfhating bald men and thus i dont respect them all of this amounted to an early america that wasnt an especiallyviolent place to be except for the whole war with britain and genocide againstnative american stuff not a lot of guns were made here and those that were werehandcrafted by gunsmiths who like todays task rabbits typically had to work multiple other gigs because there wasnt enoughdemand for their product shout out to all my real housewives and lower tier bachelorcontestants out there but in the early th century the fledgling us army wanted to beef up specifically by acquiring uniform guns with interchangeable parts previously every gun had been custom made with custom measurements so industrialists startedinventing the technology that would make gunsmiths irrelevant infrastructure for the massproduction of standardized guns their plan was to scorebig government contracts and make bank selling guns commercially to individuals didnt even occur to them one key player in this was samuel colt also known as dr samuel colt a performer known for staging big shows where he gave peopletoo much laughing gas audience laughing but this guy saw more potential in the mass manufacturing of guns and he went all in inventingthe revolving cylinder which allowed guns to holdmultiple rounds of ammunition rendering them significantly more lethal and definitely not as fun as laughing gas gun makers would continue to come up with other ways to make their guns more lethal as a selling point but colt quickly realized hehad two really big problems one the army didnt wantto buy large quantities of these newfangled guns and two operating at capacity his factory could create farmore guns than he could sell there just wasnt enoughdemand for something that at the time was largelyseen as an instrument of war so colt and his fellow gun manufacturers had to get creative they had to artificially manufacture a civilian demand for their product what a thing to artificiallyinvent demand for a product thats crazy im glad they stopped doing that im glad thats never happened since that would suck to live in that world one company hilariouslypatented a cane gun which yes is a cane that shoots bullets tragically it wasnt a big hit dramatic percussion music for his part colt was all about marketing and heavy discounts but frustrated bylackluster american demand he started thinking internationally a warhappy europe was alltoo willing to fill the void as historian pamela haag puts it it was the europeanregimes of the mids embattled with each other and brimming with imperial ambition where the demand for guns ran highest colt began to see the world as his market arming europe wouldembolden those countries to encroach on asia and then yay asia would need guns too which is very cool and not atall cynical logic mr colt dr colt he traveled abroad bringing lavish gifts to important statesmen and arming anyone who could sign a check that included supplyingweapons to russia and turkey in their ongoing war its fun when people killing each other is good for business by the s nearly all gunsin europe were made in america via what was functionally the beginning of modern globalization but back to the s for a sec gun makers still faced a problem gun sales were better during times of war but relying on governmentcontracts meant poor sales during times of peace one of colts competitorsoliver winchester had an idea what if instead of wedding himself to american government contracts he cultivated a commercial gun market winchester imagined his idealcustomers not to be soldiers but to be what haagcalls citizendefenders who would buy guns in defenseof their homes and land this is when gun ownership started being less about the earlylogic of collective defense against an oppressive government and more about individual selfdefense against a dangerous frontier the struggle to cultivate thisdream market was for a time abated by the civil war which as you might imagine created a huge demand for guns and for a man like colt itoffered two hungry markets the union and the confederacy thats right this ambitious dickbag armed both sides of the conflict causing the new york timesto accuse him of treason but the wars end brought new problems hundreds of thousands offirearms flooded the markets so many former soldiers now owned guns that the gun market turned abysmal and gun makers looked backto international customers and they were not discerning as scholars rachel stohland suzette grillot write manufacturers took advantageof laissezfaire economics and sold weapons to interested customers no matter who or wherethey might have been arming despots and dictators alike and presumably finally the catholics american guns spread everywhere from fiji where they replaced boomerangs to alaska where they armed inuit people for hunting at the time in say britain gun dealers scrutinizeeach customers character and integrity in america the vibe was more you get a gun he gets a gun she gets a gun the dog gets a gun take this gun for off guns so we know by now thatcivilians owning guns is not as american as butter jesus so how did america go fromgunagnostic to gunloving advertising and lots of it marketing historian robert henning argues that advertisements were key to inventing and shaping american gun culture this advertising reliedon the romanticization of the wild west where the wellarmed frontiersman was literally manifestingmanifest destiny or just literally manifesting destiny i dont know as legal professor adam winkler notes in his book gunfight cultural observers haveargued that the frontier was not only the root ofthe american character but also the origin of americaspropensity for violence the wild westification of america was envisioned through promotional imagery of western frontiersmenand taglines like god created men colonel colt made them equal okay so now hes mr colt dr colt and colonel colt i dont buy it meanwhile wildlypopular dime store novels written on the civilized east coast told violent tales of greatgunslingers in the west cementing the frontiers legacy in this way guns werepresented in popular media as the antithesis of propereast coast industrial society despite the fact that gunswere solely being manufactured in places like new haven connecticut and so the east mythologizing the west began to really arm the country winchester also recognizedthe importance of imbuing guns with a sort of symbolic importance anthropomorphizing theirsupposed character the great advantage ofthis rifle over all others consists in the moraleffect it has he wrote ive never read a book of moral philosophy where someones like chapter two why guns are virtuous guns were starting to becomea sign of selfsovereignty a symbol of american individualism so you might be thinking americas idea of violencecame out of the west so the west must havebeen super violent right not so fast cowboy the wild west had tons of guns but it also had something in common with the founding fathers lots of gun control you may picture the wildwest as one big rowdy gunslinging saloon but evidence shows thatmurder rates were minimal most people felt so safe theydidnt even lock their doors as winkler notes almost everyone carried firearmsin the untamed wilderness which was full of dangerousnatives outlaws and bears in the frontier towns however where people lived andbusinesses operated the law often forbade people from toting their guns around some of this was strategic frontier towns weresmall but wanted to grow and to do that they needed to seem safe while lore of westerngunfights mainstreamed guns and cowboys as twin symbolsof an individualistic america the actual west knewthat they couldnt afford to be as violent as their mythology still the romanticization of the west was a highly successfulmarketing strategy and around the turn of the century gun sales were booming this is when the gunreally went from serving as a tool of necessity toserving a psychological need as haag puts it what was once needednow had to be loved which would be a really beautiful quote if it wasnt describing a gun luckily it was the perfect time for that historian kristin hoganson among others has argued that genderbasedanxieties of the time engineered a new preoccupationwith a return to manliness via boxing footballwar and of course guns for president teddy roosevelt the gun was a remedyagainst the rapid changes of modern life which hadbrought about a corporate economy antithetical to theindividualist american mythos anyway the mystique ofthe gun obscured the fact that the gun industry was as much a part of the modern corporateeconomy as any other when world war i hit the gun industry had to step up with winchester securing contracts to immediately produce the equivalent of five years worth of orders ironically this time war was a riskyproposition for gun makers they had to take out massive loans to expand their factories toaccommodate all the demand and after the war manywere drowning in debt they tried to rebuild viamassive advertising campaigns that continued into the mids they targeted among other groups women and boys as young as via pamphlets that raved about four american boys whoare famous rifle shots which is a real advertising slogan and not something written by a spambot winchester retailers were told to put a winchester into the hands of every youth in your town with the overall goal ofarming millions of boys aged to which isobjectively a pretty wild thing to put on your vision board its crazy that now were worried about young people playing video games but back then we just gave them guns advertisements stoked fearsthat the war had come home and danger lurked on every street colts ads warned that responsibility for theprotection of your property your home your loved onesis too serious a matter to be entrusted to anarm of doubtful lineage guns were touted as totems of masculinity protecting men from becoming soft images of wholesome youngredblooded american men could assure anyone worriedthat america was not in fact degenerating into a nation of lounge lizard anemics as the industrial manufacturer news bureau delightfully put it also if lounge lizardanemics isnt a band yet someone watching this start that band you know youll have good merch advertisements some modeledafter liquor companies were teaching people totruly love their guns gradually this sentimenthelped create consumers who saw guns not as objects of necessity but as objects of desire and like me buying merchoutside of a dead show these kinds of consumers would buy way more beeps than they needed the lore of american gunculture was persuasive by winchester couldstraightfacedly boast the slogan winchester more than agun an american legend a legend they had authored themselves but okay sure as haag puts it oneanswer to the question why do americans love guns is simply that we were invited to do so by those who made and sold them at the moment whentheir products had shed much of their morepractical utilitarian value still popular media ranwith winchesters narrative offering that casual assertions that americans had always loved guns or that they had a timelesstradition of gun fluency as haag writes for much of our history americans were actually pretty bad at actually shooting the guns in fact the nra wasformed after the civil war specifically because someveterans were alarmed at the horrible marksmanshipof union soldiers for much of its history the nra was more abouttargetshooting competitions than influencing politics though today its rhetoricis fiercely antigovernment the early nra relied on major subsidies to help build gun ranges and taxpayers even got the privilege of funding their annualcompetition in ohio but then came the sand s and with it prohibition and a hugespike in urban crime and again with prohibition like why is everyone alwaystrying to keep the catholics from doing what they love this violence was personifiedby the ruthless mobster who was typically armed with a tommy gun a highly lethal machinegun that caused violence on a scale once unimaginable gun control remained a toughpolitical sell though by now gun manufacturersand americas war department had a symbiotic relationship the war department feared that if gun businesses couldnt find markets during times of peace they wouldnt be preparedfor times of war its hard to imaginenow but during this era the nra actually steppedin and lobbied states to enact gun control measures the sheer magnitude of mob violence created enough political will in congress to pass the national firearms act the law and subsequent additions to it effectively halted the proliferation of machine guns permanently retrospectivelyhistorians view it as proof that successful gun controlis possible in america and then things were basicallychill on the gun front until this happened you may have heard of the black panthers an activist group thatorganized against racism and police brutality andbelieved that arming black people was the best path towards racial justice though theyre maybe bestknown for carrying guns and having really goodmonochromatic outfits they most importantlyprovided community resources like their free breakfastprogram for children leader huey newton argued that the civility of thecivil rights movement hadnt fixed anything and more radical action was necessary at one point this took theform of armed black panthers legally wielding guns as they protested at the california state house nows a good moment to talk about the link between racism and gun culture gun regulation has been used for centuries to block black peoples access to guns in colonial times enslaved people and even free blackswerent allowed to own guns because colonists fearedtheyd use them to rise up hell the kkk began as agun control organization no seriously it formed after the civil war to confiscate guns from blackmen including veterans guns became an importantmeans of protection for freed southern blackpeople to fight violent racism with some black men formingmilitias to stop lynchings a century later the blackpanthers similarly decided that carrying guns for selfdefense was the only way they couldgain respect and safety and that really freaked white people out in fact the panthersso alarmed lawmakers that they helped inspire the strictest national gunregulation america had ever seen the gun control act of along with the omnibus crimecontrol and safe streets act these laws were also inspiredin part by collective grief over a series of political assassinations including mlk jfk and robert kennedy the laws expanded federallicensing for guns and they forbade exfelons people with certain mental illnesses illegal drug users andchildren from owning guns and it restricted imports of socalled saturday night special guns which were frequently used in crime and different fromsaturday night fever guns which were real sparkly and played disco music when you shot them note that the nra supportedsome of these measures and even reluctantly endorsed the law and yet even as politicalwill favored gun control the gun industry still receivedsome special protection from higherups it was the sole industryto be exempt from oversight via the new consumerproduct safety commission created in according to the trace this is because houserepresentatives feared a slippery slope thatwould lead the agency to confiscate peoples guns this functionally means thattheres more federal oversight over a toy gun than a real one which is too depressing to be funny seriously it means that thegovernment has more oversight over this plastic piece of crap than a gun that shoots bullets i dont know oh beeps it also has real consequences plenty have pointed outthat gun manufacturers could make guns safer by fixing flaws in triggerlocks or personalizing guns so they can only be used by their owner but without federal oversight theres no incentive forthe industry to make sure all guns sold meetminimum safety standards but back to the gun control measures thatdid make it through congress would have a complicated legacy as winkler notes if it hadnt been forthe black panthers there might never have beena modern gun rights movement thats because he explainsthese new strict laws which were aimed largely at disarming urban black leftist radicals led to a backlash byrural white conservatives now you may be wondering why we havent mentioned oneof the essential talking points of the gun rights debate in america the second amendment which reads a well regulated militia being necessary to for thesecurity of a free state the right of the peopleto keep and bear arms shall not be infringed theres a good reason ithasnt come up though until the s the second amendment wasnt one of the popular kids it didnt play into the gun debate and was generally ignoredby legal scholars the supreme court did useit to uphold challenges to the law arguing that sawedoffshotguns and machine guns wouldnt be used by a state militia and thus could be regulated this was the militiainterpretation of the amendment that it only protected gun rights insofar as they would apply toarming a citizen militia but scholars in the sand s started arguing for a more individual interpretation of the second amendment and the nra went hamon this interpretation even bolting an excerpt of the amendment to the outside of their headquarters eventually the individual interpretation would be borne out in asupreme court decision on district of columbiavs heller in which overturned dcs ban on handguns in a hotly controversial decision the question of the individualvs militia interpretation remains contested by scholars for his part back in former chief justice warren burger called the individual interpretation of the second amendment one of the greatest pieces of fraud i repeat the word fraudon the american public by special interest groups that i have ever seen in my lifetime were not gonna go toodeep on the second amendment and not just because thedebate is pretty boring the thing is we actually dont think this clause of the constitution is as essential to the gun debate as its been made out to be because lets say you do take the strongest individualistinterpretation of the amendment holding that the founding fathers believed in the protectedindividual right to own a gun well the founding fathers as you know also believed in lots of gun control so clearly they felt that thisright could be infringed on if it meant protecting public safety that is to say you can both believe in the individualistinterpretation of the amendment and believe that gun controlmeasures are necessary because you yes you contain multitudes but back to the s now armed with revelatoryconstitutional backup the nra leapt into the decade establishing an official lobbying wing where both the nra and cocaine the s were a hell of a decade ironically though mostly white the group borrowed a lot ofthe black panthers arguments that guns were necessary for selfdefense not only in the home but on the street where bumbling cops surelycouldnt be relied upon there was some lingering tension though between the old guards who had cooperated on gun control laws and newer more radical members who believed any form of gun control was a slippery slope tohaving their gun room raided by communists the antigun controlextremists staged a coup at the nras national meeting in setting the nra on a more aggressive path at the same time a decision by the supreme court allowed for unfettered political spending the nra refocused on campaigndonations and fundraising funneling millions into localstate and national elections in the process they gainedsome serious lobbying power not that much gun controlwas liable to happen under the winner of the nras first presidentialendorsement ronald reagan energized by reagans win the nra pushed legislation thatprotected the gun industry that included the firearmowners protection act which restrictedinspections of gun dealers loosened the rules oninterstate gun sales and made a federal databaseof gun ownership illegal speaking off the record some politicians admitted thatthey only voted for the law because they were intimidatedby the nras power what a system of government we have other big wins includedmaking it extremely difficult to sue gun manufacturers removing law enforcementspower to use discretion when issuing concealed carry licenses and preventing local governmentsfrom regulating firearms but as the s wore on nramembership started declining once again it would take the threat of new federal gun control to bring the organization back to life jim brady was serving aswhite house press secretary when he was shot and partially paralyzed during an assassinationattempt on reagan in his attacker coincidentallywas just released from prison and now has a sizablesocial media following because we live in a weird world brady and his wife becamegun control activists and in theyintroduced the brady bill requiring backgroundchecks on all handguns sold by licensed dealers it finally passed in followed by an assaultweapons ban in both of which inflamed the nra as the washington postexplains in its book guns in america nra rhetoric got gnarlier and gnarlier in a fundraising letterpresident wayne lapierre wrote that the assault weapons ban gives jackbooted government thugs more power to take awayour constitutional rights break in our doors seize our guns destroy our property andeven injure and kill us when onetime nra member timothy mcveigh blew up the alfred pmurrah federal building in oklahoma city in april of the nra was criticized forits antigovernment rhetoric which some thoughtencouraged the militant why ever would they think that the organization triedto improve its image under the presidency offamous actor charleton heston through great pr move like holding its nationalconvention in denver two weeks after columbine surely a mistake theyd never make again except for when they did theexact same thing in houston three days after the uvalde shooting great job nra really good planning more strategically thegroup allied heavily with george w bushs campaign in leading to this delicious bit of pr for everyone withinthe sound of my voice to hear and to heed and especially for you mr gore audience laughing from my cold dead hands citing bushs eventual victory fortune magazine ranked the nra the most powerful lobbyingorganization in the country but the aughts broughtvictory after victory the assault rifle ban expired in and in the supreme court knocked down the dc handgun ban ironically the nra mayhave lobbied its way out of relevancy the organization is strongest when people feel their gunrights are under attack the organization wouldeventually lose steam in the late s thanks to lawsuits leadership scandals a bankruptcyfiling that was rejected and overall declining membership their political donations have proportionately dwindled down although they still managed to spend over million dollars inthe federal elections with the nra dying a slowdeath its worth asking what does that mean for gun culture honestly not a whole lot gun rights continues to be a winning issue for republicans courting primary voters lawmakers might no longerfear retaliation from the nra but they do fear looking like theyre trying to take away peoples guns meanwhile gun sales havenearly tripled since spiking especially overthe past three years presumably so people couldshoot the novel coronavirus and not get sick we live in violent times with american gun deaths up from and thats a increaseover the previous five years in the last years that figures risen with faith in lawenforcement generally down its no wonder that peopleare looking to arm themselves or increase their stockpile and that idea brings us backto the issue of selfdefense which has been sold as thecentral reason to buy a gun since the midth century and has only become amore compelling reason in recent years machine gun firingwoman screaming woman hunny canyou bring mommy the mop now wanting a gun to protect yourself in a country thatsswimming in them is fair but if you think owning a gun makes you pardon the expression bulletproof the data really doesnt bear that out estimates of the number ofdefensive gun uses range from to over million per year depending on methodologies sample size and the definition of defensive gun use given discrepancies in data criminologist thomas gabor recommends looking at police officersas a reference point since they are armedtrained to wield guns and not infrequently encounter danger according to james fyfe anexpert on police gun use a bigcity cop is involved in a shootout every years on average again thats every years on average almost half of a thousand years another calculation foundthat in any given year only one in cops isinvolved in a shooting as gabor concludes these numbers show thateven police officers who are armed and aremore routinely involved in dangerous situationsthan the average citizen rarely rely on gunswhen doing police work unless their talking to aharmless young black person then they definitely need guns no thats not gonna go inthe video but its true this raises the question why would people doingfar less dangerous jobs need to be armed all the time but theres a much deeper problem with the selfdefense argument research from the centers ofdisease control and prevention found that more thanthreequarters of homicide victims knew their attacker because of this bringinga gun into the home actually poses more of athreat to the residents than it poses defense against intruders sort of like if you bring beers into your house youre more likely toget drunk from the beers than if you didnt bringthe beers into your house was that a scientific comparison no but if you bring beers into your house what do you thinks gonna happen this is particularly true for women who are two to four times more likely to be intentionally killed by a gun if they live in a house with one if the person youre most afraid of is the person sharing your bed putting a gun under your pillow isnt exactly a setup for safety as harvard professor and public health expertdavid hemenway summarizes scientific studies suggest that the health risk of a gun in the home is greater than the benefit and that a gun in the home may more likely be usedto threaten intimates than to protect against intruders add to that the increasedlikelihood of homicide suicide and accidental deathsoccurring in houses with guns and it becomes an evenmore dangerous prospect by the way weve linkedtwo domestic abuse and suicide supportlines in the description this all suggests that on a micro level the mere presence of gunsincreases the likelihood of multiple forms of violence this has been borneout in other countries for example when israelstopped letting soldiers bring their guns home on weekends soldier suicides decreasedby a staggering this all suggests that having guns around simply makes violence more likely again if youre in a bar youre more likely to get drunk if youre in a bathroom youre more likely to go to the bathroom the failure of guns to deter crime are clear on a regional level as well in the south was theregion with the highest rate of violent and property crimes the northeast had the lowest of households in the south had a gun compared to ofhouses in the northeast as gabor concludes theseregional comparisons provide no support for the idea that higher gun ownership levels serve as a net deterrent to crime now theres an obvious reason gun sales tend to go up after a mass shooting people want to be prepared although they account forapproximately onehalf of of gun violence in the country mass shootings garner the most headlines and political attention and this makes sense though were more likely to be killed by a family member or afriend than by a stranger mass shootings remind us that we cant simply avoid gun violence just by being nice to our momor picking the right friends the first modern mass shooting as defined by journalist seamus mcgraw who i would bet my life isa catholic occurred in when a man opened firefrom a tower in texas and killed people and so the romanticized imageof the lone american gunman protecting himself from bears mutated into the lonegunman turning his weapon on innocent civilians withno clear motive or agenda over the coming decades the mass shooter typically young white and male would become a collectiveboogeyman in the american psyche reporter tonightauthorities say theyve arrested the alleged gunman identified as an yearold white male from conklin new york in response to recent mass shootings including the one at uvalde elementary there have been calls to arm teachers we should be skeptical of the idea that a good guy with a guncould offer much protection in the event of a mass shooting first of all not evencops who are trained hit their target the majority of the time indeed inspector kevinmaloney of the nypd reported that in city cops hit their targetjust of the time also if there was aplatonic name for nypd cop it would be kevin maloney logically you wouldhave to expect a teacher to underperform a cop and in a crowded public space missing your mark canmean killing someone else secondly having multiplepeople firing guns at a crime scene is a recipefor police confusion and chaos police learn this atthe texas tower in when several onlookers startedfiring back at the shooter stoking even more panic journalist seamus mcgrawwrites in his book from a taller tower that as john mcdonald executivedirector of security at jefferson county publicschools told the denver post in such situations addinganother gun to the mix can have tragic consequences thirdly modern firearmshave become so lethal that a bystander cant reallyprevent profound loss of life in one example in ohio the police responded within seconds but not quickly enough to stop the shooter from killing nine peopleand wounding more even if jason bourne was your teacher even he likely couldnt respond in time given these facts the results of fbi studies of activeshooter scenarios make sense they found that only concluded with a good guy with a gun firing a shot meanwhile were stoppedby unarmed civilians again that means that unarmedcivilians have done more to stop mass shootingsthan good guys with guns whats more if we wantto know what happens when you have more good guyswith guns in their pockets we can simply look to somelatin american countries where guns are basically ubiquitous yet certainly have notmade communities safer rather wellarmedcountries like guatemala honduras and el savadorhave some of the worlds highest homicide rates as rebecca peters former director of theinternational action network on small arms argues a society that isrelying on guys with guns to stop violence is a sign of a society where institutions have broken down its shocking to hearanyone in the united states considering a solution that would make it seemmore like colombia also worth noting many of those countries have guns because reagan shipped themdown there in the s you just google that its all real i swear to god in contrast though switzerland has a high rate of gun ownership but a very low rate of gun homicides in part because guns are mostly seen as official military weapons rather than tools for selfdefense switzerland brings usto a separate question why is america so uniquely violent compared to other wealthy nations theres a lot of factors but you probably wont be surprised that other countries areworried that american violence might be contagious as then prime minister john howard said after australias portarthur massacre in we do not want the american disease imported into australia unlike in america massshootings in comparable countries have been followed bysweeping gun control action and while its almostimpossible to imagine america taking action to meaningfullycurb gun violence at least with all thepartisan gridlock in play many other countries have pulled it off after the previously mentioned massacre australia swiftly rolled out stringent gun ownershiprequirements and restrictions along with a huge gun buyback program after a school shootingin the uk also in parliament rolled out asimilarly strict set of laws and there hasnt been a schoolshooting in the uk since in other words the onion got us again which makes it all the more depressing that american gun violencecontinues unabated of mass shootings inindustrialized countries have occurred in ye olde united states even though we make upjust of the population as of early june there had been morethan mass shootings in the us this year alone where does this uniquelyamerican violence come from according to mcgraw some of it is the resultof a media culture that valorizes fame he writes that thirst forfame runs deep in our culture and it can make peopledo terrible things now obviously america is verymuch a fameobsessed society but there are plentyof aspiring celebrities all over the world and youdont hear about scottish goths shooting up schools for the clout so that still doesnt explainwhat makes mass shootings so damn american some of its rooted in goodoldfashioned prejudice frequently mass shootersare taking their anger out on an identity group whetheranother race as in buffalo religion as in thetree of life synagogue or women as in isla vista california but in recent years theresbeen a chilling development of mass shooters streaming their violence and going viral in the darkcrevices of the internet this strengthens the idea that theyre searching forsome sort of twisted glory maybe in their heads theyare the lone american gunman romanticized throughout our culture indeed mcgraw notes thatcertain types of guns take on a fetishistic elementamongst mass shooters a sort of twisted extensionof our national love of guns when a mass shooting happenstheres an instant rush to figure out the cause ofsuch senseless violence and theres inevitably talk about the mental illnesscrisis in america which while being a very real problem is a bit of a misdirection stats suggest that upto of mass shooters have some form of mental illness and certainly if americahad better resources for mental health care maybe those shooterscould have been treated before resorting to violence but what about the other while certainly not in a great headspace given the whole mass shooting thing these people arentexplicitly mentally ill rather they often exhibitsigns of narcissism with a deep sense ofgrievance against the world but we cant just goarresting all the narcissists on the off chance thatthey can go postal can we wait can we cause i have a list ofsome narcissists in my life that i would love to give the authorities whats more some ofguns used in mass shootings were purchased legally so its not like betterenforcement of existing laws could have stopped them there is one thing most mass shooters have in common though domestic violence over twothirds of mass shooters either killed family or intimate partners or were involved indomestic violence disputes on a larger scale the overlap of domesticviolence and mass shootings suggests that rather thanbeing some kind of fluke or outlier they are an extensionof the broader structures of everyday american violence much of which is predicated on the extreme lethality of modern guns so is there something embedded in the dna of americas history that just makes us more prone to shoot people were not sure but it does seem like a series of factors ranging from americas colonial past to western expansion to an economy built on war to an emphasis on individualliberty above all else to underfunded mental health care to the way domestic violence is ignored until it becomes lethal yeah thats a lot of stuff theres a lot of things oh its very overwhelming these things have allcoalesced in the modern era to make america in mass shootings and other gunrelated deaths and because its not justone or two or three things at the root of this problem it sadly seems like theres no easy fix but hey you can use an online dating app meet and marry a swiss national and then you can live in a country where you can own a gun andeat unlimited toblerones without worrying about mass shootings but what do you guys think is there something inherentlyviolent about america can our gun violenceproblem ever be fixed

gun violence runs rampant in america heres the impact in arizona,one year ago news is looking at the impact of gun violence in one week in maricopa county,when it comes to gun violence america is one of the most violent countries in the world a year ago this week people died from gun violence and another were wounded in response we decided to take a closer look at gun violence with our series seven days shootings in america trying to put a face on the problem taking a look at the victims and survivors one year later last night we asked for your views the i teams erica stapleton has been going through those comments and joins us now with more of her series erica thats right mark we received a comment yesterday that asked what role drugs play in gun violence and since we got that last night our team started pulling research to try and answer that question so to start the investigation ive been working on focuses on one week ago last year this week last year and in maricopa county there were shootings people were killed and more were injured and we cant say how many involved drugs because there arent enough records that tell us are publicly available to us to determine one way or another we did request records on all ten of those cases eight of which are still open and some of those requests remain pending still our team looked for answers and while the research is somewhat sporadic or limited what we found has a consistent message that drugs appear to have at least some influence on crime including homicides and shootings first stating all the way back to the s when the department of justice reviewed crime data in cities nationwide and concluded quote that arrestees were often under the influence of a drug at the time they committed their offense keep in mind a lot has changed in the past three decades and even at that time they clearly stated that it was impossible to say quantitatively how much drugs influence the occurrence of a crime the doj archives dont show more but recent dont show more recent data but we did find a study from philadelphia last year that shows another link between drugs and gun violence that areas where gun violence increased in the city also had high drug market activity so we havent been able to publicly to replicate that study here in phoenix or find researchers who have done that but what both of these and other links we came across consistently show is a connection between drugs and gun violence and thats one thing that public health experts are trying to address in some really unique ways across the country take a look at whats happening in charlotte nc when a patient comes in here with a gunshot wound and we take a bullet out of their arms were not really treating the disease because at least in my view weve come to realize that the disease is related to a lot of the social ills that all of our communities are sort of facing doctor david jacobs heads atrium healths emerging violence intervention program which offers survivors immediate help from within the hospital in charlotte nc well evaluate that patient take an inventory of what their their acute social needs might be are they homeless do they need a tattoo removed they need to get out of a gang do they need a job do they need what do they need in order to get their lives on a positive track once we have that inventory then we set about writing a prescription like you would any other patient for what its going to take to prevent the next violent injury in their lives so far in charlotte theyve helped patients and work with different social services providing a model that could work in other parts of the country if we can perhaps change the trajectory of that one persons life we may be able to change the trajectory of many folks at that individual comes in contact with and that model matches with the cdc also recommends to start tackling the root cause and risk factors we have links to those recommendations on our website which you can access by pulling out your phone right now and clicking on this qr code again risk factors arent just about drugs domestic violence and even teed violence also have to be addressed this qr code will take you to all that on our website with a page with all that information and more mark erica thanks when you watch reports like this and you see the collateral damage left behind by gun violence how should we react do we go on as if this epidemic isnt happening or do we say okay enoughs enough lets sit down and figure this out before the next school shooting maybe at my kids school also the second amendment guarantees the right to bear arms but should gun rights outweigh human rights in america the right to live safely without fear of being gunned down the night at erica continues her reporting looking at the impact of gun violence on teens and their families and what solutions parents want to happen right now and of course wed like to hear from you if youve been impacted by gun violence or you want to hear more reporting about solutions send us a text message at the number on your screen o to as we continue this series well read some more of your comments

americas numbness to gun violence,with mass shootings so far in some have become numb to americas gun violence problem juanita tolliver and,the second amendment is the second amendment is becoming a suicide pact it feels like thats another question what about other kids going to school what more can we doand we look at that all the and we look at that all the time we will continue to file whatever we can and continue a national conversation we never seem to stop gavin newsom was visiting victims of monterey park mass shooting when he was pulled away to be raised about another one thats what im half moon bay pointing to the gun violence archive mass shooting events in just days this whole year archive defines a mass shooting as it is inserted with four more victims shot not including the shooter we keep having the same conversation but tonight we are not going to just move on so lets discuss with juanita tolliver msnbc political analyst and host of crooked medias and what a day podcast and msnbc senior political analyst matthew dowd hes a former george w bushs strategist and founder of country over party juanita it can be very tempting to get into the nominees does nothing new to say lets move on earlier tonight i was not sure if we should cover it but i was wrong how do we treat this issue with the urgency it deserves by naming the fact that our national solution is still needed in order to prevent this from ever happening again and the public support is there for it stephanie of the country on of the country still believes we need stricter gun laws and i was after the last bit of legislation passed last year of the country still believes that we need to ban high capacity magazines which was used by the shooter monterey park and thats why i think its important were talking about this because more and more americans are going to feel the pain and trauma and devastation and impacts of gun violence not just in mass shootings but in gun violence that happens every year across the country and my big fear is if we look away mets more reason for congress to not act thats more reason for our state legislators not act so emphasizing this and the only key to stopping the shootings is to limit access remove weapons of choice weve seen repeatedly used by the shooters thats whats gonna be key here its the only thing thats gonna change situation we are neatly uniquely experience in this country thats what we keep doing over and over matt to each of these events republican say its time for thoughts and prayers it is too soon to politicize this tragedy but then the new cycle moves on in hours and we forget about it until next shooting happens we have to get it hopefully well dont forget about it they forget about it we know what to do as juanita laid out we know what to do this isnt rocket science we know exactly what to do and we know her stats but she laid out is true even gone honors gun owners want the same thing as we got older want the exact thing when you pull gun owners they want universal background checks they want limits of weapons i want agents thats gun owners in this the problem is is that we have a republican party today who are only concerned with of the population that put of the population is who votes are deterrence whos gonna win their primaries thats the problem the american public has done making public use ruling on this we keep saying what they want the democrats in power know what we want but this is to me an example of the structure that exists today and how it is aligned is not undemocratic stretcher today we dont have a democratic structure today if the vast majority of the country wants this done it is not getting done something is fundamentally broken in our system fundamentally broken in our system and this is an area that i wish we can go to any number of nine ten other countries are not having this problem and say what did yall do what are you all do here and they would last off the exact same thing with the juanita just listed off but they knew they have none of these problems so having a show on this talking about this important speaking out continues to be important on this but in the end until the republican moves off of the and pays attention to the majority were gonna keep out of this problem heres my headscratcher though and people say we cant politicize gun violence is not exactly what we need to do if this endless tragedy is not enough for a political solution a change in government policy what would be right right so no to the nra to reject the donations to do its right to actually save lives and that was more than ten years ago now and whats wild to me that this seems to be no ceiling here nothing will ever be too much for the republican party to turn the backs on the nra as matt was talking about the system is fundamentally broken the system is related to donors having control harmful industries having control of what legislators are comes committed to doing and setting boundaries and what they wont touch sadly gun violence prevention is that third rail for republican parties they live in die by the nra rating that needs to change because what they need to prioritize the needs their community i dont know what the hell is gonna wake them up staff stephanie stephanie every time i hear i guess so irritated every time you hear it on a given example the marbling goes down the field what if someone said no medics were offering thoughts and prayers and then a medical ambulance comes they say no no no no were giving him thoughts and prayers and we look at it we couldvedone all these things done all these things thats repairs im all for thoughts and prayers the thousand pairs require action before we follow thoughts and prayers of action were gonna keep having these deaths after thats out todays across the country and its uniquely american exceptionalism thing not the receiving lives but lives are dying

many children who survive gun violence face barriers to mental health care,firearmrelated injuries among children have been on the rise with nearly in children experiencing gun violence,d injuries are on the rise according to the latest data nearly in every children experience gun violence ali rogin has the latest on what this is doing to the mental health of children across the country ali since guns have been the leading cause of death for children in america while many tragically lose their lives child survivors of gun violence can endure a lifetime of physical and mental health challenges a new study from the american academy of pediatrics points to the urgent need for connecting children to mental health services following a firearm injury the study analyzed medicaid data of children aged to who suffered a nonfatal firearm injury it found that of these children do not receive mental health services within six months after a firearm injury the research noted black youth are less likely to have any mental health follow up than white youth jennifer hoffman is a pediatric emergency medicine physician at lurie childrens hospital of chicago shes also one of the lead authors of the new study jennifer thank you so much for joining us first of all this seems l such a no brainer that if children are going through a traumatic event like a firearm experience that they would have access to mental health services why is this not the case why is this not ubiquitous jennifer unfortunately theres so many barriers for children to access mental health care in the united states we know that one in five children in the us has a mental health condition but only half receive needed mental health services and there are many reasons for this ranging from under recognition to stigma but also structural barriers such as workforce shortages of mental health professionals ali for this study in particular why look at mental health services following a firearm injury jennifer as a pediatric emergency medicine physician its devastating to me every time i have to care for a child whos experienced a firearm injury and if the child is lucky enough to survive the experience can be very traumatizing for them research shows that firearm injuries can have lasting impacts on child mental health so we wanted to understand which children were able to connect with mental health services and which children could do so in a timely manner ali what did you find in terms of the differences between children who received follow up mental health care and those who didnt following a firearm injury jennifer we found that children who had mental health needs detected during their injury visit were more likely to receive timely mental health services so that means if mental health needs are recognized during the emergency department visit or hospitalization they were able to connect sooner with mental health care thats important because early treatment is more effective and it allows children to respond to more simple interventions such as outpatient therapy rather than waiting for symptoms to progress and become more severe requiring intensive treatment like psychiatric hospitalization ali what does that early intervention look like in the aftermath of a firearm injury if a child is receiving mental health services what sort of interactions are we talking about jennifer it can vary it can be simple treatments provided in the primary care office it can be a referral to a therapist for outpatient therapy or it can be more intensive care as needed based on what the childs experiencing such as the day program or occasionally even a hospital stay if needed we found that some of the most common mental health conditions that occurred after a firearm injury were traumatic related disorders such as ptsd we also found increases in substance use among children after their firearm injury and double the rates of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and suicidal thoughts and selfharm ali what are some of the barriers to children receiving this type of care following these incidents jennifer there are too many barriers and one reason is that there are significant workforce shortages of mental health professionals in the us but particularly in high poverty areas in those communities where most firearm injuries occur and this is also compounded by limited reimbursement rates for mental health services particularly those offered by medicaid relative to private health insurance and the reason that we focused the study on medicaid enrolled youth is that most youth in the us who sustained firearm injuries are enrolled in medicaid ali wow and that leads into my next question i think which is what did you learn about the racial disparity in these numbers the fact that black youth are less likely to experience mental health services in the aftermath than other other races are jennifer this is a troubling finding but unfortunately it wasnt surprising to our research team given a large body of evidence showing there are disparities in access to mental health care among us black youth and there are many possible reasons for this ranging from familial factors stigma cultural barriers but more importantly structural barriers such as a lack of mental health providers in the communities where black children live and a substantial lack of diversity in the mental health workforce ali so what does that mean in terms of what policymakers can do what would you like to see change jennifer first of all i think that policymakers should make more substantial investments to improving access to mental health services for children and this includes meeting children where they are investing in school based mental health services also telehealth mental health services that can connect to children in communities that dont have an inperson mental health provider also policymakers need to increase research funding to address and prevent firearm injuries by applying a public health approach we know that research on firearm injuries is substantially underfunded relative to the morbidity and mortality burden ali absolutely and lastly jennifer what types of resources should parents and caregivers be aware of when it comes to mental health related to these sorts of events jennifer it is important for parents to have open and honest conversations with their children and if you have any concerns about your childs mental health talk to your pediatrician first they can provide an initial assessment and referrals if indicated also if your child experiences a mental health crisis dont leave them alone call the national mental health hotline to be connected to a trained counselor ali and of course we can talk much more about the spate of gun violence incidents in this country but we will leave it there jennifer hoffman with lori childrens hospital of chicago thank you so much for your time jennifer thank you for having

texas lawmaker outlines legislation needed to reduce gun violence,democratic texas state sen roland gutierrez reacts to the deadly shooting at a texas outlet mall gutierrez criticizes gov,horrible horrible stories morgan chesky thank you so much joining me now is texas state senator roland gutierrez senator gutierrez id like to get your reactions to this horrific shooting and why you might think that officials have yet to make public anything about the suspect victims i understand victims need to be notified are you hearing anything about that alex weve tried to reach out and find out ages from some identifiers as to who the eight the victims are we received no such information we are understanding that a press conference should be undertaken very soon and hopefully well be able to get more information i want to ask you about how im feeling this is horrendous its déjà vu all over again i want to compare that gentlemen in the cowboy hat that was there that witness that little girl without a face those are images weve seen in uvalde that ive seen on body cams but compare what he said to what governor abbott said on fox news earlier saying look this is a mental health crisis this is a mental health problem this is a problem that is unique to the united states more unique to texas and this governor has done nothing at all to solve the common denominator which is access to guns in the hands of menial people clearly nobody gets up in the morning and a criminal says im going to do this most of the people to undertake these types of mass shootings have no criminal history greg abbott is completely wrong hes completely misguided and he is completely failed the people of texas strong words right there you are not wrong and you wrote a particular pointed tweet last night saying this there is a special place and healthy people who watch all this happen and choose to do nothing hashtag blood on their hands so look this shooting comes barely a week after five people were caught youve called out the governor who else needs to be cold out here listen the governor dan patrick ted cruz last week they blamed it on an immigrant with an ar how did the immigrant the ar get the ar he got it because of the loose gun laws that these people have put into place there is not a democrat or a republican out there that thinks it is common sense to allow people to walk down congress avenue in austin texas or any other street with an ar and not even have a policeman asking a question as to what hes doing because that is the state of the law in texas you can walk around with your ar fully loaded and nobody can even ask you a question that is the chaos that greg abbott dan patrick and others have created in the state that is their chaos and they need to own this the anniversary of the shooting at robb elementary in uvalde county in your district one of the deadliest shootings ever at a texas public school as you know its coming up at the end of the month and youve repeatedly introduced legislation four sets of bills addressing gun safety talk about the kinds of laws that need to be passed to help prevent these shootings from happening and mike one of them might have prevented what happened yesterday yesterday clearly we filed extreme protective order laws you have to imagine that this person was mentally ill if he had made threats to others if others had known of his position of firearms as is the place in florida by the way where theyve executed of these its worked well law enforcement is greatly in favor of it we dont know how old this person is to see if the age limit wouldve changed anything universal fact ground checks we dont know how he obtained the gun there is so much that we dont know by this time and sadly at the pace that texas law enforcement goes may not ever know but we have to be able to get this information so we can avoid this from happening again we have three weeks before the legislative session ends we can do age limit increases to we can do extreme risk protective orders and we can do close the gun show loophole where everybody gets a gun we dont even have to show a license in texas thats how pathetic our gun laws are at gun shows quickly sir we will get a response to a republican congressman representing allen he responds to people who feel prayers arent enough they said quote those are people who dont believe in an almighty god he is absolutely in control of our lives ive said this earlier look they got i believe and gives us free will he allows us to make our own decisions and he allows lawmakers to make laws that make sense to protect people the bible says to protect those that are in power those that are an elected office micahs theyre supposed to have wisdom and someone theres not a whole lot of wisdom in the texas house and clearly theres not a whole lot of wisdom in congressman themselves their identification or understanding of the bible we have a lot of work to do we are broken in this country the chaos that is happening is happening because republicans like him and others in congress and in our texas capital have a lot of this chaos continuing more guns does not equal less,0.0
